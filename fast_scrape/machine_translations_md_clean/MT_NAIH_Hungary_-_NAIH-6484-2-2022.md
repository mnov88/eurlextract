## English Summary

### Facts

On 25 March 2021, the data subject noticed that the National Health Insurance Fund Manager (NEAK) “published” information on its website that the data subject registered for the COVID-19 vaccine. By entering their social security number and date of birth, anyone who knew these pieces of personal information, could check the validity of a person’s registration. The data subject e-mailed the controller on the same day, objecting to the processing of his personal data on the website.

On 6 April 2021, the data subject sent another e-mail to the controller, this time invoking their right of access under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"). They also requested the controller to send the date and IP address from which the data subject requested the vaccination registration. As they did not receive any answer from the controller, the data subject turned to the DPA on 11 May 2021.

The controller neither responded to the DPA's request for clarification, nor did it inform the DPA of the reason for the delay and when the data subject could expect a substantive response. Therefore, the DPA carried out an on-site visit at the premises of the controller on 24 November 2021. During the visit, the DPA found that the controller logged all the data requests in accordance with the requirements of its privacy policy and had the data subject’s request as well.

The controller responded to the data subject only after the visit of the DPA, on 26 November 2021, and even then not in substance, saying: “As reasoning for the delay, we would like to mention that (...) NEAK has received nearly 70,000 requests for vaccine registration.” The controller also claimed to process and respond to thousands of inquiries per day, using the same number of human resources employees it had before the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller's reply did not contain any information on the right to lodge a complaint or to seek redress. Therefore, the DPA declared an infringement of [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 12(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR"). Additionally, the DPA held that the controller, whether or not it considered the request under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"), should have dealt with it within the time frame under [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR").

As the controller mentioned that there were another unanswered requests, among the altogether 70,000 requests, the DPA requested the controller to provide evidence. However, the DPA did not receive the evidence promised to be sent until the present decision became final. Nevertheless, the DPA took into account – as a mitigating factor – that the COVID-19 pandemic required the establishment of data management processes on an unprecedented scale and at very short notice. The controller could not have previously assessed the resources needed to ensure the data subject's rights, but had to ensure them with unchanged human and budgetary resources.

The DPA concluded that registration for vaccination does not automatically mean that someone actually takes the vaccine, therefore it did not constitute processing of special categories of personal data. The DPA interpreted that the displayed information on the status of registration in itself was not necessarily disproportionate to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The protection measures applied in the identification process may be proportionate, and for these measures, the controller was responsible.

On November 30, 2021, the Applicant informed the Authority (NAIH-4820-12/2021) that the
He received a reply from his application on November 26, 2021, in which the Applicant informed him that
that since the data subject submitted his requests by e-mail, "based on his data" in the e-mails
it is not possible to identify him, however, this is "the assessment of his objection and the data
from the point of view of service (…) it is essential". The Applicant further informed the
Applicant that "e-mail is not considered a form of written contact, moreover

in the absence of identification, it is not possible to return the requested data
way".

In the letter attached as evidence by the Applicant, the Respondent called the Applicant to

"your application, if you have a customer portal, (...) into a private document with full evidential force
busy (…) please send it”.

As a reason for the delayed response, the Respondent informed the Applicant that "it is

an inquiry was received regarding vaccine registration for NEAK. Mass vaccination
thousands of inquiries per day were processed and answered

Following the on-site inspection conducted by the Applicant on November 24, 2021, the
Not in any way about the measures taken in connection with the applicant's exercise of stakeholder rights

"after authentication, the customer portal asks me to send my application again", as well as complete proof

binds the exercise of the rights of the affected party to the form of a valid private deed, despite the fact that the personal
this was not necessary when collecting data. According to the Applicant, this violated the general rule
of Article 12 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, because the Respondent did not comply with "easily
accessible form" of his obligation to provide information.

In the supplement to the application, the Applicant also complained that the Respondent is the general
data protection regulation "5. further processing of my personal data contrary to points b) and c) of Article

determined when I was given my birth name, time and place of birth, and my mother
asks you to enter your birth name." The applicant considers this unnecessary for identification,
"after all, in relation to the data processing affected by the protest, only my name, e-mail address,
I gave my date of birth and social security number".

At the same time, in the addendum to the application addressed to the Authority, the
Applicant:

"Possibly, the Requested Party wishes to connect the subject data management with data management for other purposes
(illegally), do you need these data? For my current question, I ask NEAK as the data controller

Although from the content of the electronic letter of March 25, 2021 submitted by the Applicant to the Authority
it can be established that the Applicant is Article 21 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
he did not specifically refer to "reasons related to his own situation" according to
he stated that "the fact that I was registered for vaccination was made public".
in the opinion of the Authority, despite this, if the Respondent does not accept the Applicant's request
would have identified a legitimate objection under Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation
as a request, even in that case he would have been obliged according to Article 12 (3).

to respond within the deadline and with the content according to paragraph (4). Failure to respond is
during the procedure, the Respondent clearly acknowledged both the Authority and the Applicant.

In response to the Applicant's request to exercise the right to object received on March 25, 2021, only
He replied on November 26, 2021, and not even then in substance: "In order to justify our delay
I would like to say that (…) nearly 70,000 inquiries were received regarding vaccine registration
for NEAK.” According to the respondent, the processing of thousands of requests per day and

was answered, "using unchanged human resources capacities".

During the inspection conducted by the Authority at the Applicant's headquarters on November 24, 2021, its
according to the minutes, the following questions and statements were made:

       "3.1. "Declare whether you have arrived at the National Health Insurance Fund Management \[...\]
       from an e-mail address, or in any other way according to the general data protection regulation

       application for exercise of data subject rights on March 25, 2021 and April 6, 2021,
       or at any other time?”

       A protest was received on March 25, 2021. On April 6, the Applicant received the one concerning him
       log file access request to NEAK.

       3.2. "If so, please state whether you have responded to these stakeholder requests?

       Please respond to your statement separately, for each stakeholder request received!"

       NEAK has not responded to these yet, it is in progress.

       3.3. "Declare for each application whether you have evaluated them on their merits, as well as whether
       whether they were assessed within the deadline prescribed in the general data protection regulation?"

       The general information is awaiting signature, according to the Applicant's statement. The logging

       for legal exercises.

       3.4. An employee of the Authority asked him to make a statement: "If not until today

       responded to the request or requests of the person concerned in the subject matter, please state as such
       about the reason why he didn't do it!"

       The Applicant submits:

       Since March 11, 2021, more than seventy thousand, according to the General Data Protection Regulation
       a request for the exercise of the rights of the affected party has been received, which it is unable to fulfill

       sufficient human resources are available, a total of four people are available on a case-by-case basis
       legal advisors of the Legal Department and regional bodies are also involved.

       In relation to the inquiry system, a total of inquiries were received from two stakeholders, viz
       one of the applicants involved in the case in question.

       The third issue related to the query system is that it was hit by a load attack

       filed a complaint with the investigative authority due to the attack, criminal proceedings were initiated in the case
       At the National Bureau of Investigation.

       The request of the applicant was presumably lost among the large number of requests.

       Currently, 100-150 requests are received per day, which is a manageable amount."

Based on the above, the Authority established that both the Applicant and the Respondent
his statement is the same in that until his application is submitted, the Applicant has nothing
he did not receive any information from the data controller, neither on the merits nor on the extension of the deadline
and the need for additional information needed to identify the Applicant
regarding. In addition, the Respondent's answer of November 26, 2021 did not include either

The Authority subsequently rejected the Applicant's request, according to the relevant part, because a

according to the data controller's information, you already know in accordance with the procedure of the Requested Party

he didn't understand it.

III.2. Presumed violation of the exercise of the right of access

The Applicant, since he did not receive a response to his protest request dated March 25, 2021 from the Application,

with reference to Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation on April 6, 2021
submitted a request to the Respondent via electronic mail, requesting:

"please send me exactly when and from which IP address I requested the TAJ/birth. date

                                               By entering with combination 10, my vaccination registration data".

Because the cited stakeholder request is Article 12 (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation
neither a substantial response within the one-month deadline, nor an extension of the deadline

did not receive relevant information regarding the conduct of the Applicant's data protection official procedure
submitted an application to the Authority.

During the clarification of the facts, the Authority referred to III.1. as described in point, established that
the Applicant also did not receive a response from the Application to the stakeholders sent on April 6, 2021
upon request, as well as by March 25, 2021.

Based on the above, the Authority established that the Respondent, regardless of whether a
received a request for access according to Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation
whether he considered it or not, he would have been obliged to do so within the time limit according to Article 12 (3), (4)
to be judged on the merits with the content according to paragraph. This is not disputed by the Respondent
due to his absence, the Authority decided according to the relevant part.

III.3. The supplement to the application, the obligation to identify the person concerned and the information about it
information

On November 30, 2021, the Applicant sent another submission citing new evidence to the
For the Authority (NAIH-4820-12/2021.). The Applicant attached the Respondent November 26, 2021-
dated F022/25-3/2021. reference number, F022/37-2/2021. letter with file number, in which a
The Respondent informed the Applicant that "for the merits of his protest and the requested

that your identification is not based on the data available in the e-mail
possible, which from the point of view of the assessment of your objection and the provision of data -
given that it affects the rights of the stakeholders, it is essential."

The Applicant objected that the Applicant did not evaluate his data subject requests even within eight months
in merit. He considered it unjustified that the Respondent did not respond to the merits of the requests in full

subject to submission in the form of a private document with evidentiary value, with customer gatekeeper identification,
even though the only legal requirement for the submission of the application is the identification of the customer, a
a private deed form with full evidential force is not.

According to the applicant, this violates Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation in that a

The applicant further explained: "Contrary to points b) and c) of Article 5 of the GDPR, additional

I provided and attached my data in my application to the Applicant.

(…)
I respectfully ask the Authority to proceed with its procedure for the above infringement also with a Request
opposite."

In view of the new application (supplement to the application) submitted on November 30, 2021, the Authority
established that, despite the incomplete reference, Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation
(1) of Article points b) and c) and Article 12 (1) presupposes a violation.

Pursuant to Article 12 (6) of the General Data Protection Regulation, "if the data controller
you have reasonable doubts about 15-21. a natural person submitting an application pursuant to Art
regarding his identity, it is necessary to further confirm the identity of the person concerned

                                               11 may request the provision of information".

According to the Authority's point of view, the duty of the requested state data controller is to the affected parties, such as a
It is the responsibility of the person concerned to establish the identity of the Applicant involved in the subject matter (identification).

prior to securing rights, for which simple e-mail is not suitable, lack of identification
may lead to a data protection incident. Against Cov-19 operated by another data controller
the identification of the person concerned was not realized on the vaccination registration interface either, and
In the case of the Respondent, no further action was taken in relation to the Applicant.

NAIH-4820-11/2021. Pursuant to the Protocol of inspection no. the Respondent is clear
position on the identifiability of those involved: "Simple identification of the logging results

does not allow e-mail inquiries due to the lack of identification of the data subject
to send, given that they refer to special personal data. It's common
the procedure is to ask the person concerned to fill in the gaps, you are a private document with full probative value
in urgent cases, it is performed by confirming the knowledge of four natural personal identification data
that."

At the same time, as part of clarifying the facts, the Authority ex officio examined the

Information provided upon registration on the website vaccinainfo.gov.hu, on the Applicant's website
information on data management, as well as on the query interface related to the matter in question
(https://vakcinareg.neak.gov.hu/regisztracio/AdatkezelesiTajekoztato.pdf) available
informative content.

However, none of the information sheets contain how the data subjects can be identified
themselves before the requested data controller during the exercise of their data subject rights, as well as

that requests from unidentified data subjects will not be answered at all.

However, according to the information on the query interface:

"The data subject in the event of a violation of his rights related to the processing of his personal data, as well as his rights

According to the Authority's point of view, if the Applicant, according to the specified rules, only

In view of the above, the Authority rejected the request in this regard, according to the relevant part.

Furthermore, according to the relevant part, the Authority established ex officio the general data protection

III.4. Lack of the Respondent's obligation to cooperate during the procedure

The Authority NAIH-4820-6/2021. s. already assessed the Respondent's previous default in its decision
and imposed a procedural fine, but nevertheless requested it repeatedly in the same order

During the on-site inspection conducted at the Applicant's headquarters - based on its minutes - a
The respondent's representative submitted that the Authority did not comply due to internal organizational reasons

According to the testimony of the minutes, the Authority in support of the fact that during the on-site inspection
as stated, the approximately seventy thousand referred to by the Respondent actually occurred

                                               13 Despite this, the Authority did not send the promised evidence until this decision became final
got it.

In view of the above, the Authority decided according to the relevant part and established it ex officio

According to Article 31 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Respondent is obliged to cooperate
in relation to the period following the failure to pay a procedural fine.

III.5. Querying the status of online registration on the website vaccinainfo.gov.hu

In his application, the Applicant objected that by specifying the TAJ and his date of birth a

The status of your online registration on vaccinainfo.gov.hu is directly the query
appears on the interface, in this way the Respondent has made his personal data public.

Since the Authority is not obliged to act based on mere assumptions, NAIH-4820-2/2021. s.
in point 5 of the order, called on the Applicant to state whether he can prove that,
that it actually became known to an unauthorized natural or legal person
the fact of its registration.

NAIH-4820-3/2021. in his answer filed under the account, the Applicant stated that he also
sought an answer to the question, but the Respondent did not respond to the stakeholder's request.

The Authority states that the vaccination against the coronavirus occurred on the site vaccinainfo.gov.hu
online or by returning the form sent by the Hungarian State Treasury

the fact of registration does not mean that the vaccine is actually taken by a person concerned and therefore does not
constitutes the processing of special personal data.

Based on the above, the Authority's position is that although the query interface is indeed direct
displays information about the status of the registration, this in itself is not necessarily the case
disproportionate to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, variable probability and
with serious risks, the protective measures applied during identification are known

they can be proportional to data circles. Consideration of this is the task of the requested data controller.

Based on the above, the Authority rejected the request in the query interface
regarding that the Respondent, if the Applicant properly identifies himself
before that, he is obliged to comply with the Requester's access request, which will reveal that
whether an actual infringement has occurred. If such a real violation of the access request
on the basis of the given answer, the Applicant will likely, on the basis of this evidence, as a violator

affected by data management, can request the Authority's procedure with the data manager who committed the violation
opposite.

However, the Authority did not substantiate the violation with evidence, based on its mere assumption
does not act on a stakeholder request, so it decided as written in the operative part.

III.6. Legal consequences

The Respondent did not inform the Applicant in a timely manner that it was personal identification
in its absence, it cannot evaluate the data subject's requests to exercise their rights. THE
however, following delayed information, the Applicant provided the available,

Therefore, the Authority granted the Applicant's request and found that III.1.-III.4. according to point

the Applicant because he violated Article 12 (3)-(4) of the General Data Protection Regulation

                                               14 by not providing the Applicant with information on the rights of the data subject for personal identification
until November 26, 2021. As a result, point a) of Article 5 (1) is violated
the principle of transparency, as well as Article 31 of the General Data Protection Regulation during the procedure

In addition to this, the Authority - the III.5. subject to what is written in point - the Applicant refuses to do so
your request to establish a violation of the alleged disclosure of your personal data
in the subject matter of the decision, a violation of the principle of purpose-bound data management and data saving,
as well as regarding the management of personal data of other natural persons.

The Authority examined ex officio whether due to the established violations, the

When imposing the fine, the Authority considered the following factors as aggravating factors:

1. The violations committed by the Respondent are Article 83 (5) of the General Data Protection Regulation
according to point a) of the paragraph, the violation belonging to the higher fine category
are considered to be related to a basic principle.

2. The violation is serious because the Respondent, with its data management, violates the Applicant's data subject rights
hindered its exercise, by the fact that only the Authority, significantly late to the stakeholder's request
responded after his on-site inspection. \[general data protection regulation Article 83 (2) a)

\[general data protection regulation Article 83 (2) point f)\].

When imposing the fine, the Authority considered the following factors as mitigating factors:

1. The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in data management processes
required its establishment within an extremely short period of time, with related stakeholder rights
in order to ensure that the data controller was previously unable to assess the necessary resources,
it had to be provided with an unchanged number of human and budgetary resources. \[general

2. The Authority had previously provided the Applicant with the provisions of the general data protection regulation

he has not yet been convicted for his violation. \[Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
point (e)\]

3. There was no evidence indicating that the Applicant actually suffered damage (loss)
would have arisen as a consequence of the Respondent's default. \[general data protection regulation
Article 83(2)(k)\]

By imposing a fine, the special preventive goal of the Authority is to encourage the Applicant
to review its data management practices in connection with the provision of data subject rights.

The amount of the fine was determined by the Authority acting within its statutory discretion.

                                                 15 Based on the above, the Authority decided in accordance with the provisions of the statutory part.
