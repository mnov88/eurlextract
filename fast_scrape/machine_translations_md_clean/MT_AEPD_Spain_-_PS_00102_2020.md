## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant had illegally sent his/her electricity bill (including his/her name, passport number, address and part of his/her IBAN) to a third party not related to him/her.

### Dispute

The defendant did not answer to any AEPD investigation requests, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have infringed the confidentiality principle as per Article 5(1)(f) GDPR: after considering the available evidences, the defendant had not been able to guarantee an adequate level of security of the personal data processed. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) the absence of intentionality but significant negligence, and (ii) the disclosure of basic personal data\], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 40,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine with two possible discounts: (i) early voluntary payment (32,000 €) and acknowledging of its liability (24,000 €). The defendant agreed to both concepts, so it paid 24,000 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.
