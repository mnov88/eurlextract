## English Summary

### Facts

Clearview A.I. Inc. (Clearview) is a company conducting facial recognition on public web sources and is the data controller. Four data subjects had sought information from Clearview under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"). Clearview replied to three of them and provided “special reports” containing the results obtained through the Clearview software. In 2021, these data subjects complained to the Italian DPA (Garante per la protezione dei dati personali) regarding the processing of their personal data by Clearview, without their consent. In addition, two "organisations committed to defending the privacy and fundamental rights of individuals" submitted information about precedents in Germany and Sweden, and their reports on activities of Clearview to the DPA. Based on the press reports on the activities of Clearview and the complaints submitted to it, the DPA opened an investigation.

Before the DPA, Clearview submitted as follows:

The GDPR was not applicable and the DPA lacked jurisdiction as Clearview was not offering its services in Italy and had utilized technical measures to block Italian IP addresses from accessing services of Clearview. Clearview was not carrying out any monitoring activity as per [Article 3(2)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_3_GDPR#2b "Article 3 GDPR"), and its search results were akin to Google Search. Clearview did not have a list of Italian customers, and its privacy policy did not refer to GDPR. Clearview did not have a representative in the Union as mandated by [Article 27 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_27_GDPR "Article 27 GDPR"). Accordingly, the activities of Clearview were not covered by the GDPR.

Since 2019, law enforcement agencies in the United States (US) were using Clearview, “especially in the context of child pornography investigations”. This generated international interest and several European government agencies signed up for a test account for a short time.

In March 2020, following complaints by regulators in European Union (EU), these test accounts, which were very few, were closed.

Clearview does not have any customers in the EU, and it ensures the same through “specific setting that prevents access to the software via European IP addresses.”

Clearview’s technology is used by law enforcement agencies and assists them in identifying criminals. As per Clearview’s terms, it is the responsibility of its customers to “verify that the use of this product is legitimate in light of the local regulations applicable to it.”

Clearview contractually requires its users to conduct further investigations and independently corroborate information collected using Clearview.

Clearview is based in the US and has no branch in the EU. It neither offers its services in the EU nor monitors behaviour.

Clearview did expand to Canada but ceased all its activities in Canada following the proceedings initiated by the Canadian Privacy Commissioners. This expansion cannot be considered to demonstrate its intention of entering the Italian market.

Journalistic sources cannot be relied upon as they are speculative.

The Swedish decision was concerning the above test accounts that existed for a short period and were available to Swedish police forces.

Clearview did not conduct any behavioural analysis or use any profiling techniques. Collection of data, even of significant volume, does not automatically constitute profiling.

The Data Controller is Clearview’s customer (i.e. police forces) and not Clearview itself, and this was held by the Swedish authority.

Clearview “does not collect or provide any information about the location, browser history, business activity or behaviour of the natural person who appears as a search result and does not imply any behavioural, predictive or analytical modeling. The information that can be obtained about an individual using Clearview's search engine is less meaningful than the information that can be obtained from a Google Search based on that individual's name, and no one is claiming that a Google browser search constitutes behavioral monitoring.”

Clearview is compliant with US law and it is impossible to take into account all existing laws in a globalized world. “Moreover, since Google's search engine is presumed to comply with European laws because Google is established in the EU and offers its services to users in the EU, if the Regulation were also found to apply to Clearview, the processing of the complainant's data should be considered lawful”.

Clearview voluntarily complies with requests for access from European residents, even though it is not bound to do so.

### Holding

The DPA determined as follows:

Clearview “not only collects images to make them accessible to its customers, but also processes the collected images by web scraping, through a proprietary facial matching algorithm, in order to provide a highly qualified biometric search service.” As per its website, the free service is not available to the public but only to certain category of customers (i.e. police forces). Therefore, “the platform offered by Clearview assumes peculiar characteristics that differentiate it from a common search engine that does not process or enrich images present on the network. In particular, Clearview does not work on cache memory, but creates a database of snapshots of images that are stored as present at the time of collection and not updated. Moreover, as mentioned above, Clearview processes these images with biometric techniques, hashes them and associates them with any available metadata”. Thus, its services are not like those being offered by Google.

Clearview is the data controller as it “uses its own means to collect images and subsequently transform them into biometric data, and has a proprietary database in which the information is stored and extracted as a result of the search performed by the user. The purpose pursued by Clearview is therefore that of making available, in return for a fee, information such as images and metadata, useful to customers for the pursuit of different and additional purposes.”

The DPA has jurisdiction and GDPR is applicable to Clearview as it once did offer its services to European users. Moreover, Clearview’s activities, as revealed from its patent application filed in the US constitute “monitoring of behaviour”. In addition, Clearview’s website states, “the data collected include not only photographs available to the public and available on the Internet, but also information that can be extracted from those photographs, such as the geolocation metadata that they may contain, as well as information derived from the analysis of the faces of the persons depicted and which, as such, constitute biometric data on the basis of which the comparison process is carried out.” Accordingly, [Article 3(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_3_GDPR#2 "Article 3 GDPR") is applicable. Moreover, the issue of DPA’s jurisdiction and powers qua Clearview has also been decided by CNIL in a different matter.

The photographic image of a person, as long as the person is identified or identifiable, constitutes personal data. The fact that the photographs were already available on the internet “is not sufficient to consider that data subjects can reasonably expect them to be used for facial recognition purposes, moreover by a private platform, not established in the EU and of whose existence and activity most data subjects are unaware.” Web Scraping activities are almost always prohibited by social media platforms and press reports have shown that “Twitter, Youtube, LinkedIn have sent Clearview a cease and desist letter to stop collecting data that can be used to identify a person.”

Clearview not only collected personal data but through further processing converted a photograph into biometric data.

Clearview did not comply with [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR") “which requires compliance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency in the processing of data with regard to the data subject”.

Clearview violated [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR") which “provides for compliance with the principle of purpose limitation.”

Clearview violated [Article 5(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1e "Article 5 GDPR") which “provides for compliance with the principle of storage limitation.” This was because there was “no indication of any retention period either from the analysis of Clearview's privacy policy, or from the feedback received from the Company, which was incomplete on this point, or from the information contained in the complaints submitted by the interested parties.”

Clearview did not have any valid basis under [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") for the processing of personal data. It’s claimed legitimate economic interest “cannot but be at odds with the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, and in particular with the serious threat to the right to privacy, the prohibition of automated processing and the principle of non-discrimination inherent in the processing of personal data such as that carried out by the Company.”

Clearview violated [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") due to its “processing of special categories of data (with reference to biometric data).”

Clearview violated Articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 GDPR as the data subjects “had to repeat their requests for access several times before receiving a reply from Clearview, despite the fact that the contact channels indicated on the company's website (online form and e-mail address dedicated to privacy requests) had been used.” Moreover, “Clearview, in order to process requests for access, has asked the interested parties to provide identification, such as an identity document, which is excessive in relation to the objective pursued” as there were no “reasonable doubts” as to the identity of the data subjects. Clearview did not provide timely, complete, up to date, “precise and transparent communication” to the data subjects.

Clearview breached [Article 27 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_27_GDPR "Article 27 GDPR") by not having its representative in the territory of the EU.

There were no grounds to determine a violation of [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR") as Clearview had “not provided any specific evidence in this regard, and no technical system elements are currently available that could corroborate the thesis of the existence of automated processing.”

Clearview’s violations were considered to be serious as they were akin to mass surveillance. They were not isolated events and continued even after “service was no longer offered to customers established in the European Union.” Thus, the DPA directed Clearview to do the following:

1) Prohibit (any further) processing of: i) collection, by means of web scraping techniques, of images and related metadata of data subjects on Italian territory; ii) common and biometric data processed through its facial recognition system of data subjects on Italian territory.

2) Delete the “aforementioned data, without prejudice to the obligation to provide timely feedback to requests to exercise the rights” given under Articles 15-22 GDPR, “which may have been received in the meantime from interested parties. In the latter cases, in order to facilitate the exercise of rights by the data subjects, the response must be provided in accordance with the timeframe and procedures set out” in [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR").

3) Designate within thirty days “a representative in the Italian territory to act as interlocutor, in addition to or instead of the data controller, with the interested parties in order to facilitate the exercise of their rights.”

4) Provide “adequately documented feedback, within thirty days of notification of this measure, of the initiatives taken to implement the above order” and “measures put in place to facilitate the exercise of the rights of the persons concerned.”

5) Pay a cumulative sum of €20,000,000 for violating Articles 5(1)(a), (b) and (e), 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 27 GDPR.

3. OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION
3.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SERVICE OFFERED
Clearview is a company, with registered office in the United States, incorporated in 2017, which has created a
facial recognition search engine. On the basis of
information obtained in the course of mutual assistance with other European supervisory authorities
the information disclosed by the Company itself and the complaints and reports received by the
complaints and reports received by the Garante, it appears that the facial recognition platform developed by Clearview allows the
Clearview's facial recognition platform enables it to search for images in its own database. The Company, in fact, collects, through
web scraping techniques, images from social networks (e.g. Twitter or Facebook), blogs and, in general,
from websites with publicly accessible photos, but also from videos available online (e.g. on Youtube).

As can be seen from the company's website (https://...) the platform 'includes a database of over
10 billion facial images from public web sources, including news media, mug shot websites, social media
mugshot websites, public social media and other publicly available sources'.
The machine learning technology that underpins the Clearview platform was the subject of a
patent application filed in February 2021 with the US Patent & Trademark Office on 11 February
2021 and to the World Intellectual Property Organization.
This application shows that the technology, referred to as "Method for providing information about a

Clearview, therefore, not only collects images to make them accessible to its customers, but
Clearview not only collects images to make them accessible to its customers, but also processes the collected images through web scraping, using a proprietary facial
matching algorithm in order to provide a highly qualified biometric search service.
Moreover, according to the information available on Clearview's website, the free service offered is not
freely accessible to the public, but is intended for certain categories of customers (i.e. police forces).

This leads to the conclusion that Clearview's platform has specific characteristics that differentiate it from

and not updated. Moreover, as mentioned above, Clearview processes these images with biometric techniques, hashes them and associates them with the network.
Moreover, as mentioned, Clearview processes these images using biometric techniques, hashes them and associates them with any available metadata.
The statements made by the Company to the effect that the service it offers is superimposable on the service
The Company's allegations that the service it offers is similar to the service offered by Google Search therefore appear to be unfounded.

For the purposes of the applicability of the targeting criterion set out in Article 3(2)(a) of the Regulation,
on the basis of the indications contained in the "Guidelines 3/2018 on territorial scope

conduct of the "controller, which determines the means and purposes of the processing ,
demonstrates its intention to offer goods or services to a data subject located in the Union' (cf.
paragraph 2.a of the cited Guidelines). In particular, Recital 23 of the Regulation states that

The Court of Justice of the European Union itself (Pammer v Reederei Karl Schlüter GmbH

Article 3(2)(b) of the Regulation
The second of the criteria of targeting identified, that is, that of Art. 3, para. 2, letter b), leads to
the application of the European Data Protection Regulation to the processing activities related to the
monitoring of the behaviour of data subjects in the European Union which takes place within the
Union.
The nature of the processing activity that can be considered as conduct monitoring
is specified in Recital 24 of the Regulation, which provides that in order to "determine whether
a processing activity can be assimilated to behavioural monitoring of the data subject, it is

subsequent use of personal data processing techniques consisting in the profiling of the
individual, in particular in order to take decisions concerning him or her or to analyse or predict his or her
their personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes".
The aforementioned Guidelines 3/2018 specify that, for the provision to be operational,
it is not necessary to investigate the existence, on the part of the data controller, of the intention to
"to target a subject", but that, nevertheless, "the use of the word "monitoring" implies that the

c of the above-mentioned Guidelines) and that, in this respect, it is essential to assess whether there is any tracking

profiling techniques.
The processing carried out by Clearview consists, as represented, in the collection of
images from the web (so-called web scraping) and their processing with automated tools in order to
create vectorial representations of faces and, subsequently, to hash them in order to index the data, an operation necessary to

declared by the company, to that carried out by any search engine, taking into account that the

to render them 'biometric data', which are moreover associated with information that is certainly capable of

The information notice published on Clearview's website indicates, in fact, that, in addition to the photographs
available to the public and available on the internet, also the information which can be extracted
from these photographs, such as the geolocation metadata they may contain,
as well as information derived from the analysis of the faces of the persons depicted and which, as such,
constitute, as said, biometric data on the basis of which the process of
is carried out.
But it is precisely this last step that constitutes the key to understanding the entire collection and processing process carried out by Clearview.
The purpose of this last step is the key to understanding the entire collection and processing process carried out by Clearview, which aims to create a data set to which the uploaded images can be compared.

of processing, which is also recognised in the European Regulation when, for the purposes of data
when, for the purposes of applying the targeting criterion, it refers to the circumstances in which "the

The assessment of this circumstance, together with the comparative purpose outlined above, is capable of constituting, as required by Recital 24,
an activity assimilated to the monitoring of the conduct of the data subject in that it is carried out
by means of internet tracking and subsequent profiling.
Contrary to Clearview's objections in its defence (see Memorandum No 33759 of
22/06/2021), the activity carried out by Clearview does not appear to be attributable to a mere classification
of individuals on the basis of known characteristics such as age, sex and height, since a further activity consisting in the

On the basis of the provisions of the 'Guidelines on automated decision-making relating to
individuals and profiling", adopted by the Committee for the Protection of Personal Data
on 3 October 2017 and amended on 6 February 2018, "the widespread availability of personal data on the
Internet and those obtainable from Internet of Things devices, coupled with the ability to find
correlations and make connections, can enable the determination, analysis and prediction of
aspects of a person's personality, behaviour, interests and habits." The
cited Guidelines identify three specific phases that characterise the activity of profiling, establishing that it must

These steps are certainly integrated into Clearview's processing, including,

with the biometric comparison activity - carried out following the execution of a search by the user - and with the

from any further evaluation activity that may be carried out by the end user on the basis of the
results of the consultation and which, although related to the former in the sense required by Art. 3.2.b,
is not superimposable on it, as the company argues in its defence.
The overall assessment of the circumstances set out above leads to the conclusion that the following conditions are satisfied
for the applicability of Article 3(2) of the Regulation and of the rules contained therein in the light of which
the processing of personal data of Italian data subjects carried out by Clearview must therefore be assessed
by Clearview (see on this point also the decision of the German supervisory authority of the Land of Hamburg

The processing carried out by Clearview qualifies as cross-border processing of personal data within the meaning of

November 2021 issuing an order to comply to the company CLEARVIEW AI).
3.4 EXISTENCE OF PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING AND GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE LAWFULNESS THEREOF
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE LAWFULNESS OF THE PROCESSING
It should first be noted that a photographic image constitutes "personal data" within the meaning of Article 4(1)(1),
of the Regulation, 'personal data' in so far as it enables a natural person (data subject) to be identified.
person (data subject). The same provision specifies that an identifiable person is 'a person who
can be identified, directly or indirectly, with particular reference to \[...\] one or more
characteristic elements of his physical identity'. On the subject of photographic images, the
the Court of Justice of the European Union has intervened specifically on the subject of photographic images, stating that "the image of a
image of a person recorded by a camera constitutes personal data within the meaning of the provision
mentioned in the previous point \[Art. 2.a of Directive 95/46, ed.
makes it possible to identify the person concerned" (see judgment of 11 December 2014, Case C-212/13,
para. 22).
Personal data obtained by specific technical processing relating to the physical,
physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person which allow or confirm their
unambiguous identification, such as facial image, are defined as 'biometric data' within the meaning of Art,
Article 4(1)(14) of the Regulation and, as such, are subject to the system of greater protection provided by Article 9 of the Regulation.
9 of the Regulation.
The difference between the two types of data is well defined by recital 51 of the Regulation,
according to which 'the processing of photographs should not systematically constitute the processing of
of special categories of personal data, since they fall within the definition of biometric data
only when they will be processed by means of a specific technical device enabling
identification or authentication of a natural person'.
As regards the concept of 'processing', it should be noted that it is defined by Article 4(1)(2) of the Regulation as 'any operation for the processing of personal data'.
2) of the Regulation 'any operation or set of operations \[...\] which is performed upon personal data the
sets of personal data, such as collecting, recording, organising, structuring, storing, adapting or amending
storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination
by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, comparison or
interconnection, restriction, erasure or destruction'.
As set out in section 3.1, the investigation has shown that Clearview has created a database of more than
database of more than 10 billion facial images, which are collected on the Internet through web scraping techniques and
web scraping techniques, are subjected to a biometric processing process with subsequent hashing
for indexing and search purposes, by making the database available to third parties.
third parties.
Given that the data in question are classifiable as common and biometric data, it is necessary to analyse
whether the activity carried out by the Company can be qualified as processing within the meaning and for the
effects of the Regulation.
In this regard, it seems first of all necessary to recall that the public availability of data on the
Internet does not imply, by the mere fact of their public status, the legitimacy of their collection by third parties.

Also the so-called OSINT techniques (open-source intelligence) which consist in the collection and
and processing of information, including personal data, from freely available sources, such as the Internet and
information, including personal data, from freely available sources, such as the Internet and public data, can only be carried out on an appropriate legal basis, as
recently clarified by the European Data Protection Supervisor with reference to
the aforementioned activity carried out by Europol (see EDPS Opinion on the possibility to use
Clearview AI and similar services at Europol (Case 2020-0372)).
Similarly, it should be noted that the publication of personal data on the Internet by the individual

a sufficient condition to legitimise their free re-use by third parties. If,
Indeed, if it is true that the Regulation (and, therefore, in this case, the principle of purpose under Art. 5,
par. 1(b) of the Regulation) does not apply to the processing of personal data carried out by a
a natural person for the exercise of activities of an exclusively personal or domestic nature (so-called household exemption, referred to in Art. 5(1)(b) of the Regulation).
household exemption, referred to in Art. 2(2)(c) of the Regulation), also with reference to
online activities, it is also true that the exemption must be interpreted restrictively. As stated by the
As stated by the Court of Justice of the European Union, the exemption 'covers only activities which fall within the
the private or family life of individuals, which is manifestly not the case with the processing of personal data consisting in their processing on the Internet.
which is clearly not the case with the processing of personal data consisting in their publication on the internet in such a way as to make them accessible to an indefinite number.

101/01, par. 47). It must therefore be held that the publication of personal data by the data subject on social networks is also bound by the obligation to publish them.
the data subject on social networks is also subject to the mere purpose for which the data subject intended to
(e.g. visibility within a particular social network for the sole purposes of the use of that SNS).
purposes underlying the use of that SNS).
The correctness of the thesis is supported by the Article 29 Working Party, which clarified "that,
even if personal data have been made accessible to the public, they continue to be regarded as such
and, consequently, appropriate safeguards continue to be required for their processing' (see
Opinion 6/2014 - WP217) and, more recently, by the Committee for the Protection of Personal Data, which
which has established that 'any communication of personal data constitutes a specific
processing for which the controller must have a legal basis among those referred to in Article 6", that
'the transmission of films to third parties for purposes other than those for which the data were collected is
purposes for which the data were collected is possible under Article 6(4)' and, finally, that 'the receiving third party will have to carry out its own legal analysis, in particular by identifying
its own legal analysis, in particular by identifying the legal basis of its processing under Article 6' (cf.
accordance with Article 6" (see Guidelines 3/2019 on the processing of personal data by means of
video devices, version 2.0, 29 January 2020).
As regards, in particular, data scraping, this is a particular mode of collection which takes place
completely without the knowledge of the data subjects.
As mentioned above, the possible public nature of the images is not sufficient for the data subject to reasonably expect them to be used.

In addition, web scraping activities are almost always prohibited by social networking service providers through explicit clauses.

This is so much so that, in the present case, press reports have shown that some of the major providers of such services (Twitter, Youtube, LinkedIn) have

On the basis of the above, it can reasonably be concluded that the collection of personal data
freely available on the Internet by means of web scraping techniques constitutes processing of personal data, which must be

Regulation.
If we wish to transpose this principle to the present case, we consider that the activity of web scraping of
of images carried out by the Company constitutes the collection of personal data, which
constitutes the processing of personal data.
In the present case, however, the Company does not limit itself to collect images from the Internet, given that,

According to Article 6 of the Regulation, the processing of personal data is lawful if, and to the extent that,

3.6.5. ARTICLE 27 OF THE REGULATION
Article 27 of the Regulation provides that, where Article 3(2) applies, the data controller is required to

3.6.6. ARTICLE 22 OF THE REGULATION
In the notice of initiation of the procedure pursuant to Article 166 of the Code notified on 22 April 2021

From this point of view, it is therefore considered that there are no grounds for considering that there has been a

As regards the seriousness of the infringements, it is noted that Clearview has violated Articles 6 and 9 of the
Articles 6 and 9 of the Regulation, which are the conditions of lawfulness and thus the fundamental requirements for the
processing within the meaning of the Regulation. An unlawful processing of biometric data for the purpose of

not only has the unlawful processing continued despite the intervention of numerous data protection authorities (European and

denial of European, and in particular Italian, jurisdiction.
