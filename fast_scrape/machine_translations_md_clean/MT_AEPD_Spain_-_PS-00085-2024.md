## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject submitted a complaint against the data controller, a legal entity representing the community of residents, for sharing with all members of the community a document with individualized heating consumption. Since the information would identify the number of each house, it was considered that the document held personal data. The Spanish DPA, then, proposed an agreement with the data controller for the payment of a reduced amount of the foreseen fine, considering the likelihood of the data breach.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA finalized an agreement with the data controller after the start of an investigation of a probable infraction to [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR"). The alleged and possible GDPR breach was connected to the controller message sent to all community residents with individualized information about their heating consumption. Since this information is considered personal data, it could be understood as an illegal sharing of personal information.

OWNERS R.R.R. (hereinafter, the claimed party), through the Agreement that

is transcribed:

<<

File No.: EXP202304214

            AGREEMENT TO START SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and in
based on the following

                                      FACTS

FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complaining party) dated September 15,
2023 filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
The claim is directed against COMMUNITY OF R.R.R. OWNERS. with NIF
\*\*\*NIF.1 (hereinafter, the claimed part). The grounds on which the claim is based
are the following:

Complaints for having sent all community members an email, on the occasion
of the next owners meeting, where a list of consumption is attached
Individualized heating month by month, identified by floor and letter.

A copy of the list received is provided along with the claim.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the claimed party, to

to proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency within a period of one month, of the
actions carried out to adapt to the requirements provided for in the regulations of
Data Protection.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/9

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the rules established in Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of Administrations
Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on 04/11/2023 as stated in the

acknowledgment of receipt that appears in the file.

On 04/27/2023, this Agency received a written response indicating between
other things the following:

“…in 2019 and following the installation of heating cost allocators,

Several owners requested the sending of the list of consumption, in order to
justify and prove the reduction in costs after it, due to the continuous
complaints from several neighbors about it.
With this list it was justified and proven that in most of the
housing was paid the same or less than previously to delivery drivers

costs…

One of the assumptions contemplated by the General Data Protection Regulation
that legitimizes the processing of personal data is the satisfaction of the legitimate interest
alleged by the person responsible or a third party. We believe that this interest would be applied in
this assumption by announcing the savings that the installation of delivery drivers

costs it has meant for the owners.”

THIRD: On 08/22/2023, the proceedings were filed since,
of the actions carried out and the documentation in the file, it is not
inferred the existence of an infringing action by the claimed party in the area

jurisdiction of the AEPD, so the claim was filed.

FOURTH: On 09/05/2023, the complaining party requested a copy of the file that
It was sent on 09/06/2023.

FIFTH: On 09/15/2023, the claimant filed an appeal for reconsideration
in which he alleges that an error has occurred in the legal classification of the facts
reported, that there has been an absence of investigative activity on the part of the AEPD,
that individualized energy consumption data for each supply point
may be considered personal data insofar as it refers to a
identifiable person, that the data protection regulations have been breached in their

articles 14, 6.4 and 21 among others of the RGPD. Requests the annulment of the resolution of
file and that an investigative phase be opened, that a correct qualification be made
legal nature of the reported facts, that the illegality of the actions of the
claimed party and that the repetition of the reported treatment in the future is prohibited.

SIXTH: On 01/03/2024 and in accordance with the provisions of article 118 of
the LPACAP, the requested party was granted a hearing procedure, attaching the
documentation provided by the appellant, so that, within a maximum period of ten
business days, will formulate the allegations and present the documents and supporting documents that
deemed appropriate.

The transfer of the hearing procedure, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations
established in the LPACAP, was collected on 01/12/2024 as stated in the
acknowledgment of receipt that appears in the file.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/9

On 01/19/2024, this Agency received a response letter indicating between
other things the following:

“Agree with the resolution of the AEPD, which supports and legitimizes the
sending a list, the object of this appeal, made by the Community of
Owners Paseo de Yeserías 33, due to the request of several owners, including
the vice president, due to the continuous complaints that there were after the installation of the
heating cost allocators. With this list it was justified and remained

proven that in the majority of the homes they paid the same or less than with
prior to the cost allocators. We emphasize that sending the listing
"It only had the purpose of satisfying the legitimate interest alleged by the person responsible."

SEVENTH: On 02/08/2024, the appeal for reconsideration filed by

A.A.A. against the resolution of this Agency issued on August 22, 2023,
which agreed to file the claim referred to the COMMUNITY OF
R.R.R. OWNERS, in order for the processing to continue.

proceedings.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                           Yo

                                     Competence

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the

LOPDGDD, is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions

regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

                                           II
                                 Previous issues

Analyzing the issue, STS 2484/2019 of the Contentious-Administrative Chamber
(SAN 1711/2018) establishes in its Third Legal Foundation in fine that: “\[…\]
We estimate that the measurements referring to the individual consumption of electrical energy
associated with each supply point and its code, which the distribution companies
are obliged to send to the system operator, as soon as they contain information
concerning the behavioral habits of an identifiable natural person, are data

personal (art. 2.a) of Directive 95/46/EC and art. 3.a) of the Organic Law of
Data Protection 15/1999, of December 13), and, as such, are
protected by the guarantees established by data protection regulations.”
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/9

Therefore, extrapolating to the energy consumption of each resident, it should be noted that
These data are protected by data protection regulations.

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 and 4.2 of the RGPD,
involves the processing of personal data, since the party

claimed carries out the collection, registration, organization and conservation of, among others,
the following personal data of natural persons: name, identification number
and location data, among other treatments.

The claimed party carries out this activity in its capacity as responsible for the

treatment, given that it is the one who determines the purposes and means of such activity, by virtue
of article 4.7 of the GDPR.

Article 4 section 12 of the GDPR broadly defines “violations of
security of personal data” as “all those security violations
that cause accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data

personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data.”

                                           III
                       Principle of integrity and confidentiality

Article 5.1.f) “Principles relating to processing” of the GDPR establishes:

"1. The personal data will be:

(…)

f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate data security
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures
or organizational arrangements (“integrity and confidentiality”).”

In the present case, it is clear that the personal data of the complaining party,

considering gas consumption as personal data (as has been
argued in the previous foundation), have been unduly exposed to all
the community members, since they have been sent by email as a report, previously
to the holding of the Meeting, which shows the month-by-month heating consumption
individualized, through the floor/door indicator, of each and every one of the
neighbors, resulting in a loss of confidentiality.

In accordance with the evidence available in this agreement of
initiation of the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered that the known facts could constitute a
infringement, attributable to the claimed party, due to violation of article 5.1.f) of the
GDPR.

                                            IV
                Classification of the violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD

If confirmed, the aforementioned violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD could mean the
commission of the infractions classified in article 83.5 of the RGPD that under the
The section “General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

“Infractions of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the

paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20 000 000 or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:
a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 “Infringements considered very
“serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that involve
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the

following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

           Proposed sanction for violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount,
in accordance with the evidence currently available
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the

instruction, it is considered that the balance of the circumstances contemplated in the
article 83.2 of the RGPD and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed
By violating the provisions of article 5.1.f of the RGPD, it allows initially setting a
fine of €600 (six hundred euros).

                                  Adoption of measures

If the violation is confirmed, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d)
of the RGPD, according to which each supervisory authority may “order the person responsible or
processor that the processing operations comply with the

provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, in a certain manner
and within a specified period…”, in the resolution that is adopted, it may be

It is warned that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by
This body in the sanctioning resolution may be considered as a

administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD, classified as
infringement in its article 83.5 and 83.6, and such conduct may be motivated by the opening of a
subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.
