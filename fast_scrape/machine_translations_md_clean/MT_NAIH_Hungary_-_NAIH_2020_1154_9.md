The identity of the ApplicantsThe lack of public role of the Applicants was also repeatedly invoked by the Applicants in the proceedingsin their statements and correspondence with the Applicant.3145/2018. (V. 7.), the Constitutional Court emphasized that the change had taken placeexpansion of the range of public actors through the spread of social conditions, especially telecommunicationsso that people have the opportunity to become active participants in public debates,who were not previously included in the conceptual scope of public actors. These persons are the so-called. exceptionalpublic actors. {3145/2018 (V. 7.) Decision AB Justification \[46\]}Freedom of expression is primarily concerned with criticizing public authoritiesexpresses opinions, but in the interpretation of the Constitutional Court it is publicthe range of issues is wider than political speech and persons exercising public powercriticizing its activities. Accordingly, the public debate is not limited to the state andit covers the whole operation of the local government, the system of public authorities, but also encompasses itin the world of corporate social responsibility and businesspublic issues (eg environmental, energy efficiency, labor, etc.)road safety issues). {3145/2018 (V. 7.) AB Decision Justification \[31\] - \[32\]}According to the decision of the Constitutional Court, in deciding the quality of a public figure, the followingaspects are relevant:
Page 32
32- whether the public statement expressing the opinion reflects the position expressed in the public interest debate,- whether the public communication involves a public performance,- whether the communication to the public involves a statement of fact or a judgment of value,- whether the communication to the public infringes the human dignity or reputation of the person concerned(honor).Public actor quality is the fact of public involvement that goes hand in hand with the discussion of public life issueswhich, according to AB, must always be assessed individually on the basis of the specified criteria:the manner and circumstances of the communication and the subject and context of the opinion (eg the medium)type, subject of communication, content, style, purpose, topicality, reactions to it).The exercise of freedom of expression can only be justified in cases wherein which the participants have become, at their own discretion, more active actors in public affairs than others,thereby also undertaking public assessments and criticisms of the community concerned. Public affairstherefore, statements which affect or characterize them and which attack themthey have to put up with more patience. { 3145/2018 (V. 7.) Decision AB Justification \[48\]}The Applicants emphasized that they had always wanted to separate their private lives frommarket life, and although the establishment of a business is voluntary, this does not in itself mean thatbusiness owners, senior executives become public actors, andthat someone is rich is not necessarily a sufficient condition for restricting privacy, that israther, it is only one component of influence.However, in the case of the Applicants, the fact that the \[…\]in a few years - from state subsidies and from state or other public fundsresources - has become a market leader in several countries. Applicants must counthad to be a successful, high-wealth company in the case of the business world as a public life onethey also become active shapers of its segment, undertaking the accompanying evaluations and criticismswhich they thus have to endure with greater patience.In connection with the present case, it can also be stated that one of the content elements of the examined communications is the Applicantsname and managing position, ownership position shall be considered as public data in the public interestdue to:- The Ctv. Pursuant to Section 10 (2), the existing or deleted data of the register of companies are in fullare public. Thus, the data contained in company files, including personal data,which, during registration in the register of companies, the purpose of the register of companiesaccordingly, data subjects provide their personal data with a view to disclosureaccessible to anyone. Existing or deleted data in the register of companies, as well aspersonal data contained in company records are public data in the public interest which are personaldata and also public data in the public interest.- On the mandatory content of the register of companies, the Ctv. Section 24 (1), as well as limited liabilitycompanies such as \[…\] - Ctv. Section 27 (3) provides. The referencedlegislation stipulates that the register of companies for all companies, inter alia,contains the name of the company's senior executive or the person authorized to represent the company,the position of the persons entitled to represent and, in the case of a limited liability company,among other things, the names of the members or, in the case of a jointly owned share, the owners.- The publicity of the data included in the register of companies is regulated by Ctv. according to its preamblepurposes and the legislator considered that this interest outweighed the data subjectsinterests.It should also be noted that the information provided in the publications on \[…\] is on the one handcan be found in \[…\] 's own accounts and website, and on the other hand, that \[\] publichas implemented and is implementing various expansions, capacity enhancements,

Legality of data processingThe subject matter of the present case is not usually the data protection analysis of economic journalism, and although the nature of the caseand circumstances, the Authority also makes general findings to emphasize that it is presentIn this procedure, the Authority is linked to specific publications ("products") issued by the Applicantexamined data treatments.Under the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, there are a number of reasons for the lawfulness of data processingrequirement must be met.Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation contains the main principles that are personalmust be taken into account in the processing of the data and which must be in force at all timesduring data management. Such principles include legality, due process and transparency,the principles of purpose limitation, data saving, accuracy and limited storage \[5. Article 1paragraph 1 (a) to (e)\]. From the principle of accountability \[5. Article 2 (2)\]is responsible for complying with data protection principles and must be able to do soalso to prove. Accordingly, the data controller must be able to prove that it is personalthe purpose for which it processes the data and why it can be considered for that purposeit is imperative to process your personal information, in addition, you must do everythingreasonable steps to ensure that it is inaccurate for the purposes of the processingdelete or rectify personal data without delay and document andkeep records of data processing so that its lawfulness can be proved afterwards.The controller must have a legal basis in accordance with Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulationhave access to the data and be able to demonstrate that, with the consent of the data subject, orwhich legal provision it handles / has handled personal data in accordance with or whichdata processing is necessary to enforce the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party,and the processing restricts the data subject's right to the protection of the personal data proportionately.The name and financial situation of the Applicants are undoubtedly personal to the Applicantshowever, their activities in relation to the company in which they have an interesthaving regard to the fact that their data entered in the business register are public data in the public interest, as well asa Ctv. Company data pursuant to Section 10 (1).Of course, the quality of the company data in the data in question does not mean that the data in the company registercould be used in any way: respecting the principle of purposeful data managementappropriate legal basis, and - ensuring the right to information self-determinationwith due regard for the rights of the data subject.According to the Applicant's statement, the purpose of data processing is the rights arising from the freedom of the pressinformation activities of the press in a democratic societyimplement. The Applicant also aims to inform the Hungarian business community, aabout the owners behind the largest Hungarian-owned companies, thus contributing to businesstransparency and traceability. The Applicant also considers it his responsibility to be Hungarianstrengthening the entrepreneurial culture by reporting on the activities of successful Hungarian entrepreneurs- the compilation of the annual rich list partly serves this purpose.In the publications, the Applicant linked \[…\] to the “\[…\] family”. The Authority considers thatin the context of publications, the word ‘family’ is synonymous with family businessshould be interpreted, and although there is no legal definition of a family business in Hungary,according to professional interpretation, regardless of their size and results, it is a family-run economy
Page 34
34companies, ie family businesses, are companiesmajority controlled by a family or families with common ancestors,in the hands of family members is concentrated so that control is at least two, owner and / or managerthrough the strategic and / or operational activities and decisions of the employed family member.Of the Applicants, only \[…\] were named for Data Management 2, and although Data Management 1it has been indicated that the \[…\] generation of the family has an interest in the economic activity,publications never name other family members, either specifically or indirectlyreferring to them. From the information in the company register, it is clear that the \[…\] familywhich members belong to this staff group.Consequently, the Applicants' view that the "\[…\] family" is not valid is incorrect.it would be inaccurate personal data because it applies to all family members, including minor childrencontains a reference. Neither the printed nor the online versions of the lists contain any direct or indirectreference to minor children, i.e. the Applicant does not treat the family as a minorand information on minor family members in the register of companieslocated. Consequently, minor members of the \[…\] family cannot be considered Data Management 1 andData management for 2 stakeholders.It should also be noted that Forbes is an economic, business articles and articlesa press product containing compilations, so that the Authority considers it accessible to anyonerecords and data forming part of companies' own public communications and accounts; andthe communication and dissemination of information in different compilations does not violate the purposeprinciple of data management.It should also be emphasized that assets derived from economic activities orEstimating the value of a company using a specific method is clearly afreedom of expression. The Applicant's estimate is different from the publiccollected data from different sources and then this data into a specificevaluated on the basis of a methodology.For Data Management 1, the following methodologies can be found in both the printed and online versionsdescription:“We took as families the companies where the ownership circle and the leaderthere is a blood relationship between the members of the management (i.e. owned by the spouses)companies, if no other relative is a member of the management, were not taken into account). The companiesevaluated based on the American Forbes methodology. Where possible, on an EBITDA basiswe calculated, this is best suited to show the money-making capacity of firms.We used industry multipliers and then deducted the company's liabilities from the value thus obtained,and we added your cash stock.In all cases, we worked from publicly available information, where possible, on a consolidated basisdata were used where such were not available, we ourselves consolidated theresults on the basis of available information. The Bisnode PartnerControl collections helped theConcorde MB Partners advised us on the company evaluation. ”For Data Management 2, the following methodological descriptions can be found in the printed and online versions:“We evaluated the companies based on the methodology of our American parent company. Where we knew it isWe calculated on the basis of EBITDA and took into account the court data. The internationalin accordance with company valuation practice, we used an industry multiplier. This is AswathWe used Damodaran, a professor at New York University, as a starting point, buttogether with our company valuation specialists and our regional sister sites, the multipliers for the region, respectivelywe tailored it to the Hungarian market, where it was necessary. The company was added to the value thus obtained

We always work from publicly available data.We have always used the most recent data available, for most non-public companiesthis means the financial statements submitted for the financial year from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018.For stocks, we have calculated the latest data. Closing of the property valuation: December 201910.Bisnode PartnerControl assisted us in collecting the data. The companiesWe were helped by the M&A experts of consulting companies. ”A similar methodological description is described in all similar Forbes publications (printed andonline version). In addition to the declarations and the AuthorityBased on the documents sent, it can be established that the Applicant is the current listsbut in all cases before the publication of the publicationsThe property and value valuation prepared for the Applicants on the basis of the methodology isor in relation to the business, in any case requesting feedback from them, and thatclarify the data if necessary. (Correspondence between the Applicants and the Applicantdetailed in III.4. presented in the context of the rights of the data subject.)Consequently, on the basis of the above, the Applicants' claim thatthey don’t know what logic Forbes journalists use to analyze the data.The Applicant did not specify the legal basis for data processing, although it did not specify itreferred to Article 6 (1) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulationindicated Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation. All this to the Applicanton the ground that, in its view, the activity carried out by the Applicant, namely theeconomic journalism and, within this framework, the richest and largest (orabove average) persons with social influence on a regular basis, publicly availabledata collection and a specific methodology for data and informationevaluation, interpretation and archiving of activities in the public interestthe \[…\] receive and have received significant state subsidies, which in itself justifies its citizens(the readership) the identity of the owner behind the investmentbe.The Applicant also referred to the Basic Law of Hungary - which is personal datain addition to the right to the protection of the public, the disclosure of data of public interest and the freedom of the press and thealso protects the diversity of the press - Article 10 of the Smtv, Article 85 of the General Data Protection Regulation,and decisions made by the Constitutional Court that are expressly made by the pressdata management and the exercise of freedom of the press, as well as the expression of opinionsborn in the context of his freedom.The Basic Law of Hungary provides for the right to the protection of personal data, freedom of the press and thealso names freedom of expression as a fundamental right, such as freedom of the press andfreedom of expression as a constitutional fundamental right to the enforcement of personal datamust be accompanied by the protection of the fundamental constitutional right toThe Constitutional Court ruled on the issues of media law 165/2011.

" \[ECR C-345/17. s.

The fact that the disclosure of this information is appropriatefor profit (also) does not preclude it from being carried out for journalistic purposesconsidered as an activity.The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has a wealth of case lawin developing the specific benchmarks that have been voiced in the debate on public affairslimitation of opinions. The practice of the ECtHR, however, is alsomade it clear that opinions expressed in the context of public affairs were more protectedit is not limited to political debates and politicians in the narrow sense. On the one hand, party politicsin addition to debates, it also protects the freedom to discuss other issues affecting the community with particular forcethe right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECtHR: Thorgeirsonv. Iceland, application number: 13778/88, paragraph 64, 1992, decision on the merits and satisfaction) .On the other hand, the ECtHR does not call only in cases where the public affairs dispute is outstandingimportant argument in which the disputed speech is addressed to politicians or officialsbut also if the public interest issue (also) concerns individuals. LatterIn this case, the tolerance threshold for individuals should also increase (ECtHR: Bladet Tromsø and Stensaasv. Norway, application number: 21980/93, 1999, decision on the merits and satisfaction) .Thus, in terms of the application of specific standards, it is not the person concerned per sestatus, but the public nature of the opinion.That is to say, it is not the case with free expression of opinion in public affairsthe significance of whether or not the person covered by the report is a professional public figurenor the question on which the speaker spoke and the communication in questioncontributes to public debate.Although the Applicants' role in business as well as public or other public fundsand the use of factual newspaper articles and reports related to themmay indeed be related to a public debate, the question arises as to whether this is by the Applicantcan also be said for published rich lists.The already mentioned “Markkinapörssi case” was also examined by the ECtHR { Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy andSatamedia Oy v Finland \[Grand Chamber\], 931/13. s. case, 27 June 2017}, whichrecalled in its decision the criteria of the case-law to which it was guidedshould serve the national authorities and the ECtHR itself when facing each otherthey consider freedom of expression and the right to privacy.When it comes to political speech or debate on a matter of public interest, there is littleit is possible to restrict the right to know and communicate information, “and that is a fundamental onelaw in a democratic society ’.Derogations from data protection rules for journalistic purposes allow journalists to:access and collect personal data in order to carry out their journalistic activitiesand deal with them, however, the ECtHR pointed out that the mere fact that
Page 38
38any information available to the public does not necessarily exclude it from Human RightsFrom the protection of Article 8 of the European Convention and to companies as a professional media industryactors had to be aware of the need for large-scale data collection and publicationthe exception rule exclusively for journalistic activities does not necessarily apply. TheThe rights protected by Articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights are reciprocalHowever, with regard to the weighting of documents, the ECtHR has pointed out, on the one hand, thatfree access to information) can indeed help to address issues of public interestdemocratic debate, however, found that the raw data without any analysis, largethere was no public interest in publishing it in the crowd. Taxation data acurious members of the public could allow individuals based on their economic situationcategorization of the privacy of othersdesire for information, which should not be seen as promoting a debate on an issue of public interest.The ECtHR has also transposed the case law of the ECtHR into EU law in the already mentioned ‘Buivids case’ :in that regard, it is clear from that case-law that it is intended to respect privacyin order to strike a balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of expressionThe European Court of Human Rights has developed the relevant criteria to be taken into account, inter aliathe contribution to the public interest debate, the awareness of the data subject, the subject of the report, the data subjectpast conduct, content, form and consequences of disclosure, informationthe manner and circumstances of obtaining the information and their appropriateness (see in this sense:ECtHR, 27 June 2017, Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland,CE: ECHR: 2017: 0627JUD000093113, § 165). Similarly, it must be borne in mind thatthe controller may accept a reduction in the scope of the invasion of privacyenabling measures.

" {IV / 1368/2018. ABDecision, Justification \[61\]; IV / 316/2019. Decision AB, Justification \[54\]}In view of the above, the Authority considers that there are no indications thatcompiling rich lists would be a “watchdog” type of activity and that specific public debatewould be related. These lists are published regularly (annually), not for specific eventsthey are related, but precisely to who and to what extent the given has been enrichedregardless of the source of the assets, the lists are based on a specific methodologyare compiled, not on the basis of who or which business received state aidsupport, so that the compilations also include persons and undertakings who, respectivelywhich did not receive state aid. As long as economic journalism can really‘Mission’, while the ‘rich list’ as a product is primarily not directly for public debatebut satisfies a ‘rumor hunger’, as it is not about concrete fact-finding, investigationit is about (which is typical of “watchdog” type journalism) but that the Candidate abased on publicly available information, estimated by businesses according to their own methodologyor, in the case of persons, assets derived from the activities of the undertakingthen ranks companies and individuals on the basis of estimated value or assets.Reference to business journalism as an activity of public interest Data management 1 andData management 2 cannot be accepted as a legal basis for data management either. The reason is that
Page 39
39the legal basis under Article 6 (1) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation is a piece of legislationmay be related to a data management activity related to a public task classified as such by the THEAlthough economic journalism is an activity in the public interest, it is not a public task (the General Data Protection Act)a public interest task in the wording of the Regulation), just as a journalist cannot be consideredto a person performing a public task \[cf. Section 459 (1) of Act C of 2012 on the Penal Codeparagraph 12\].Thus, in the case of Data Management 1 and Data Management 2, as well as similar “rich lists”, the Applicant does notperforms a task in the public interest, not least because these lists - by their nature andsince this is not their purpose either - they do not give a thorough picture of a dubious or perceived transaction.Journalism is not covered by Article 6 (1) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation itself.within the scope of the legal basis set out in This is borne out by Article 17 (3) (b)follows closely the terms also used in Article 6 (1) (e) \[or the Union legislatorin Article 17 (3) (b), it essentially merged what is already close to each otherPleas in law pursuant to Article 6 (1) (c) and (e)\]. Related to the expression of opinionhowever, the deletion of data cannot be avoided by this point but by Article 17 (3) (a)included.It follows that Data Management 1 and Data Management 2, similar “rich lists”,and, in general, all data processing related to business journalism, which is notArticle 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulationlegitimate interest may occur on a legal basis.In his statements made during the proceedings, the Applicant also referred to the legal basis of the legitimate interest.According to recital 47 of the General Data Protection Regulation, if the data processinglegal basis is a legitimate interest, it must be preceded by a balance of interestsit must specify, inter alia, the legitimate interest, the effect on the person concerned and whether:whether the processing is necessary or proportionate and whether it is a legitimate interest or notwhether the right of the data subject is superior.Thus, data processing based on a legitimate interest can only take place if the data controller has done so in advanceperforms the interest balancing test and, as a result of the test, the data controller or a third partylegitimate interests outweigh the possible disadvantages to the data subject through the processing.The balancing test is a three-step process in which thethe legitimate interest of the controller as well as the interest of the data subject as opposed to the weighting and the data subjectfundamental right, and finally, on the basis of the weighting, it must be determined whether it is personaldata. On this basis, it falls under Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulationreference may be appropriate and thus data processing may be lawful if itthe conclusion of the balancing test is that the controller or a third party has a legitimate interesttakes precedence over the data subject's legitimate interest in protecting his or her personal dataand the limitation of the rights of the data subject is proportionate to whether the controller or a third partywith a legitimate interest in the restriction.In doing so, the controller must consider, inter alia, that the data subject is concernedwhether it is a public actor (if so, this strengthens the data controller’s interest in data management) or thatwhether the journalistic activity in question is of an investigative nature (again, this only strengthens the data managementinterest) or only to satisfy a rumor hunger (in this case, personalstronger interest in data protection). Balance of interests is also successful if it isthis article is about public subsidies and otherwise public data in the public interest(e.g. company data).

Article 2 (2) (b)point\].In its statements made during the proceedings, the Applicant set out its position and arguments on its own andthe existence of a legitimate interest of a third party (the public) and thus the rights of the Applicants andhowever, this is not in line with the general data protection regulation (47).the requirements relating to the balancing of interests set out in recital THEThe applicant did not carry out the balance of interests properly and, as set out in Article III.4 of the Decision.is not explained in detail in point (a)information to the Applicants and only to the Applicants' legal representativeinformed the Applicants in its replies.In connection with the balance of interests, it should also be emphasized what a data management is likeand to what extent it may adversely affect a data subject cannot be generalized becausethe data subjects and their circumstances are different in each case, so this is a subjective value judgment,which means the same data management that one considers acceptable in one casedata subject, in another case another data subject may find it offensive.Freedom of information and the right to information self-determination must be taken into accountit must be taken into account whether the disclosure of the data does not disproportionately infringe thethe right to privacy.

Articles contain that the controlleras a minimum, which data processing conditions should be communicated to data subjects, depending on whethercollects personal data from data subjects or has not obtained it from data subjects. Given thatthat the Applicant did not use the data used to compile the lists directly from the Applicantscollected, but also in various public databases, reports and \[…\] publicused the information contained in its communications, the Applicant's preliminaryArticle 14 of the General Data Protection Regulationcontained shall apply. Consequently, Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation , whichcontains the minimum information that the controller must inform the data subject if thecollects personal data from data subjects - in this case it is not relevant and thereforeNor can the alleged infringement be established.The publications examined during the procedure (Data Management 1 and Data Management 2) can be said to be becausethey are periodically published on the one hand, and the methodology applied by the Applicant on the otheryou can determine exactly who you want to include in the current list,publication - that is, it practically implements profiling - the Requested general data protectionobligation under this Regulation to provide prior information for this limited number of staffprovide information covering Article 14 (1) to (2) of the General Data Protection Regulationwith particular attention to them- the purpose and legal basis of the processing,- the categories of personal data concerned,- data processing based on Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulationthe legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party,- the data subject's rights (rectification, erasure, restriction of data processing, protest),- the data subject's right to complain,- the source of the personal data and that the data are from publicly available sourcesdo they come from- the importance of profiling and for stakeholdersmay have consequences.Although it can be stated that before the lists appear, the Applicant (through his journalists) alwayscontacted the Applicants and informed them that the Applicant intended to be includedthem on that list and sent them a brief description of the methodology used andan excel spreadsheet containing a value or asset estimate based on a methodology, and

45provided the Applicants with comments and, if necessary, commentsto clarify the data, the Applicant did not properly comply with the prior informationas it did not provide information on the purpose and legal basis of the data processing, thethe legitimate interest of the controller or third party and the outcome of the balance of interests, profilingthe expected consequences, all the rights of the Applicants concerned and the Applicantsthe right to complain.As the Applicant did not provide adequate prior information to the Applicants, the Authorityfinds that the Applicant has infringed Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation.According to recital 60 of the General Data Protection Regulation, transparent and athe principle of fair data management requires that the data subject be informed of the data processingand information that is fair and transparentnecessary to ensure the processing of personal data, taking into account the specific nature of the processing of personal datacircumstances and context.The legal predecessor of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter "the Board"), Article 29 of Directive 95/46 / ECadopted by the Data Protection Working Party established by the General Data Protection RegulationWP260 on Transparency, which facilitates the application and interpretation ofmaintained by the EDPS after the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation- available to data subjects in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of the General Data Protection Regulationas set out in the Annex on the information to be providedinformation should make it clear that they may receive information on request at their discretioninvestigation. This is essential for effective transparency when involvedthey have doubts as to whether the discretionary test was fair or ifthey wish to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. "As the Applicant did not properly comply with this requirement, the Authority concludes that:the Applicant has infringed Article 5 (1) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulationthe principle of transparency with regard to Data Management 1 and Data Management 2.Articles 13-14 of the General Data Protection Regulation. prior information pursuant to Article 15the information provided at the request of the data subject shall be distinguished. While 13-14. in accordance with Articleinformation is intended to provide the data subject with a general, comprehensive picture of his or her personal datauntil then, the purpose of the right of access under Article 15 is specifically toreceive information on the lawfulness of the processing of your personal datain order to establish and controlIn exercising the right of access, the controller shall be required to comply with Article 15 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.shall provide the data subject with the information referred to in The Applicantsin its replies to its requests for the exercise of its right of accessthe purpose of the data processing, the categories of personal data and the source of the data and the listsstaff involved in the preparation of the report, and provided information on how to make the estimaterequired data will be deleted after the list is completed. Data management 2in addition, the Applicant indicated the legal basis for the processing \[Article 6 of the General Data Protection RegulationParagraph 1 (f)\]. It can be determined that the Applicant has access to the Applicantsits replies to its requests for the exercise of its rights do not fully comply with theArticle 15 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as in his replies theon the expected consequences of profiling, on the rights of all stakeholders of the Applicants aIt did not provide information on the applicants' right to complain.As the Applicant's request to exercise the Applicants' right of accessdid not provide adequate information to the Applicants in this context, the Authorityfinds that the Applicant has infringed Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

46If the processing is in the public interest or in the legitimate interest of the controller or a third partydata subjects may object under Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulationagainst the processing of their personal data. In this case, the data controller does not provide personal dataunless the controller proves that the processing is so compellingjustified by legitimate reasons which take precedence over the interests, rights and interests of the data subjectfreedoms or which are for the purpose of bringing, exercising or enforcing legal claimsrelated to the protection ofAccording to Article 21 (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the controller is obliged to the data subjectsdraw their attention explicitly to their right to protest at the latest at the latestcontact and information on this clearly and everything elseshould be displayed separately from the information.Given that the first arising in relation to the Requested Data Management 1 and Data Management 2did not draw the attention of the Applicants to the protest to which they were entitledand did not present the relevant information clearly and everything elseseparate from the information, the Applicant did not comply with Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation(4).This is significant because, under Article 21 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, aAn applicant may at any time object to the processing of his personal data in accordance with Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.based on points (e) and (f) of paragraph 1, which, however, is only appropriatecan live in the knowledge of information. In this case, the result of the protest is not automatic, butdepends on the process of weighing up the interests, the controller shall, upon request, prove thatother coercive force arising on his side against the rights and freedoms of the data subjectinterests take precedence.If the data subject objects to the data processing - for example, a newspaper article containing his personal datapersonal data may not be further processed by the controller, unlessif the controller proves that the processing is justified by compelling legitimate reasonswhich take precedence over the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject. On thisconsideration of the interests and rights of the data subject exercising his or her right to objecton a case-by-case basis.From the correspondence between the Applicants and the Applicant, it can be stated that although the ApplicantsThe right to protest was also exercised with regard to Data Management 1 and Data Management 2, the specific reasons for this(namely information on the security situation of the Applicants and their families)For the exercise of the rights of the data subjects dated 30 August 2019 and 15 November 2019, respectivelythey were not indicated in their applications either, instead they referred to the Civil Code in general. and Mvtv.and that, in their view, the Applicants cannot be consideredto public actors. The position presented to the Applicants Authority that the September 2019The Forbes list drew the attention of criminal circles to the family, so it is unknown to the Applicantwas, so the Applicant was not - could not - be in possession of the information whichcould have carried out an individual balance of interests for the Applicants.The Authority notes in this regard that although the investigation is in business for a long timeApplicants and their families who are active and put their company in a market-leading position are the publicationswould have come within the scope of criminal circles as a result of its appearance, does not belong to the Authorityhowever, the Authority shares the position of thethat it was not substantiated that the actions of the criminals were (solely) the publication of the publicationwould be a consequence.In view of the above, the Authority concludes that the Applicant has not committed any infringement,when it did not carry out an individual balance of interests following the Applicants' protest. Nevertheless, thecircumstance raised by the Applicants (but not communicated to the Applicant) in connection with the protest
Page 47
47the data subject may be relevant for the subsequent data processing of the Applicant"Reason relating to one's own situation" and any "compelling legitimate reason"in connection with its consideration. However, to the Applicant after the protest is second, uniquebalance of interests can be properly performed, it is expected and necessary that the Applicants are adequateexplain in detail why, for what reason they object to the processing.It should be emphasized that these data are only an application for the exercise of the right to protestmay be handled and used for the purpose of assessing individual interests.The Applicant's replies to the Applicants' requests for the exercise of the rights concernedcontain data relating to the data processing objected to by the Applicantsin which it refers, inter alia, to the public interest nature of the data processing and to \[…\]subsidies from public or other public funds.However, in its replies to the Applicants, the Applicant did not specifically address theApplicants seek to exercise their right to protest and to restrict data processingnor did it provide information on the decision taken in relation to themit did not address the remedies available to the Applicants, i.e. to make a complaintthey may do so before the Authority or have recourse to the courts. For the exercise of the rights of the data subjectunder the General Data Protection Regulationmandatory information element is information on enforcement options. The circumstance thatthe Applicants approached the Applicant through a legal representative and that ForbesThe general data management information available on the website contains the methods of enforcement, noexempts the Applicant from providing the necessary information. Based on all this, the AuthorityFinds that the Applicant has infringed Article 12 (1) and (4) of the General Data Protection Regulationparagraph.Under the General Data Protection Regulation, data subjects have the right to be deleted (forgotten)However, the general data protection regulation also provides for exceptionsfor which this right cannot be exercised. This includes cases where it isdata management the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and informationnecessary for this purpose \[17. Article 3 (3) (a)\] or where the public interest so requiresthe need for data management \[17. Article 3 (3) (b) to (d)\] or where the processing takes placenecessary for the submission, enforcement and defense of legal claims \[Article 17 Article 3paragraph (e)\].Data related to the Applicants or the company in the interest of the ApplicantsTreatment by the applicant (including publication) is one of the exceptions which:the right of erasure (and the erasure of personal data) cannot be exercisedArticle 17 (3) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulationhaving regard to the fact that the processing of these data is subject to freedom of expressionand necessary to ensure the right to information.In the present case, therefore, Article 17 (3) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation createsbalance between the right of erasure and freedom of expression and the right to informationensuring freedom of the press, as well as listing onlineversion, also the freedom of the Internet.In view of the above, the part of the Applicants' application in which the Applicants request that theAuthority may order the restriction of data processing, the deletion of the personal data of the Applicants, and theThe Authority shall refuse to refuse the requested processing.

48III.5. Request for suspension of the requested procedureIn its statement issued at the invitation of the Authority, the Applicant Section 48 (1) (a)(referring to a preliminary ruling within the jurisdiction of the court) requested that the proceedings be stayedAuthority, given that there is a personal relationship between the Applicants and the Applicantthe processing of your data is subject to legal proceedings, in which case the court will make a decisionwhether the data processing carried out by the Applicant is lawful.The Authority waived the requested procedure due to the following:- In order to examine and decide on the lawfulness of data processing, the Infotv. Section 38 (2) - (2a)provide the Authority with explicit tasks and powers, the courtprocedure is not a preliminary issue that would be absolutely necessary to resolvefor an objective, fair decision of the Authority, and without which the decision of the Authoritywould be unfounded.- The Acre. makes it clear that in general - merely the Acre. according to its rules - there is no placesuspension on the grounds that the Authority is aware of anotherpending proceedings which may affect its proceedings, unless otherwise provided by lawprovision does not allow for suspension. The question referred is not the same asthat the decision of another body may “affect” the legal interpretation of the Authority.- Available under Article 79 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulationadministrative or non-judicial remedies, including with the supervisory authoritywithout prejudice to the right to complain under Article 77 , all parties concerned shall be effectiveshall be entitled to a judicial remedy if, in his opinion, his personal data are covered by this Regulationtheir rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of improper handling.- The Authority may not be a party to any proceedings suspending the proceedingsat the request of a client, but makes an ex officio decision.III.6. The applicants' application for interim measures and for the imposition of a fineThe Applicants' application for an interim measure was submitted by the Authority to the Ákr. Pursuant to Section 46 b)rejects it, given that it is a civil lawsuit running in parallel with the data protection authority proceedingsIn the proceedings, the Applicants' application for the same right had already been examined by \[ír\].The Authority rejects the Applicants' request for a data protection fine, as ethe application of a legal sanction does not directly affect the rights or legitimate interests of the Applicants,for them, such a decision of the Authority does not create a right or an obligation, and therefore does notAs regards the application of a sanction falling within the scope of the public interest,with regard to the imposition of fines, the Applicants do not qualify as customers in accordance with Ákr. Section 10 (1)pursuant to paragraph Furthermore, since the Acre. Does not comply with Section 35 (1) in this regardthere is no place to file an application, so this part of the petition cannot be interpreted as an application.III.7. Data management before May 25, 2018The Applicants also objected to the lawfulness of the data processing for the period before Data Management 1.During the procedure, it was established that in the period before Data Management 1, the Applicant onlyOn one occasion, in the August 2015 issue of Forbes, it included “\[…\]family ”in the“ Largest Hungarian Family Enterprises ”compilation.This part of the request therefore concerns data processing for which, before 25 May 2018,took place before the date of application of the General Data Protection Regulation, to which thethe rules of this Regulation shall not apply. In view of this, Ákr. Section 47 (1) (a)the Authority will terminate the procedure as this part of the application does not comply with Infotv. 60.§ (2), as the general data processing period is general
Page 49
49data protection regulation was not yet applicable. For this reason, in terms of privacyno application for an administrative procedure may be made or an examination of the Authority 's own motion; andnor does it initiate official proceedings.The circumstance is that the Applicant is also in the period from August 2015 to September 2019collected data on the company in the interest of the Applicantsfrom publicly available databases accessible to anyone or from \[…\] 's own public communications, andshall not be considered as unlawful data processing.III.8. Legal consequencesThe Authority granted the Applicants' request in part and Article 58 of the General Data Protection RegulationCondemns the Applicant under paragraph 2 (b) because Data Management 1 andHis activity in relation to Data Management 2 violated Article 5 of the General Data Protection RegulationArticle 5 (1) (a), Article 5 (2), Article 6 (1) (f), Article 12 (1) and (4)Article 14, Article 15 and Article 21 (4).Pursuant to Article 58 (2) (c) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Authority shall instruct:Within 15 days of the decision becoming final (ex post)fully comply with its obligation to provide information to Applicants, includingthe considerations taken into account in the balance of interests and the outcome of the balance of interestsinformation.The Authority also instructs pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) of the General Data Protection Regulationto shape the Applicant in accordance with the applicable legislation and the provisions of this decisiontransfer prior information practices as well as whether in the futurein the course of data processing, he intends to use the legitimate interest as a legal basis, then the lawcarry out a balance of interests in accordance with the provisions of this Decision,including a second, individual consideration of interests following the protest.The Authority's request to impose a data protection fine on the Applicants is set out in Section III.6. pointhowever, it examined of its own motion whether the infringements found had been establishedwhether it is justified to impose a data protection fine on the Applicant. In this context, the Authority isArticle 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and Infotv. 75 / A. § - the followingconsidered all the relevant circumstances of the case of its own motion and found that the present caseIn the case of infringements detected during the procedure, the warning is not in itself proportionate and dissuasivetherefore a fine is justified.By imposing a fine, the Authority’s specific deterrent objective is to encourage the Applicant toto carry out his / her data management activities consciously and not to the data subjects as objects and / ortreat it as an obstacle but as a genuine right holder, ensuring that their rights arising therefrom,information necessary to exercise control over the processing of their personal data, otherconditions. And it is usually required for all data controllers in a similar situationto make it clear that the processing of personal data requires increased awareness cannot benegligently trust that the data subjects will not be disadvantaged by personal dataactually uncontrolled treatment. Such conduct disregards the rights of those concernedleave and, as such, cannot go unpunished.The Authority considers that the practice, which is also present on the Hungarian market, according to which thevarious rich lists, publications listing the richest Hungarians, if enoughthey do not always include the name of the data subject and / or the data subjectbut in them, for example as a result of a well-founded protest by the data subject.instead of the full name, only one letter, and instead of an article describing the activity of the person concernedminimum information (eg name of the sector, amount of assets associated with the data subject)
Page 50
