## English Summary

### Facts

In 2018, the Luxembourg DPA (the CNPD) initiated 25 different audit proceedings both in the private and public sector with regard to the role of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) under Section 4 of Chapter 4 of the GDPR (see in particular [Article 37 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR") to [Article 39 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_39_GDPR "Article 39 GDPR")).

One of these audit proceedings concerned a not-for-profit association (Association Sans But Lucratif) established under Luxembourg law (hereafter, the ASBL). The ASBL is part of a confederation specialised in the provision of social services. In that context, the ASBL has established different partnerships with various entities providing social services in Luxembourg (the Patner Entities). The core activities of the ASBL is therefore not to provide social services, but rather to manage the funding of the Partner Entities, validate common strategies for the confederation, and determine which Partner Entities are responsible for their implementation.

During the audit, it was found by the head of investigation of the CNPD that the ASBL had appointed a DPO pursuant to [Article 37(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#1 "Article 37 GDPR"). No violation of the obligations relating to the role and position of the DPO was found. In the course of the proceedings, the CNPD questioned however the necessity for the ASBL to appoint a DPO in the first place. The CNPD therefore invited the head of investigation to get complementary information on that point. The head of investigation further communicated with the ASBL, and concluded that the latter was under the obligation to appoint a DPO.

### Holding

Based on the received complementary information, the CNPD decided _not_ to concur with the conclusion of the head of investigation. Taking into account the managerial role of the ASBL within the confederation, and in particular the fact that the ASBL itself was not processing health data for the provision of social services, the CNPD found that the ASBL had wrongfully concluded that it was under an obligation to appoint a DPO pursuant [Article 37(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#1 "Article 37 GDPR"). The CNPD further pointed out that the investigation should have covered the processing activities of the Partner Entities of the confederation.

Given the absence of any violation on the part of the ASBL, the CNPD decided to close the case.

## Comment

Even when the GDPR does not specifically require the appointment of a DPO pursuant to [Article 37(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#1 "Article 37 GDPR"), organisations may designate a DPO on a voluntary basis. Such practice is encouraged by the Article 29 Working Party (the predecessor of the EDPB). If a DPO is appointed on a voluntary basis however, the requirements under Articles 37 to 39 will apply. In this case, however, the CNPD did not analyse in details whether these requirements had been fulfilled by the ASBL, pointing that the investigation should have rather covered the activities of the Partner Entities providing the social services.

6. By letter of 28 October 2019 (hereinafter: the “statement of objections”), the Chief
investigation informed the inspector of breaches of obligations under the GDPR that it

noted during its investigation. The audit report was attached to the letter.

7. In particular, the head of the investigation noted in the statement of objections a
                                                       2
breach relating to the DPD's control mission.

8. By letter of November 18, 2019, the inspector sent the head of the investigation

complementary to the statement of objections by which he informs the inspectorate that,

given the position taken by the latter of November 18, 2019, "it is appropriate to lift the grievance

relating to compliance with the requirements relating to the missions of the DPO and in particular

control "and that" \[i\] t therefore no longer has any grievance against you
regarding this investigation. "

the National Commission sitting in a restricted formation (hereinafter: the "formation

restricted "), indicating that it has not accepted any grievance or breach against the inspected,
when the latter had met the expectations set in the survey or presented

elements of mitigation that it considers sufficient in relation to the control objectives adopted

in point 5 of this decision. For these reasons, the investigator proposed to the training

restricted, in its communication of December 7, 2020, the closure of the file.

              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

                       the survey n ° \[…\] carried out with the non-profit association A 3/711. The restricted committee examined the case during its session on February 5, 2021,

in accordance with Article 10.2.a) of the Rules of Procedure of the National Commission.

12. During the said session, the restricted committee considered that it was not sufficient

enlightened on the point of knowing whether the controlled, taking into account its structure, within which

several member entities are grouped together, and the predominance of said entities for

the management and exercise of its activities, is obliged to appoint a delegate to
data protection under Article 37 (1) of the General Regulation on

Data protection.

13. The restricted committee therefore asked the head of the investigation, by letter from

25 March 2021, to proceed, in accordance with Article 10.2.a) of the internal regulations of

the National Commission, to further investigation on this point.

14. By email of May 25, 2021, the head of the investigation asked the control of him

communicate additional information and documents, in particular concerning

activities of the inspectorate and its decision-making structure, in order to be able to inform the training

limited on whether the inspected is obliged to appoint a delegate
to data protection under Article 37 (1) of the General Regulation on

Data protection.

15. The inspected responded to this request by letter of June 15, 2021. The inspected there
indicates in particular that he carried out an analysis that led him to consider that he is in

the obligation to appoint a DPO and that this analysis has been updated

given the questions raised by the restricted committee in this regard.

16. Following this exchange, the head of the investigation informed the restricted party, by email from the

June 22, 2021, from its conclusion on the item for further investigation, according to

which the inspected is indeed subject to the obligation to appoint a DPO. The head of inquiry has by
elsewhere again proposed to the restricted committee to close the file, considering that it

There is no reason to hold any breach with regard to the inspected.

17. The restricted committee examined the case again at its meeting on October 27.
2021, in accordance with Article 10.2.a) of the Commission's Rules of Procedure

              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                      the survey n ° \[…\] carried out with the non-profit association A 4/718. Taking into account the elements communicated by the inspected within the framework of the supplement

investigation, the small group finds that it does not share the chief's conclusion
investigation according to which the inspected is indeed subject to the obligation to appoint a delegate to

Data protection.

19. It should first be noted that the inspected is an entity \[...\] "which brings together the
activities organized for its service provider members ”and that, as mentioned in

point 12 of this decision, these entities have a preponderant place for the management and

the exercise of its activities.

20. As for the activities of the inspected, the restricted formation notes that if the chief

investigation rightly noted in its email of June 22, 2021 that "\[t\] he core activities

\[of the controlled\] are \[to provide social services\] and that, as part of these activities, the
controlled processes data relating to health, the head of the investigation also noted

that “\[i\] n the framework of its basic activities, \[the controlled\] does not have any collaborators.

All the activities are carried out by another entity, member of the network \[of the controlled\], to

the account \[of the controlled\]. "

21. In this regard, it should be noted that in its response of 15 June 2021, the inspected

only identified a single "own operational activity", the other activities mentioned

being on the one hand "Operational activities delegated" to one of its member entities
and on the other hand, "Administrative and support activities" delegated to two entities

members.

22. With regard to the decision-making structure, the elements communicated by the
controlled confirm that its member entities, which sit in its Assembly

general, occupy a prominent place, it being specified "that an activity is recognized

as an activity \[of the controlled\] if it was set up by decision of the board
of directors ", this board of directors being" composed of at least \[...\] members and

of \[...\] members at most, taken from among the active members and elected by the general assembly

ordinary and annual ruling by a simple majority of the votes of the active members present. "

23. The inspected also indicates that this board of directors (hereinafter: CA) "is

responsible for the general management \[of the controlled\] and for the strategy of the network. Since \[the

              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                      the survey n ° \[...\] carried out with the non-profit association A 5/7 controlled\] has a very limited activity of its own, the Board of Directors focuses on agreements

    strategic between the partners forming the network. It validates common strategies

    proposed by the partners, determines where applicable their funding and the entity (ies)
    responsible for their operationalization. "

    24. Finally, the controlled indicates that it is "\[in\] summary (...) a confederation bringing together the

    members, actors and drivers of a common idea in order to determine common policies
    and organize their application at the level of field activities. Thus any daily management

    (also that \[of the controlled itself\]) is entrusted to operational entities, in

    occurrence to partners. "

    25. In view of the above, the restricted committee considers that it was not established by the

    further investigation that the controlled, namely the non-profit association A, was

    in the obligation to appoint a DPO.

26. In addition, taking into account the objectives defined by the CNPD within the framework of the

    thematic survey on the function of the DPO, and in particular the criteria used for

    selection of entities, the restricted committee considers that the investigation opened by deliberation
    No. \[…\] of September 14, 2018 should also have covered, given their activities and

    data processing, on other operational entities, members providing

    the non-profit association A.

    27. In these circumstances, the restricted committee considers that the case should be closed,

    in accordance with Article 10.2.a) of the Rules of Procedure of the National Commission.

    In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting in
    restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

    - to close the investigation opened by deliberation n ° \[...\] of September 14, 2018 of the

    National Commission for Data Protection with the Non-Profit Association

    A located at \[…\], L- \[…\] and registered in the Luxembourg trade and companies register
