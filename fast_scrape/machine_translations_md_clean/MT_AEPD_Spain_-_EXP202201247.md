## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject made a complaint against the data controller since their personal data was used for allowing the loan for their sister buying a car. The data subject affirms that their personal data were processed by the data controller with no consent and alleged that they were set as the guarantor of the buying without their knowledge. However, there was evidence proving that the data subject knew about the transaction and, as mentioned by the data controller, the data subject is actually the co-owner of the car in dispute, not its guarantor.

### Holding

The DPA ruled that processing the personal data of a subject who is the co-owner of the car bought via contract is legitimate, considering Article 6 of the GDPR. There is no need for consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data when they are part of a contract with the data controller. Since the data subject is a part of the co-owner of the car bought and does not act as a guarantor, the execution of a contract is a legitimate legal base for the processing of personal data. Thus, the DPA understood there was no breach of the GDPR.

requires payment not as guarantor but as co-owner. Specifically, it provides the
judicial claim for non-payment, in which both the claimant and the
