## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a company that called data subject with the request to partake in a survey. Data subject’s telephone number, however, was listed in an official “Do-not-call” registry. The controller stated that it did not know data subject’s name, and that they had a legitimate interest and thus their legal basis for processing was [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). Moreover, it claimed that, if the person would agree to partake in the survey, they would only further process the personal data with consent of the data subject. Finally, the controller claimed that data subject was called because of a human error, and it was not the intention to call someone whose number is listed in an official “Do-not-call” registry.

The data subject then filed a complaint with the DPA.

### Holding

First, the DPA considered that the data subject was not a user or client of the controller. Hence, the controller had to prove that it conducted a balancing test that showed that their legitimate interest overrode the data subject’s interests, rights and freedoms, pursuant to [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). In this regard, the DPA found that the data subject’s phone number was listed in a “Do-not-call” registry was the decisive factor that the data subject’s interests were not overridden. In this regard, it was not relevant that data subject was called because of a human error. If anything, the DPA notes, this showed that the controller did not take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure compliance with the principles listed in [Article 5 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). Hence, the DPA concluded that the controller did not have a legal basis to process data subject’s phone number, and violated [Article 5](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

Second, the DPA found that data subject was insufficiently informed about the processing of their personal data, and the controller thus also violated [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"). However, the DPA did not use any of their corrective powers as listed in [Article 58(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR").

Article 17 (1) of the General Regulation stipulates that the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the deletion of personal data relating to him without undue delay and that the controller has the obligation to delete personal data without undue delay if one of the following conditions is met: a) personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; (b) the respondent withdraws the consent on which the processing is based in accordance with Article 6 (1) (a) or Article 9 (2) (a) and if there is no other legal basis for the processing; (c) the respondent objects to the processing in accordance with Article 21 (1) and there are no compelling legitimate reasons for the processing, or the respondent objects to the processing in accordance with Article 21 (2); (d) personal data have been unlawfully processed; (e) personal data must be deleted in order to comply with a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject; (f) personal data have been collected in connection with the provision of information society services referred to in Article 8 (1).
Article 14 stipulates that if personal data relating to the data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with all of the following information at the time of collection: (a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, if applicable, (b) the contact details of the Data Protection Officer, if applicable if applicable, the intention of the controller to transfer personal data to the recipient in a third country or international organization and the existence or non-existence of a Commission decision on adequacy, or in the case of Article 46 transfers; 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49 (1), reference to appropriate or appropriate safeguards and the means of obtaining a copy thereof or the place where they are made available.

The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the said Act, inter alia, within a reasonable time after receiving personal data, and no later than one month taking into account the special circumstances of personal data processing. the moment personal information is first disclosed. Paragraph 4 of the same article stipulates that if the controller intends to further process personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were obtained, the controller shall provide the respondent with information on that other purpose and all other relevant information referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 14 of the General Regulation.
The respondent has the right, at any time based on his / her special situation, to object to the processing of personal data concerning him / her in accordance with Article 6 (1) (e) or (f), including the creation of a profile based on these provisions. . The controller may no longer process personal data unless the controller demonstrates that there are compelling legitimate reasons for the processing that go beyond the interests, rights and freedoms of the respondent or to set, exercise or defend legal claims. If personal data is processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the respondent has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data relating to him for the purposes of such marketing, which includes creating a profile to the extent associated with such direct marketing. At the latest at the time of the first communication with the respondent, the respondent must be explicitly drawn to the law referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and this must be done in a clear and separate manner from any other information (Article 21).
Consequently, based on the established facts in this administrative matter, company x as the controller did not have a legal basis for the processing of personal data, specifically the telephone number of the applicant. Namely, the allegation that the legal basis for the processing of the applicant's personal data is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (f). The General Data Protection Regulation does not have its legal basis in this particular case as it has not been established that the applicant is a user / client of the said manager. Also, the processing manager's call for a legitimate interest is not enough, but the processing manager must be able to prove it by conducting a balance test in which he proves that the processing manager's interest prevails over the interest or rights and freedoms of respondents. Also, the decisive fact in this administrative matter was the fact that the applicant's number was entered in the Register "Do not call" before contacting the company so that a legitimate interest can not be a valid legal basis in this case.
The mentioned company also did not prove that the number is in the telephone directory, and the fact that it admitted that calling the number in the Register "Do not call" was due to human error proves that the mentioned company as a processing manager does not take appropriate protection measures to process personal data was lawful and fair, in breach of the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation. 
In addition, it follows from the described procedure that the applicant was not adequately informed about the processing of personal data in the manner required by Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As the company in question processed the applicant's personal data without the legal basis of Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation without taking care that the number is in the Do Not Call Registry, the applicant's personal data was ordered deleted from its databases (storage systems). whereas, in accordance with Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation, there are no stronger legitimate reasons for the further processing of personal data and personal data are also unlawfully processed.

No appeal is allowed against this decision, but an administrative dispute may be initiated before the Administrative Court in Zagreb within 30 days from the day of delivery of the decision.
