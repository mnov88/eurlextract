## English Summary

### Facts

The DPA received a number of complaints from data subjects about Amplifon, a company selling hearing aids (the controller). The controller allegedly sent them a written letter via post inviting them to a free hearing test, despite the fact that they had not previously consented to receiving such marketing communication. The DPA therefore launched an ex officio investigation on 1 January 2020.

The controller claimed that letter assessing the need for hearing tests were only sent to persons listed in the database provided by the Ministry of Interior. On average, the controller requested data every 2-3 months, with an average of 3-400.000 data subjects' names and addresses per request. All data were transferred to a separate, secure server by the controller's competent employees, and the entire contents of the device were irretrievably deleted after the transfer. The purpose of the data collection – stated by the controller in the request to the Ministry – was to contact and maintain contacts for direct marketing purposes and, in subsequent requests (after 23 February 2021), for market research.

In the controller's view, Article 3(1)(d) of the Act CXIX of 1995 on the processing of name and address data for research and direct marketing allowed the collection of data from the sources specified in the legislation. Accordingly, the market researcher may request name and address data from the register of the Ministry of Interior for the purpose of contacting the data subject. Provided that the data subject had not refused the disclosure of his or her data.

The controller stated that it used consent of the data subjects as the legal basis, arguing that the data subjects had the possibility to withdraw their consent at the Ministry of Interior or the controller if they do not wish their personal data to be processed.

### Holding

First, in the DPA's view, the silence of the data subject could not be accepted as an affirmative act. If the data subject did not take any active steps to give consent, the controller cannot infer that the data subject consented to the processing. Consent is also closely linked to adequate prior information, i.e. that the data subject had adequate information about the circumstances of the processing before giving consent. The DPA found that this was clearly lacking in this case. Therefore, the DPA held that the controller violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") by unlawfully using consent as a legal basis.

Second, the DPA also found that, from 26 April 2019, the Act CXIX of 1995 on the processing of name and address data for research and direct marketing no longer covered requests or processing for the purpose of contacting for direct marketing. In other words, as of 26 April 2019, the legal authorisation for processing for direct marketing purposes ceased to exist. The controller nevertheless continued to process the requested data for the purpose.

The DPA noted that following the controller's request to the Ministry of Interior dated 23 February 2021, the purpose of the processing was “_to contact the public in the field of health promotion, including hearing and hearing loss_.” However, in its previous applications, the purpose was “_to inform the public about our hearing care services_.” Thus, from March 2021, the controller no longer requested the data for direct marketing, but for market research purposes. The use of the personal data was also solely authorised for this purpose by the Ministry of Interior. The DPA was of the opinion that the controller adjusted its request to the Ministry of Interior to market research purposes in order to comply with the changed legal requirements, only to continue its processing for direct marketing purposes. The DPA therefore found that the controller violated the purpose limitation principle under [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR"). It misled the data subjects and the Ministry of Interior by disguising the true purpose of the processing, thereby also violating the principle of fairness under [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR").

The DPA emphasized that since the controller contacted potential patients after collecting personal data not from the data subject but from another source, it should have provided the information to the data subjects within a reasonable time, taking into account [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"). In addition, the DPA found that the provided information sheet did not indicate the legal basis for the processing. Furthermore, it did not indicate the real purposes of the processing and the small font size of the notice made it inadequate. The DPA held that the controller had thereby violated [Article 14(1)](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR#1 "Article 14 GDPR") and [(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR#2 "Article 14 GDPR"). Because it failed to provide clear and transparent information, the controller also violated [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR").

The DPA imposed a €200,000 fine on the controller and ordered the controller to delete all data of the data subjects, i.e. all name and address data provided by the Ministry of Interior.

ii) The Obligor requests data every 2-3 months on average. In the Mandatory letter, in the form of a request addressed to the BM, only name and address information is requested for specific age groups. This means that it does not indicate a specific year of birth, but requests data for a period of time covering several years, with no claim to the date of birth, nor even year-level identification. BM provides the data to the Obligor on an electronic data carrier. The competent employees of the Obligor place all data from the data carrier on a separate server volume with a code, and then the entire content of the data carrier is irreversibly deleted.
iii) BM provides the data in tabular form, in a format that can be opened with the Excel program.
iv) Within the examined data management period - according to the attached application copies, between June 24, 2020 and August 4, 2021 - the Obligee applied to the BM 9 times with a request for data provision.

vi) The Obligee requests the name and address according to the year of birth (not time!), bearing in mind that the market research is aimed at the age groups affected by hearing loss.
vii) The Obligee is the Nytv. Pursuant to Section 19 (1) point c) of Nytv. You can request the provision of data according to point a) of § 17, paragraph (2), i.e. name, residential address and notification address data.
viii) According to the Obligor's current practice, the Kktv. Section 5 (1) and Infotv. Pursuant to § 20, it strives to provide adequate information and does everything to ensure the voluntary nature of data provision.
ix) Based on the Obliger's point of view, the legal basis for the inquiries is provided by Article 6 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation, i.e. the Obliger - according to its declaration - manages personal data based on voluntary consent and ensures the exercise of the rights of the data subject, so in particular that the data subject can withdraw the consent at any time.
In its response letter, the Obligee noted that "in the case of the market research purpose, it can be seen that the legislation already provides the possibility for the concerned party to indicate to the Ministry of the Interior that he does not wish to make his data available in relation to the specified purpose". According to the Obligor's point of view, the exercise of the data subject's rights is ensured by adequate information, so that the data subject can declare in the form of a statement or confirm unequivocally whether or not he consents to the further processing of the data, based on specific and appropriate information. Therefore, according to the Obligor's point of view, the data subject has the maximum possibility to make a statement to the BM or the Obligor if he does not wish to consent to the processing of his data, however, in the absence of this, the consent can be considered given by the data subject's behavior expressing that the request and thus the you consent to the processing of your data. Because - according to his point of view - the national practice also shows that the actual limit of data management in such cases is a clear declaration by the data subject that he no longer consents to data management.

The Obligor also submitted that it is not clear to him why his entire customer database, which also contains other personal data, which the Obligor manages on the basis of such data management activity, which, to the best of his knowledge, is not the subject of the present procedure, is relevant, therefore, in relation to the question, the Authority asked for clarification as to whether he is requesting a copy of the details of the register only in relation to the investigated data management (direct marketing) or in relation to all data.
In view of the fact that the Obligor did not send a copy of the requested database detail despite the Authority's request, the Authority issued NAIH-5802-6/2022 dated July 20, 2022. in his order no., he repeatedly requested the additional sending of the requested database within 3 days.
viii) At the request of the Authority to make a statement, supported by documents, that
 
13
what percentage of the sales revenue shown in the data for the 2020 report was made up of product sales to customers achieved through postal inquiries using BM data services, the Obligee stated that the records kept by the marketing department only show sales starting from June 1, 2020, because On June 1, 2020, they switched to a new system and such data stored by the previous system are no longer included in the new register.
According to the Obligor's records, the so-called In the case of "miniDM", i.e. persons contacted by mail for direct marketing purposes, a total of 1,045 hearing aids were sold after June 1, 2020, of which 599 were customers who came for a hearing test based on a postal request letter using BM data services, after which hearing aid for sale.
The Authority NAIH-5802-6/2022 dated July 20, 2022. in his order no., he repeatedly requested the fulfillment of this request by stating that if he does not have the requested information and data for the period between January 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020,
for the period after June 1, 2020 - with documents
supported - present the BM data services broken down by year
to customers reached by postal inquiry
product sales ratio, both the Obligor and the AMPLIFON group of companies
regarding.

NAIH-5802-6/2022 dated July 20, 2022 is the Obligor's Authority. received its order no. on August 5, 2022. In its reply dated August 8, 2022, the Obligor stated the following:
- The Obligee has sent its database excerpt from its entire customer database as of August 5, 2022, in relation to persons with the surname beginning with the last name indicated by the Authority.
The attached table contains 913 records, in which the Obligor maintains the following customer data: name, customer number, postal code, name and nature of public area, house number (building, stairwell, floor, door), main phone/mobile phone number, e-mail address , associated hearing center, date of birth.
In relation to the attached table, the Obligee submitted that it manages several databases depending on the legal basis, for what purpose and for how long. The Obligor basically stores the data in electronic form using the Microsoft Dynamics CRM software (hereinafter: CRM). The database registered in the CRM system is the most extensive, while in the case of data requested from the BM, the data of the affected parties are recorded in a separate Excel table (hereinafter: DM table). If a person applies for a hearing test after the postal inquiry, the person is removed from the DM table and transferred to the CRM system, because the contacted person becomes a potential customer who is open to being examined and buying a hearing aid. This is necessary so that if the person in question decides to take part in the hearing test and requests an appointment for this, he/she will be removed from the scope of data that the Obligee is entitled to handle for 6 months according to the law.
The DM table is therefore a separate independent table whose data is automatically deleted every 6 months. The table attached to the Authority does not include the data handled for direct marketing purposes, because they are handled by the Obligee in a completely different way (for a different purpose, with a different legal basis, different data, for a different period of time) than the data of customers who are already customers.
 
14
The Obligor repeatedly highlighted in his statement that he cannot attach a copy of the database detail of the persons with the indicated surname from his customer database as of the last day of the examined period, i.e. October 5, 2021, taking into account that those who appeared in the database provided by BM with such a surname beginning are your data has since been deleted, as the statutory 6-month period has expired.
- According to the Obligor's statement, he does not have any documentation and records with which he could give an exact percentage regarding the proportion of product sales to customers reached by postal inquiry using BM data services. The Obligee records all sales of hearing aids in a table, regardless of who bought them and under what influence, so no separate aspect is recorded in the table.
In the register, the Obligee only sees how many people participated in hearing tests and how many hearing aids were sold on an annual basis. What is the relationship between these, i.e. in what forum did the people who bought the sold hearing aids find out about it and as a result of the postal inquiry or other direct marketing activity (television and radio advertisements, internet advertisements, press products, postal inquiries, events, professional statements, etc.) were purchased from the Obligation as a result, you have no information.
A significant part of the Obligor's sales revenue comes from the sale of the device, however, there is no data available regarding who bought a hearing aid, where they learned about its possibility, and whether those who went for a hearing test bought a hearing aid.
According to the Obligor's statement, direct marketing mail inquiries account for approximately 5-10% of the total sales, however, since these data must be deleted every 6 months according to the law, the Obligor is not in a position to prove what caused them hearing aids for sale.

III. Decision of the Authority
III.1. The subject of the official data protection procedure and the examined data management period
III.1.1. The Authority received a number of reports in which the whistleblowers objected to the fact that the Obliger sent them a notification - an invitation to a screening test - by post, despite the fact that the whistleblowers had not previously consented to it.
The Authority launched ex officio proceedings to investigate whether the Obligor complies with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation during this data management practice.
According to the company register, the Obligor was founded on May 8, 1992. Its main activity is the retail trade of medical products. According to the Obligor's statement and the information available on his website, he is the market-leading distributor of hearing aids in the country and the world. According to the company register, the Obligor currently operates 20 locations and 62 branches in Hungary.
III.1.2. The Authority NAIH-7550-1/2021. as stated in order no.
The data management period of the Obligor examined in this procedure is the period from January 1, 2020 to October 5, 2021.
III.2. Brief summary of the examined data management activity
III.2.1. In connection with inquiries sent by post, the Obligee manages the name and address data of the persons concerned - as possible patients. The Obligee requested the name and address data from the BM in order to find the persons concerned.
During the examined data management period, the purpose of data use indicated by the Obligee in the data request was, on the one hand, contacting and maintaining contact for direct marketing purposes, and then, as indicated in subsequent requests (after February 23, 2021), the purpose of data management was market research.
III.2.2. According to the Obligor's declaration, he requests name and address data from BM on average every month. Within the examined data management period - according to the attached application copies, between June 24, 2020 and August 4, 2021 - the Obligee applied to the BM 9 times with a request for data provision. In connection with these requests, the Obligee received an average of 300,000-400,000 name and address data from the BM.
According to the Obligee's declaration, the personal data processed in connection with postal inquiries is managed in an Excel spreadsheet, and the data provided by BM is also done in this format. In the attached Excel database, the obligee's surname, first name, first name2, PIR
 
22
(zip code), settlement, public area, character, house number, building, Lph., Em., Door, County code data is stored.
The legal basis for the data management related to the sending of postal notifications is both the declaration of the Obligee and the voluntary consent of the data subjects, as stated in the data management information attached by him and also available on the Obliger's website.
III.3. Data management practices related to postal inquiries of prospective customers of the Obligor
III.3.1. Requesting data from the personal data and address register
In accordance with its declaration and the attached data management information and data management register, the Obligee manages the names and addresses of the data subjects as potential customers in connection with postal inquiries. According to the Obligor's declaration, the source of the data is exclusively the citizens' personal data and address register.
According to his declaration, the Obligee requests name and address data from the BM for specific age groups on average every month - i.e. by defining a time interval covering several years. The period of use of the requested data is 6 months.
According to the attached copies of the data request request, the Obligee indicated the direct marketing purpose as the basis for the data provision in its requests dated June 24, 2020, September 4, 2020, and October 13, 2020.
The Obligor's request of January 25, 2021 also indicated the direct marketing purpose as the basis for the provision of data. However, the BM terminated the procedure in connection with this request, according to the reasons for its order, the reason for this was that the Obligee withdrew the request on February 22, 2021, citing lack of reason for the request.
Immediately thereafter, on February 23, 2021, the Obligee submitted another request for data provision to the BM, in which, however, the direct marketing purpose was no longer indicated as the basis for the provision of data, but contact and contact for market research purposes was indicated. In its decision, the BM granted the Obligee's request for data provision and allowed him to use regular group data provision for 6 months and to use the data in the context of market and public opinion research for the purpose of contacting and maintaining contact. BMSZAE/382-1/2021 dated March 2, 2021. according to the reasons for decision no., the Obligee proved his right to "conduct market and public opinion research activities" with a copy of the company extract from Nytv. in paragraph (3) of § 19 and Dmtv. In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of § 4".
III.3.2. Legal basis for data management
Based on the definition of the GDPR, the name and address are the personal data of the data subject, while any operation performed on the data, such as the collection, recording, storage, organization and use of the data, is considered data management.
For data processing to be legal, the data controller must have a legal basis for data processing in accordance with Article 6 (1) of the GDPR.
 
23
The Obligee indicated the voluntary consent of the data subjects as the legal basis for its data processing – i.e. contact via postal inquiry – since, according to its position, the exercise of data subject rights is ensured and the data subjects can withdraw their consent at any time. The affected parties can do this by indicating in a statement addressed to the BM that they do not wish to make their data available for market and public opinion research purposes, i.e. they live according to Nytv. with the right to prohibit the release of data contained in § 2.
According to the Obliger's point of view, the data subjects have the opportunity to declare to BM or to the Obliger that they do not wish to consent to the processing of their data. If they do not do this, their consent will be deemed to have been given.
Nytv. According to the provisions of § 3, the personal data and address register is a public register, which contains and certifies the personal, address and notification address data of the citizens included in the register as specified in the Official Gazette, as well as the changes that have occurred in them. The task of the registry is to collect and manage the data specified in the Official Gazette and their changes, to issue documents about them and to provide data to the authorized persons defined by law.
According to the Obligor's point of view, the consent of the persons concerned, i.e. the citizens included in the personal data and address register, can be considered automatically given, unless the release of their data has been prohibited in the personal data and address register.
Article 4, Clause 11 of the General Data Protection Regulation states that the data subject's consent is a voluntary, specific and clearly informed statement of the data subject's will, by which the data subject indicates by means of a statement or an unmistakable act of confirmation that he/she gives his/her consent to the personal data concerning him/her to manage data.
In order for the data controller to be able to legitimately refer to the legal basis of the consent, all conceptual elements of the consent must meet the relevant requirements.
5/2020 on consent of the European Data Protection Board. guidelines No. 2, as well as those explained in the guidelines No. WP259 on consent of the Data Protection Working Group established on the basis of Article 29 of the Data Protection Directive, issued as its predecessor, confirm that a statement or an act clearly expressing confirmation is a prerequisite for regular consent. The data subject must make a clear declaration of consent. Recital (42) of the General Data Protection Regulation also states that the data controller must provide a pre-formulated declaration of consent, which must be made available in an understandable and easily accessible form.
Based on the data subject's consent, data processing may take place if he/she consents to the processing of his/her personal data by a clear affirmative act. This affirmative action fulfills the data subject's right to informational self-determination: based on adequate information, the data subject considers whether or not to give consent to specific data management. Consent will be clear if the data controller ensures that the data subject must take an active action in order for data processing to take place. For this, any statement or action that clearly indicates that the data subject has given his consent to the planned processing of his personal data is acceptable.
At the same time, the silence of the person concerned cannot be accepted as an affirmative act. If the data subject does not take any active action regarding the granting of consent, then the data controller cannot conclude from this that the data subject has consented to data processing.
 
24
The Obligee therefore bases the existence of consent to data management on the fact of being included in a public register. However, according to the Authority's point of view, being in the register alone cannot be considered a concrete, clear declaration of the will of the person concerned, and above all it cannot be considered voluntary and based on adequate information. Citizens included in the personal data and address register, as a public register, do not have the option of choosing whether or not to be included in the register, the register is not a register based on the voluntary consent of citizens. Nytv. Pursuant to the provisions of § 2, they have the right to prohibit the release of the data registered about them, the failure to do so - i.e. the "listening" of the data subject as explained above - does not mean that the data subject has consented to the Nytv . It can be issued during the performance of data provision in accordance with § 19, paragraph (1), and the data subject can therefore be contacted by anyone by post.
Consent is also closely related to appropriate prior information, i.e. that the data subject has adequate information in connection with the data management conditions before making the decision to grant consent, which is also clearly lacking in this case.
According to Article 7 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, in the case of consent as a legal basis, the data controller must also be able to prove that the data subject has consented to the processing of his personal data, which obligation - subject to the principle of accountability - also includes that the data controller can prove , that certain conceptual elements of the consent (adequate information, voluntariness, clarity of the consent) were properly applied during the obtaining of the consent, and also fulfilled the additional requirements set out by the decree in connection with the consent. These conditions obviously do not apply during data processing by the Obligor due to the reasons explained above.
Based on all of this, the data management of the Obligor in this form - i.e. contacting by mail - cannot have a legal basis for consent according to Article 6 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation, since all its conceptual elements are missing.
Based on the above, the Obligee violated Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as it unlawfully based its data processing on the legal basis of consent and did not prove the existence of a valid legal basis to the Authority.
According to the Authority's point of view, an appropriate procedure that can be followed in order to ensure the legality of the additional requirements of data management is if the organization requesting the data does not request the provision of citizens' personal data from the personal data and residential address register, but Nytv. As explained in paragraph (4) of § 18, the so-called initiates a contact procedure, during which the body of the register searches for the designated circle of persons, delivering the initiator's message to the recipients. The recipient, in case of interest, visits the initiating body himself, so the legal basis for data management on the part of the initiating body will in this case be the consent of the person concerned.
III.3.3. Purpose-bound data management
According to the principle of purpose-bound data management according to Article 5 (1) point b) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the collection of personal data is only defined, clear and
 
25
may be done for a legitimate purpose and may not be processed in a way that is incompatible with these purposes. Furthermore, according to the provisions of recital (39), the specific purposes of personal data management must be explicitly stated and legal, and must be defined at the time of collection of personal data.
The scope of the data must be limited to the minimum necessary for the purpose in accordance with the principle of data saving according to Article 5 (1) point c) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
According to the Obligor's statement, the purpose of using the requested data (name and address data) is to contact and maintain contact within the framework of market and public opinion research.
Nytv. According to Section 19 (1) point c), any legal person is entitled to request the provision of name and address data, with proof of the purpose and legal basis of the use, in order to compile a sample necessary to start public opinion polls and market research. According to paragraph (3) of the same §, the applicant must also properly prove his/her right to perform the activity specified there, as well as to request data.
According to the justification of the "1-year license application for contacting and maintaining contact for the purpose of market research" submitted to the Obligatory BM dated February 23, 2021, the purpose of data use is "to be able to contact the population in areas related to health preservation, including hearing and hearing loss. ".
Based on the justification for the license application for direct marketing data previously submitted to the BM, the purpose of data use is to "inform the public about our hearing care service.".
Therefore, from March 2021, the Obligee requested the requested data no longer for use related to direct marketing purposes, but in connection with market research, and the provision of data was authorized by the BM for this purpose.
Therefore, the Obligor requested data from BM for direct marketing, i.e. direct business acquisition, up to this date (March 2021), despite the fact that since April 26, 2019, Kktv. its scope no longer extends to natural and legal persons who require or process name and address data for the purpose of contacting them for direct business acquisition, i.e. as of April 26, 2019, the legal authorization of this data management has ceased.
The Kktv. according to its previous definition, direct business acquisition (direct marketing) is the set of informational activities and additional services carried out by the method of direct inquiry, the purpose of which is directly related to the sale, service or sales promotion of products or services, Grt. transmission of advertising to consumers or commercial partners according to point d) of § 3.
At the same time, it can be concluded that, despite the newly indicated purpose of data use (market research) in the application, the Obligor's actual data use practice did not change compared to the previous ones until July 2021, according to the Obligor's statement and the content of the postal notification sample attached by him, the notification remained unchanged until July 2021. part 2.1. the same informative text described in sub-point xii) of section 10 was included as on the postal notices previously sent for direct marketing purposes. The Obligor provides the requested data
 
26
therefore, he continued to use it unchanged, i.e. he handled the requested data for the purpose of contacting his potential patients by mail in a addressed letter and informing them of the location and time of the free hearing screening service provided by the Obligor.
It can be concluded that the "market research" as a data processing purpose indicated in the information sheet, however, masks the real purpose, which is also confirmed by the fact that the subject indicated as a data processing purpose in the data requests submitted to the BM is not specifically market research, but misleadingly "contacting for the purpose of market research and contact", which purpose is a general concept, and taking into account the data management activity carried out by the Obligor, the underlying purpose is still the direct marketing purpose.
In relation to the two-page, undated document called "Market Research Plan" attached by the Obligee to the Authority's invitation, the Authority found that it cannot actually be considered a research plan, but in terms of content is only a copy of the first two pages of the previously attached market research study, so the Authority considers it a research plan. he could not evaluate it as a plan and as a support for the market research goal.
According to the Authority, in the statements of the Obligee regarding what business and other decisions were based on his activities, which he assessed as market research, he only formulated ideas for the future. The market research study attached by the Obligee during the procedure indicated the period between March 2021 and September 2021 as the period examined during the market research, despite this, the Obliger was unable to present the decisions and results made on the basis of the market research, the actual professional market research, upon the call of the Authority did not prove it to the Authority.
Also based on the Obligor's statements - "based on the results of the study, a strategy based on market analysis was developed, the target audience was defined, the target audience was personalized, the main touchpoints were created, a sales strategy was planned, new hearing salons were planned, closed, additional resources were planned or downsized" - the conclusion it can be deduced that the activity he evaluates as market research is an activity closely related to marketing.
According to the Obligor's reference, the name and address data were needed to establish contact with future customers, which essentially meant that he tried to reach new customers by sending an invitation, which also proves the marketing purpose. This is supported by the finding already referred to above, that until July 2021, the content of the information placed on the notices did not provide any information that the Obligor's activities would serve the purpose of market research.
In its reply letter sent to the Authority on August 8, 2022, the Obligee also referred to the postal inquiries as "direct marketing postal inquiries" in several places, and in its statements also referred to the table containing the data requested from the BM as "for direct marketing purposes data managed and stored in the DM table" (points 6 and 14 of the response letter dated August 8, 2022).
The Authority evaluates the above as the fact that the Mandatory did not provide information confirming the conduct of the market research, and the attached documents and statements were evaluated by the Authority as not proving the existence of the market research objective.
Based on all of this, according to the Authority's point of view, it can be established that the Obligor's data requests to the BM from the end of February 2021 - the apparent compliance with the legal requirements
 
27
in order to comply - he tried to transform his data management into market research in such a way that he continued his data management for the purpose of direct marketing under this name. However, despite the fact that the Obligee indicated market research as the purpose of the data use, it continued to address the data subjects with the previous request samples until July 2021, so the primary purpose of the data management - about which the request sent to the data subjects did not contain any information at all - remains direct business acquisition volt.
The informational text subsequently placed on the notices by the Obligor - following the start of the official inspection and modified as a result - indicates market research as the purpose of data use, taking into account, however, that the Obligor - according to both his declaration and the information available on his website - country and the world's leading distributor of hearing aids, and the company's main activity is also the retail trade of medical products, based on the reasons presented above, the primary purpose of the data management was still the previously mentioned direct business acquisition (direct marketing), and not the Kktv. According to the definition of point 3 of § 2, the examination of the consumer habits of the data subject (market research), i.e. as stated in the information contained in the notification applicable from July 2021: "4. Purpose of data management/data use: market research. We are contacting you with this letter because we want to assess how much of the population of Hungary in the age group between ...-... wants to use our company for a hearing test".
Based on the above, the Obligee violated the principle of purpose limitation according to Article 5 (1) point b) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
III.3.4. The purpose must be explained in a clear, obvious, understandable language in such a way that the affected parties are aware of all the essential circumstances of data management, the specific goals and the range of data aligned with them, as well as the process of managing their personal data. This expectation of the data controller follows from the principle of transparency and fair data management according to Article 5 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation, and the conditions for the enforcement of the data subject's rights can be derived from this.
Compliance with the principle of being bound to a purpose therefore consists of two main parts: on the one hand, it includes the choice of a clear and at the same time legal purpose, and on the other hand, as a consequence, the handling of personal data in a way that is compatible with the purpose and goals. The expectations arising from these are the following:
- a concretely defined purpose, declared before the start of data management (this was completely omitted when contacting the data subjects by post);
- legitimate purpose in accordance with the legal basis and in connection with the data management (the Obligee based its data management related to postal inquiries on an inappropriate legal basis as explained in point III.3.2, and the definition of the purpose of the data management (data use) cannot be considered realistic during the examined data management period;
- understandable communication to the target group, not ambiguous or misleading (in the first half of the examined data management period, no adequate information was provided to the data subjects - especially about the purpose and legal basis of data management - the Obligor, based on the available information, in order to fulfill the request for data changed the purpose of data use indicated earlier (direct marketing) to the purpose of market research in order to apparently comply with legal requirements, but at the same time there was no change in the actual data use activity and notification sending practice, which confirms that the purpose of data management
 
28
has not actually changed, the market research goal has always been pushed into the background compared to the primary, direct marketing goal);
- in the case of additional goals and objectives, interpretation according to the test of compatibility, which usually assumes a high degree of similarity between the earlier and later goals (in this case, the compatibility of goals did not arise, so compliance with this condition is irrelevant).
Based on the available information, the Authority established that the Obligor - in III.3.3. as detailed in point - despite the change in legislation, in order to demonstrate compliance with it, it deceptively wanted to continue its previous direct marketing data processing as if the purpose of the data processing was market research, i.e. as if its data processing met the changed legal conditions. However, providing the opportunity to participate in the free hearing screening and sending invitations to those concerned by mail was still primarily for the purpose of sales, because according to the Authority's point of view, the research into consumer habits from the point of view of who buys the hearing screening cannot be considered market research, nor is it primarily market research. part and who subsequently buys a product. If this were solely for the purpose of market research, then the research of the intention to participate would be sufficient for the market research, following the principle of data saving.
According to the Authority's findings, the data processing was still carried out for sales and direct marketing purposes, to which the information should have been extended. On the other hand, the Obligor indicated market research as the purpose of data management. As a result, there was a clear lack of accurate and factual information, which is essential for proper information.
On the basis of the above, the Authority concludes that the Obligor has violated the fair procedure pursuant to Article 5 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation by misleading the affected parties and the Ministry of the Interior regarding the real purpose of the data management, and by concealing the real purpose of the data management principle.
III.3.5. Information provided during the postal inquiry
III.3.5.1. According to Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Obligee, as an independent data controller, is obliged to take appropriate measures in order to provide the data subjects with all the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 regarding the processing of personal data and Articles 15-22 . and provide each piece of information according to Article 34 in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form, clearly and comprehensibly worded.
The system of appropriate information in the General Data Protection Regulation serves to ensure that the data subject is aware of which personal data will be handled by which data controller and for which purpose and how. This is essential in order to be in a position to meaningfully exercise your data subject rights.
In the case of data management based on Article 6(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation, based on Article 4, Point 11 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data controller is obliged to provide information on the basis of which informed consent can be given, not only before data processing begins, but also before consent is obtained .
The data subject's consent to data processing can only be valid if it is specific
 
29
for the purpose(s) - which can be specified separately for each purpose - and appropriate information is provided before that, which puts the data subject in a position to make an appropriate decision on granting consent and meets all other validity requirements stipulated in the General Data Protection Regulation. Both the provisions of the preamble and Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation require the achievement of results when determining the data controller's obligations, i.e. the data controller must provide such assistance to the data subject so that he or she can exercise all data subject rights in an informed manner.
III.3.5.2. During the investigated data management, the Obligee visits potential patients by mail in such a way that it sends a notification about the location and time of the free hearing screening service it provides.
The principle of fair and transparent data management contained in Article 5 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation requires that the data subject be informed of the fact and purpose of data management. Therefore, one of the essential conditions for the legality of data management is that the data controller properly informs the data subject about all the important circumstances of data management.
13-14 of the General Data Protection Regulation. articles determine the content of the information that must be provided during the processing of personal data. Different rules apply to this (content and deadline) depending on whether the data was obtained from the data subject or not, while Article 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation provides guidelines for the formal requirements of the information.
Since the Obligor uses the data provided by the BM - i.e. after collecting the personal data not from the data subject, but from another source - to search for potential patients through postal inquiries, the Obligor must, taking into account the provisions of Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation, provide the data subjects with their personal data information related to its management must be made available within a reasonable period of time.
Regarding the examined data management period, the Obligor has attached two notification samples, according to his declaration, applied consecutively.
Both notification samples contain information related to data management, and the notification samples are actually distinguished by the content of the informational text placed on them.
III.3.5.3. According to the Obligor's statement, until July 2021, the name notification sent to potential patients by post contained the following information:
"If you no longer wish to receive such inquiries from Amplifon Magyarország Kft., you can cancel using one of the following contact details:
On the Internet at the e-mail address adatvedelem@amplifon.com.

In connection with the examined data management, the Authority established that the information placed on the notice sent by the Obligor to potential patients by post until July 2021 did not contain the most important information contained in Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation:
i) The prospectus did not specifically name who can be considered a data controller. Although the information did mention the name and contact information of the Obligor, the only conclusion that can be drawn from it is that the Obligor is the data controller in connection with the examined data management \[GDPR Article 14 (1) a)\].
ii) The prospectus did not inform the data subjects about the (real) purpose of personal data management and the legal basis for data management \[GDPR Article 14 (1) c)\].
However, the information also contains two legal references, which gives the impression, in a deceptive way, that the processing of the personal data of the recipient of the information, as a data subject, is necessary to fulfill the legal obligation contained in the legislation referred to in the information, i.e. its legal basis is Article 6 (1) of the GDPR c) would be the fulfillment of a legal obligation.
iii) In its response to the Authority, the Obligee provided information about the data processors it used, however, the information placed on the notice did not include any information regarding which data processors it uses during data processing and what data processing activities they carry out \[GDPR Article 14 (1 ) e)\].
In addition to the above, the information sheet did not contain additional important information necessary to ensure fair and transparent data management:
iv) The information tangentially mentioned the possibility of blocking personal data and data in the address register, if the data subject does not wish to receive similar inquiries, and then informed that his data will be automatically deleted from the Obligor's database. However, the information provided no explanation as to what the automatic deletion takes place automatically in relation to. This sentence of the information is in contradiction with the provisions of the BM's decision authorizing the provision of data, according to which "the requested data from the personal data and address register can only be used within six months of the request or the last consultation." \[GDPR Article 14 (2) a)\].
v) Regarding the source of the data, contrary to the Obligor's statement and the contents of the attached documents, the information also provided the data subjects with the information until July 2021 that the Obligor purchased the data from the Central Office of Public Administration and Electronic Public Services, which office, however, operates on December 31, 2016 , i.e. nearly a year and a half before the General Data Protection Regulation became applicable. All of this could also be interpreted by the affected parties as - assuming that the information contained in the information corresponds to reality - that their personal data will be processed by the Obligor from this date at the latest \[GDPR Article 14 (2) f)\].
In connection with the previous point (iv), this also calls into question the veracity of the statement in the information that the data subject's data is automatically deleted from the Obligor's database.
vi) The information did not provide comprehensive information regarding the data subject's rights either, it only contained that the data subject could cancel the sending of inquiries at the contact details of the Obligor, which can be interpreted as information about the right to erasure \[GDPR Article 14 (2) c)\].
vii) In the statement given during the procedure, the Obligee indicated the consent of the data subjects as the legal basis for its data processing. In addition to the information regarding this
 
31
did not contain any information at all, in which case the information should have provided the data subjects with additional information about their right to withdraw consent \[GDPR Article 14 (2) d)\].
viii) The prospectus also does not provide data subjects with information on the right to submit a complaint to the supervisory authority \[GDPR Article 14 (2) e)\].
The Authority established that, based on the details detailed above, the information placed on the notice sent by the Obligor to potential patients by post until July 2021 did not provide the data subjects with information on all the essential circumstances of data management, thereby violating the provisions of Article 14 of the GDPR.
III.3.5.4. According to its declaration, the Obligee has updated the data management information on the notification sent to the data subjects from July 2021 (hereinafter: current information). After this date, the name notification sent to potential patients by mail is part 1 1.4 of this decision. contained the information described in subsection xi) of
In relation to the current information, the Authority established that the legal basis for data management was not indicated in it, but only informs the data subjects of the purpose of data management \[GDPR Article 14 (1) c)\]. Furthermore, in relation to the stated purpose of data management, the Authority shall refer to Section III.3.3 of this decision. according to what was explained and established in point 2, the real and actual purpose of the data management was not identified to the data subjects.
According to point 1 of the information sheet, "We inform you that the GDPR, Infotv. and the LLC. provides information", which, taking into account that the information sheet does not provide information on the legal basis of data management, misleads those concerned, as it creates the impression that data management takes place in the context of fulfilling a legal obligation.
Furthermore, regarding the information on the notice, the Authority found that it was not appropriate due to its small font size. The transparency of data management must also be ensured by the use of a suitable font size that facilitates the readability of the text.
During the period under review, the Obligee therefore did not provide clear, adequate and truthful information to those concerned about all the essential circumstances of data management in connection with postal enquiries, thus violating Article 14, Paragraphs (1)-(2) of the GDPR.
Furthermore, by not providing transparent and clear information, the Obligee violated the provisions of Article 12 (1) of the GDPR.
ARC. Legal consequences
IV.1. Based on Article 58(2)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Authority determines that the Obligee, by sending a postal notification containing an invitation to a screening test, without adequate information, a concretely defined and real purpose, and with an inadequate legal basis, treats the data subjects contact data (name and address), violates the principle of fair procedure according to Article 5 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the principle of purposefulness according to Article 5 (1) point b), Article 6 ( 1) and, in connection with the above, the obligation to provide information according to Article 12 (1) and Article 14.

In view of this, the Authority, on the basis of Article 58 (2) point g) of the General Data Protection Regulation, ex officio instructs the Obligee to delete in a documented manner the name and address data of the data subjects stored by it in connection with the sending of postal notifications, i.e. from all personal data and address registers contact data provided by BM at the request of the Obligor.
IV.2. The Authority examined whether the imposition of a data protection fine against the Obligor is justified. In this context, the Authority is in accordance with Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and Infotv. 75/A. §, considered all the circumstances of the case and determined that, in the case of the violations discovered during the present procedure, the warning is neither a proportionate nor a dissuasive sanction, and therefore a fine must be imposed. In the present case, the protection of personal data - which is the responsibility of the Authority - cannot be achieved without imposing a data protection fine based on the set of circumstances detailed below. The imposition of fines serves both special and general prevention, according to which the decision is also published on the website of the Authority.
IV.3. When determining the amount of the fine, the Authority first of all took into account that the violations committed by the Obligor are classified as violations of the category of higher fines according to Article 83 (5) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation \[GDPR Article 83 (2) point a) \], based on this, the maximum fine that can be imposed is EUR 20,000,000, or, in the case of enterprises, an amount of no more than 4% of the total annual world market turnover of the previous financial year. Taking this into account, the maximum fine that can be imposed on the Obligor is HUF 101,677,120.

However, the Authority has already condemned the Obligee in the investigation procedure conducted before the general data protection regulation became applicable - in which case it examined the Obligor's data management practices related to its direct marketing activities carried out through general practitioners (NAIH/2017/4819/V.), therefore the Authority took into account to a lesser extent \[GDPR Article 83(2)(e)\];
- After the start of the official inspection, the Obligee changed the text of the information on the notice sent by post, and tried to bring its information into line with the requirements contained in the General Data Protection Regulation \[GDPR Article 83 (2) point c).
- The Authority exceeded Infotv. 60/A. § (1), the reason for this was the difficulty of clarifying the facts.
When imposing a fine on the Obligor, the Authority took into account the following as aggravating circumstances:
- the nature of the violations is particularly serious, the Obligee has committed several violations, furthermore
the principle of fair procedure is also violated \[GDPR Article 83 (2) point a)\];
- I.1 of this decision part 1.4. in subsection xviii) and III.2. based on what was written in point 2, the number of data subjects is significant: in the period under review, during a total of 9 data services, the Obligee received the personal data of 3-400,000 data subjects from the BM, to whom it sent postal letters \[GDPR Article 83 (2) point a)\];
- the range of stakeholders targeted by the Obligor is mostly the elderly, who are less able to judge the legality of the processing of their personal data and are more easily influenced for the sake of their health \[GDPR Article 83 (2) point a)\];
 
33
- the illegal data processing was caused by the Obligor's seriously negligent behavior and data processing practices \[GDPR Article 83 (2) point b)\].
IV.4. When determining the amount of the data protection fine, the following circumstances neither aggravated nor alleviated the amount of the fine, they had a neutral effect:
- the Obligee cooperated with the Authority during the procedure, but this is legal
obligation, the absence of which could be an aggravating circumstance \[GDPR Article 83 (2) point f)\];
- based on stakeholder complaints received against the Obligor, the Authority detected the likelihood that the Obligor's data management practices were unlawful, which resulted in the procedure initiated by the present office \[GDPR Article 83 (2) point h)\];
- according to the latest available 2020 data, the net sales revenue of the Obligor was HUF 2,541,928,000. The Obligor has no published report for the year 2021.
