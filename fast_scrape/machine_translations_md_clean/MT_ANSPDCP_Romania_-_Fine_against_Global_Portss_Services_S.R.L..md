## English Summary

### Facts

The controller installed a GPS monitoring system in a company car. According to the controller, the purpose of this installation was the necessity of keeping track of the working time of employees. Data subjects were not informed about the existence of such a tracking device.

The data subject, an employee, filed a complaint with the DPA.

### Holding

First, the DPA found that this processing activity lacked of legal basis. More specifically, the DPA pointed out that the controller had not proven that it had previously used other less intrusive methods to achieve the purpose of the processing. Therefore, it found a violation of [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [5(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), [5(2)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR") and [6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

Secondly, the DPA noted that the controller did not provide data subject with the information set by [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"). Therefore, it found a violation of this article in combination with [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR").

Finally, the DPA pointed out that the controller had stored the data for a period of 6 months, which exceeds the period of 30 days set by [Article 5(1)(e) of the national law implementing GDPR](https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/203151) (_Lege nr. 190/2018_). Therefore, it found a violation of [Article 5(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1e "Article 5 GDPR").

On these grounds, it fined the controller RON 9,947.60 (€2,000).

## Comment

This summary is based on a press release. The Romanian DPA does not publish full decisions.

The Romanian law implementing GDPR (Law no. 190/2018) has introduced supplementary conditions for processing of personal data in an employment context. More specifically, Art. 5 of that law provides "In cases where workplace monitoring systems through electronic communications and/or video surveillance measures are used, the processing of the personal data of employees, for the purpose of pursuing the legitimate interests of the employer, is permitted only if: (...) d) Other less intrusive forms and means for reaching the aim pursued by the employer did not prove to be efficient; (...)"

In other words, the DPA does not have to even analyse whether the processing could be performed through less intrusive means, and the controller cannot even claim that it couldn't, if they have not already actually implemented other means first. There are no known situations when a controller performed a legitimate interest assessment showing less intrusive means are not sufficient and thus chose the more intrusive ones directly, but it is not impossible that the DPA would reject that based on the literal reading of the law.

It is worth noting that even though this supplementary condition plays a significant role, the press release for this decision only mentions breaches of GDPR provisions as a basis.
