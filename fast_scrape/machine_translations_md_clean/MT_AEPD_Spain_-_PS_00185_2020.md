## English Summary

### Facts

The company Miguel Ibáñez Bezanilla is a car number plate online seller.

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen (the claimant) stating that (i) the defendant has not adopted any safety measures for its website, that (ii) such website did not offer any kind of data protection information on purpose, nor period of storage, and that (iii) the claimant has contacted the defendant in order to request him to adopt such measures, but he has received no answer.

### Dispute

During the first research procedures, the AEPD proved that (i) in order to make an order, the website requires personal data such as name, surname, scanned copy of the Spanish national ID, driving licence, chassis number, car number plate and proof of payment, (ii) the website does not offer a safe "https" encryption protocol, making possible for other user to intercept any communications between the user and the server, (iii) the privacy policy is not updated and refers to the former Spanish data protection law LOPD 15/1999, (iv) there is no banner on cookies usage when accessing the website, and the detailed part of the website referring to cookies does not offer information on identity, features or length, nor possibility to refuse them. The defendant did not answer any requirements of the AEPD, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed Article 32 GDPR, Article 13 GDPR and Article 22 LSSI, as the website is not technically safe, the privacy policy is not updated, and the cookies information is not sufficient. Consequently, the AEPD decided to impose a fine of € 3000 to the defendant; additionally, it required the defendant to solve all the infractions of the website within a period of one (1) month since the decision.
