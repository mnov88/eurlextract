## English Summary

### Facts

The TV2 Media Group Ltd., the controller, is one of Hungary's largest content providers. It operates several TV channels and online streaming services and has two websites tv2play.hu and tenyek.hu. "Tenyek.hu" contains predominantly news content, while "tv2play.hu" focuses on various audiovisual media content. In 2021, they had between 1.6 million and 2.4 million monthly visitors and a net revenue of 49,000,000,000 HUF (approx. €127,000,000).

Based on a "public interest notification" the Hungarian DPA started an _ex officio_ investigation into the data processing of the websites. There was a concern that the controller did not provide data subjects with adequate information about the processing and that the consent management platform (CMP) on the websites did not collect the consent of data subjects in a transparent and clear manner.

The investigation revealed a number of potential data protection deficits.

The CMP of the controller offered data subject's with the possibility to give consent to cookies by clicking an "OK, continue" button. However, the only alternative was a "more options" button which redirected to a second level of the CMP with more information and more detailed consent options. On this second level of the CMP, users were provided with two tabs for different categories of processing. On one tab, the user was able to give "consent" to different processing purposes. The other tab was titled "legitimate interest" and allowed the data subjects to object to data processing. Confusingly, the processes listed in both tabs was almost completely identical. They included purposes such as "selection of basic ads", "Measuring ad performance", and "creating a personalized advertising profile". The processing purposes ""storing and/or accessing information stored on the device"" was only listed under the consent tab.

Regarding the meaning of "legitimate interest" the controller explained that, the way in which it is used on the website, the term would not relate to the legal basis under the GDPR but was meant as a "category". Consequently, the controller also had made no interest assessment.

Lastly, it was unclear to the DPA how consent could be withdrawn, once it had been given.

### Holding

The DPA decided that the controller's conduct was in breach of the GDPR.

First, the DPA concluded that the content provider is the controller, which is ultimately responsible for the processing of the personal data.

The content provider used the websites to distribute its media content for its business interests. No other party had the right to decide whether the content provider should distribute its media content through the websites or whether it should cease to do so, and whether and through which service provider advertising should be displayed. The content provider operated the websites at its own discretion and in its commercial interest.

For all the processing examined in relation to the websites, the content provider determined the purposes and means of the processing and enabled third parties to place content on the websites. The DPA therefore held that the content provider was the controller pursuant to [Article 4(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#7 "Article 4 GDPR").

Second, the DPA held that the controller violated the principle of fairness and transparency pursuant to [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 12(1),](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") by not appropriately informing the data subjects about the legal basis of the processing.

The DPA pointed out that [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR") required controllers to take appropriate measures to provide data subjects with all the information referred to in [Article 13 to](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") [14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"), in [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") to [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR"), and in [Article 34 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR "Article 34 GDPR"). The information has to be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible manner and an easily accessible form, in clear and plain language. Moreover, [Article 13(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#1c "Article 13 GDPR") requires, among other things, that the controller informs its data subjects about the correct legal basis for their processing.

However, in the present case, the controller indicated "consent" as a legal basis for browsing-related processing, irrespective of the fact that without certain technical cookies the websites cannot function. The purpose “To store and/or access information stored on the device” was only based on consent instead of legitimate interest. However, the DPA argued that without these cookies the websites would not be able to work. Consequently, the legal basis for consent is not appropriate, as a successful website visit of a data subject means that information on the data subject's terminal were written and read regardless of consent, and could not be opted out or withdrawn.

In addition, the term “legitimate interest” used by the controller is equivalent to the term used in the GDPR under [Article 6(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). Therefore, since the controller explained that its "legitimate interest" would not refer to the "GDPR legitimate interest", it was either used incorrectly by the controller – and misleading – or used correctly, but without any information and without any consideration of the interests involved. Either way, the DPA considered it unfair and opaque contrary to [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR") to indicate substantially the same purposes on both the consent and the legitimate interest tabs. It gives data subjects the impression that the same processing is possible even if consent is not given. Moreover, the information on the second level of the CMP was provided in an exceptionally long text on data management and was only available in an unreasonably small area of the screen, readable only a few lines at a time. The long text cannot be described as concise or clear.

As a result of the above, the DPA concluded that the controller violated the principle of fair and transparent processing pursuant to [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

Third, the DPA held that the controller processed personal data without a legal basis as it neither fulfilled the conditions for Article 6(1)(a) GDPR "consent" nor Article 6(1)(f) "legitimate interest".

The DPA decided that consent could not be used as a legal basis. It noted that it was not as easy to withdraw consent as it was to give it. The CMP did not provide an easily accessible possibility, neither for personal data directly processed by the controller nor for personal data transferred to third parties. There was no information provided on how to easily withdraw consent. Moreover, in addition, due to the opaqueness of the processing and the lack of clear information, as described above, consent, as a general rule, could not be considered to be a valid legal basis as it could not have been informed.

Next, the controller could also not rely on legitimate interest for its processing. During the investigation, it became clear that the controller had not clearly indicated which processes were to be based on legitimate interest and which not. However, the DPA asserted that it is not the task and responsibility of the data subject, nor of the DPA, rather than that of the controller, to identify, describe and justify the specific purposes and legal grounds for the processing. Controllers are required to clearly justify, consider and provide safeguards for the purposes and legal basis on which they intend to process which personal data. These safeguards should ensure, among other things, that the data subject is aware of the processing and can object to it before the processing takes place.

For the above reasons, the DPA concluded that the controller infringed [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

In sum, the DPA found the controller to be in violation of the GDPR, specifically [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). It fined the controller 10,000,000 HUF (approx. €25,650). In determining the height of the fine, the DPA took into account some mitigating circumstances, namely, that the DPA had not previously found a data protection breach against the controller. Aggravating circumstances were that millions of data subjects were affected and that the processing was done for profiling purposes with commercial intent.

   website was renewed on December 16, 2020, which includes the entire IT, hardware and
   it also affected its software background, and development has been continuous ever since. The Customer is the examiner
   in connection with the procedure, he noticed that it was placed in the pop-up window on the "tenyek.hu" website

   link (button) does not direct to the right place, probably due to a technical error, which
   the Customer shall repair by September 30, 2021 at the latest.

   (iv) In all cases, the legal basis for cookies is the consent of the data subject.

   (v) Regarding the "tv2play.hu" website, there are two different consents
   framework at the same time, since the pop-up window belongs to the competence of atmedia Kft

   and the interface belongs to the management of the Customer. The blue bar is for cookies outside the advertising space

III. Decision

III.1. The person of the data controller

1.1. The Customer - among other things, based on what is written in points I.1.4.(i)-(ii) above - the Websites
uses it to distribute its own media content, exclusively for its own business interests. Third
party does not have the right to decide whether the Customer distributes through the Websites
its media content, or the Customer stops doing so, and whether advertisements should be displayed in addition, and
through which service provider. 12

1.2. The Customer operates the Websites based on his own decision and business interest
conditions - for example, with which partner it contracts to run advertisements - the Customer
Define.

1.3. In the case of all data management examined in connection with the Websites, with the data management
related goals and tools were determined by the Customer or made possible by a third party
parties to place content on the Websites, thus Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation
Based on point 7, the Customer is considered a data controller. The basic structure of the Websites and
operation, the information and consent framework found on them
its compliance depends on the active behavior of the Customer, a third party against the Customer's will

you cannot modify the Websites. For this reason, it is related to the investigated data management
responsibility - obtaining information and consent from the person concerned - all of the cases
based on its circumstances, the Customer is responsible regardless of who provided the individual modules of the Website
obtained, or whether this data is forwarded to third parties. There is no third party
in direct contact with the stakeholders, so the information and consent framework is legal
those who can have a direct and final influence on it can primarily be responsible for its compliance.

This does not affect the mutual accounting of different data managers and data processors, and the
internal agreements on the responsibility towards the data subjects of the General Data Protection Regulation
It is not amended based on Article 26 (3). This interpretation is reinforced by, among other things
Court of Justice of the European Union C-40/17. also paragraph 102 of its decision no.: "Directive 95/46 2.
in relation to the consent referred to in point h) of Article 7 and point a) of Article 7
it can be established that the collection and transmission of the data subject's personal data
must be given beforehand. In such circumstances, the website is the source of consent

the task of the operator, not the provider of the community module, since a
the personal data management process is initiated by the visitor viewing this website.
As the general counsel pointed out in point 132 of his opinion, there would not be
in accordance with the effective and timely protection of the rights of the data subject, if a
consent should be given to the joint data controller who only at a later stage
plays a role, i.e. the provider of the mentioned module.".

III.2. Description of data management

2.1. In the History Case, prepared by the Authority on December 6, 2021, from the Websites
according to the state recorded with screenshots, according to the facts detailed in point I

The Customer publishes media content on the Websites in connection with its display
uses cookies, as well as statistical, ad display, and I.1.5.(iv)-(v) above
"Creating a personalized advertising profile", "Personalised
select ads", "Create a personalized content profile", "Personalised
to adapt to personal preferences in an automated manner based on "content selection".
it is also used for profiling purposes according to Article 4, point 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation a
personal data contained in cookies.

2.2. Based on what is described in point I.1.5.(i) above, the examined cookies are assigned unique identifiers
to a specific person, which are, at least as pseudonymous data, definitely personal data
they matter, since their purpose is to identify a specific active user who is a natural
person.

2.3. Based on the revealed facts, the "tenyek.hu" website mostly contains news, a
The "tv2play.hu" website focuses on audiovisual media content.

2https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=216555&doclang=HU 13

2.4. The Websites may display advertisements during browsing, which may include the above
Depending on the choices according to I.1.5.(iv)-(v), personalized or general, and a
Recommended content on websites can also be adapted to individual browsing history,
furthermore, the use of the Websites is measured using unique identification data stored in cookies.
Some cookies contain session tokens to prevent online attacks, which

they make communication between the user's device and the Customer's servers more secure,
in which case a unique identifier is necessarily used.

2.5. I.1.5 above. on the basis of the information detailed in section
personal data - for example, which content you viewed, which ads you viewed,
which ads were clicked by the data subject - they are also used to personalize the content,
both with regard to the Websites and with regard to third-party partners.

2.6. In the examined period (from May 25, 2018 to February 21, 2022), the
Websites had content recorded on December 6, 2021, so the Authority
in the present case, he used this as a basis for judging legality. A statement to the contrary
During the procedure, the client did not indicate any other status regarding the examined period
yes. Later changes will be made by the Authority in determining the legal consequences for the future
considered, they do not affect the legality of the examined period.

III.3. The information in the examined period

3.1. According to Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer is the subject
it is the duty of the data controller responsible for data management to take appropriate measures
in order to ensure that, for the data subjects, Articles 13 and 14 relating to the processing of personal data

all the information mentioned in Article 15-22. and each according to Article 34
information in a concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible form, clearly and
provide it in a comprehensible way.

3.2. The system of appropriate information in the general data protection regulation serves to
so that the data subject can be aware of which personal data, which data controller and
for which purpose, how you will handle it. This is essential to be in a position to

to be able to meaningfully exercise its stakeholder rights.

3.3. Data management based on point a) of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
based on Article 4, point 11 of the General Data Protection Regulation, not only the data management
beginning, but before obtaining consent, the data controller is obliged to
to provide information on the basis of which informed consent can be given.

3.4. In relation to the legal basis of data subject consent according to the General Data Protection Regulation
it is important to emphasize that it does not mean that the data controller is subject to other legal obligations
applies as a general authority regardless of conditions that at any time and
can handle any personal data without limits for any reason. For data management
stakeholder consent can only be valid if it is for specific purpose(s) - per purpose
can be specified separately - they ask, and before that they provide adequate information, which in such a situation
brings the data subject to be able to make an appropriate decision about giving consent, and

complies with all other validity conditions prescribed in the General Data Protection Regulation
requirement. According to Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation,
the data controller must provide assistance to the data subject in such a way that it is all relevant to the data subject
can exercise his right in an informed manner. 14

3.5. As explained above, the obligation to provide information is not a mere "paperwork"
                                                                                            3
is an obligation in the General Data Protection Regulation. All in the preamble
contained, all the articles of the general data protection regulation require the achievement of results
when determining the obligations of a data controller, not just a specified minimum
proof of effort on the part of the data controller. The aim of the information is to put you in such a situation
brings the data subject so that the data subject's rights are in the right decision-making position

regarding its exercise.

3.6. In relation to the Websites, the Customer has indicated only the legal basis of consent
for all browsing-related data management, regardless of whether I.1.5.(ix) above
as written in point, the Websites cannot actually function without some technical cookies

function, and some cookies are definitely used regardless of consent
with unique identifiers. It is expected that the data management information of the 754 partners concerned
read it and withdraw the information provided for these third-party partners one by one
consent, in the opinion of the Authority, it is not a transparent and fair condition. That
this practice may be widely used by other data controllers, but not yet

legal. In relation to the vendor partner list referred to in point I.1.4.(x) above, the Customer
indicated the use of the IAB Europe framework. With data management by IAB Europe
in connection with the Belgian data protection authority stated that it is - among other things
due to lack of transparency and information - violates general data protection
decree, the legal interpretation of this decision also applies mutatis mutandis in this case. That's a fact

also supports that the argument put forward by the Customer - that it is a common solution in the industry
use - does not in itself affect the findings according to this procedure, no
is proof of compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation.

3.7. In relation to the Websites, it can be established that it is related to data management

extremely long informative text in an unreasonably small area of the screen, all at once
was available legibly in a few lines. The long text cannot even be called concise,
not clear either. "Accepting everything" is information that can be called meaningful at the first level
is possible without, "reject all" is only available at the second level. By the Customer
The term "legitimate interest" used can clearly correspond to general data protection

as a concept according to the decree, so it was either used completely incorrectly by the Customer - and because of this
the information was misleading - or you used it correctly, but all information and
without consideration of interests. In both cases, unfair and opaque are essentially the same
indication of goals on the consent and legitimate interest interface as well, as it gives the impression
in those concerned, that they are possible in the same way even without giving their consent

data management is another protest - now marked on the interface located on the third level
in its absence. If data processing according to the purposes placed on the "legitimate interest" interface is consent
in the absence of them, they do not take place, then the information and the interface are therefore misleading if
they happen, then because of that.

3.8. "Storing and/or accessing information stored on the device" is the only purpose that only a
giving or refusing consent can be found on the interface and not in the legitimate interest, even though
it is precisely this, without which the cookies necessary for operation cannot be placed and the
Websites would not work, so the legal basis for this consent is not appropriate, since a

The operation of websites means that writing and hosting is done independently of consent
reading, it cannot be denied or revoked. Because of this, for other reasons, but this is the goal
unfair and non-transparent information also exists.

3
it should be fair. For natural persons, it must be transparent that the information concerning them is personal
how their data is collected and used, how it is viewed or in what other way it is handled, as well as
in connection with the extent to which personal data is or will be processed. \[...\]"

3.9. Itemized and accurate identification of personal data and cookies necessary for operation
the definition of its purpose is completely absent from the information, and their legal basis as legitimate

no interest was indicated in connection with these and in the present procedure the Authority
his request was not supported in the consideration of interests. In the absence of this, the
information is necessarily incomplete and misleading, long and difficult to read
however, it is poor in useful information. Among other things, it does not show that specifically
which functions, which data is managed in cookies, why is it specifically essential a

for technical operation and whether this data is used for other purposes.

3.10. In all cases, it also lacks the same ease as giving consent
revocability, which is not easily ensured by the framework used on the Websites
available option neither directly managed by the Customer nor to third parties
regarding transmitted personal data. This deficiency also applies to information, that is

nor does it indicate in an easily accessible way how consent can be withdrawn.

3.11. The Customer could not indicate any reasonable reason why there are two
parallel consent management system in relation to the "tv2play.hu" website, to which the
The "tenyek.hu" website was also redirected during the examined period. Being the owner of the Websites
he did not properly coordinate with the advertising organizer contracted with him, and therefore for two years

consent was also requested in different ways to the cookies used by the Websites, no
can be accepted as an excuse. As explained earlier, achieving the right result is
Customer's responsibility as data controller. Intentional violation if the Customer knows about it
you reasonably need to know about your own online content, and over the years
does not take any meaningful steps for a quick solution.

3.12. Due to the above, it can be established that during the period under review, the Customer a
The information provided on websites about the management of personal data was violated by
fair and
the principle of transparent data management, Article 12 (1) and Article 13.

III.4. The legality of the data management of the Websites during the examined period

4.1. In the absence of adequate information, as a general rule, it was based on consent
data management in itself is illegal. This is supported by the European Data Protection Board
Also paragraph 62 of the 5/2020 Guidelines (hereinafter: 5/2020 Guidelines). Accordingly

if the data controller does not provide accessible information, the user has control over the data
its provision becomes apparent and consent becomes an invalid basis for data management.
The basic requirement of easy accessibility is confirmed by Guideline 66 of 5/2020.
and also paragraph 67. 5/2020 regarding information regarding consent
Paragraph 63 of the guidelines also emphasizes that consent based on information
the consequence of not complying with relevant requirements is that a

consent will be invalid and the data controller may violate the general data protection regulation
Article 6. Pursuant to paragraph 69 of Directive 5/2020, the electronic transfer
in the case of information, multi-level information can typically be used, however, the accurate and
it must be comprehensive and understandable. Multilevel should help, not hinder
access to basic information.

5 Guideline No. 5/2020 of the European Data Protection Board on consent pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679:
https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb\_guidelines\_202005\_consent\_en.pdf 16

4.2. Based on paragraph 64 of Directive 5/2020, in order for the consent to be informed
be based on, the data subject must be informed about certain key elements. That's why it is
The European Data Protection Board believes that valid consent requires at least a
the following information is required:

 (i) the identity of the data controller - this was not fulfilled in this case, "we and our partners" are the 754
       regardless of the partner, it is not specific enough, even the identity of the Customer is not clear
       marked on the settings interface available in the pop-up window;

 (ii) the purpose of each data processing operation for which consent is sought - this is not
       fulfilled properly, as indicated in the framework used by the Websites
       goals at two different levels in two different contexts, essentially the same - or it is

       for those involved, it can easily be assumed to be the same at first glance - with content
       its inclusion calls into question compliance with the goal-bound principle at the system level,
       furthermore, in addition to this systemic problem, the definition of certain goals - such as "That
       storing and/or accessing information stored on a device” both in itself and in
       on the basis of a more detailed description, it is too broad and can formally enable such data management,
       which obviously cannot be the purpose of the data subject in general (e.g. on the device
       accessing stored photos and documents;

 (iii) what type of data will be collected and used - this was not met
       accordingly, it is not clear and obvious to an average person concerned that the individual
       purposes for which your consent is requested, exactly which data will be used for what purpose
       use;

 (iv) the existence of the right to withdraw consent - this has not been fulfilled, it is not adequate

       clear information in the large amount of text, based on which it can be known that
       how and how consent can be revoked, this is about the operation
       it is not even possible;

 (v) where applicable, to use the data for automated decision-making
       relevant information in accordance with point c) of Article 22 (2) - this is present
       relevant and not relevant due to the recommendation system and personalized advertisements

       fulfilled, there is no specific information that both on and off the Websites

i.e. with adequate information and legal grounds for the necessary personal data

solution, the 30-day deadline for changes should be sufficient. I.2.2 above. in point

no significant changes have taken place. The general data protection regulation does not require that
for the data controller to negotiate the legal terms with each data processor for months or years
compliance, but to ensure compliance. From the Customer's organizational size and annual

   for profit through data sharing and advertisements. (general
   Article 83 (2) point b) of the Data Protection Regulation

   in the procedure with the aim of answering - he cooperated, however, the results of the cooperation
   there were only promises to achieve the compliance of the Websites and the double
