## English Summary

### Facts

The data controller, Piraeus Bank, provided data relating to a joint bank account to a third party who claimed to be the heir of one of the account holders who had died. This third party then used such data in a lawsuit against the other account holder, the data subject. The data subject filed a complaint with the DPA claiming that the transfer of their personal lacked a legal basis.

After investigating the matter, the controller acknowledged that its employee made a mistake by providing the requested information to a third party. The controller also reported having adopted all technical and organizational measures to ensure data security, which, however, is not able to prevent human error. Finally, it claimed that it was not necessary to notify the DPA and the data subject about the breach.

### Holding

The DPA highlighted the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency established by the GDPR and reinforced the responsibility controllers regarding the security of personal data. The DPA recalled the negative impacts that data breaches can have on data subjects, including physical, material or moral damages. For this reason, these breaches must be reported to the authority within 72 hours after the data controller becomes aware of them, in accordance with article [33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"). Likewise, the data subject must be notified according to [Article 34 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR "Article 34 GDPR"). For these reasons, the DPA not only recognized the illegality of the transfer of personal data to a third party, but also held that the controller failed to comply with the obligation to notify the breach.

Therefore, the DPA found a violation of [Articles 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR") and [(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") , [33](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR") and [34 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR "Article 34 GDPR"), and fined the controller €30,000.
