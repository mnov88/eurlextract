      The General Data Protection Regulation deals in its article 5 with the
principles that must govern the processing of personal data and mentions between
they the one of "legality, loyalty and transparency". The precept provides:

      "1. The personal data will be:
         a) Treaties in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner with the interested party; "

      Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

      "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it complies with at least one of the following
terms:
      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the

      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;
      (…) "

of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of fines

consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

      Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of

prescription, as a very serious offense.

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that according to
includes judgment nº \*\*\* JUDGMENT 1 of the Court of First Instance and

personal data of the third party without standing for it. The behavior described violates the
article 6.1. of the RGPD and is subsumed in the sanctioning type of article 83.5.a, of the
