## English Summary

### Facts

The case initiated from a complaint made by a data subject who filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA requesting the DPA to declare that a controller - a company providing accommodation services - within the neighbouring property unlawfully processes personal data with its surveillance camera systems (CCTV). The data subject requested the DPA to 1) prohibit the controller from monitoring the data subject's property with its CCTV systems, and 2) to order the controller to terminate the unlawful recordings.

The DPA extended the scope of the investigation (ex officio) against the controller. The DPA investigated all processing activities carried out by the controller with its CCTV systems and conducted an on-site inspection to the controller's property. The controller was using two CCTV systems that were identified within the investigation as Camera system No. 1 (consisting of 4 analogue cameras only providing live image) and Camera system No. 2 (consisting of 4 IP cameras recording image and audio) for which the recordings were said to be stored for three days by the controller.

The Camera system No. 1 showed views of the parking area within the property of the controller, a view from the gate to the building and to the reception area, and a small part of the backyard of the property, with a pavement leading to the reception area. The DPA noted that there were no recreational facilities located in these areas. The controller stated that the purposes of the CCTV in Camera sytem No. 1 were: 1) the protection of persons and property, 2) to detect possible infringements, 3) to catch a perpetrator in the act, and 4) to prevent infringing acts. The controller relied on legitimate interests under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") as a legal basis for the processing.

With regard to Camera system No. 2 showed views of: 1) a dining room, 2) a panoramic jacuzzi on the terrace - which previously showed a view of the data subject's property, but at the time of the DPA's on-site investigation, the controller had modified the angle view of the camera away from the data subject's property - 3) a patio, and 4) a reception desk. These cameras were motion-activated, recorded images, and some of them were placed with an angle of view to areas where the persons not only pass through but also rest and dine. Regardless of the DPA's request, the controller did not present any previous cases justifying the necessity for the use of the CCTV. The DPA considered that it was relevant whether any events had taken place in the past which would justify the placement of the cameras, as the data processing was more extensive compared to Camera system No 1. With regard to the previous monitoring of the data subject's property, the controller argued that it had had a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f), because it had legitimate interests for property protection purposes as it had accused the data subject’s husband for vandalism towards the fence separating the two properties.

### Holding

With regard to the Camera system No. 1 the DPA concluded that the operation of the cameras is appropriate for the purposes pursued and a necessary security measure for the objective pursued by the controller. Additionally, the DPA viewed that because the cameras within Camera system No. 1 only transmitted live image, and did not record any images that it constituted a significantly lower intrusion into the privacy of the persons concerned than if the video images were recorded.

With regard to Camera system No. 2, the DPA considered that due to the more extensive monitoring carried out by the cameras, it was necessary to assess each camera separately. The controller's balancing of interests test lacked individual assessments of the cameras, and only included general wording such as that valuable objects are monitored, so the interest of the controller is to safeguard the mentioned objects.

The objectives and purposes pursued by the controller for each camera were unclear to the DPA. The DPA also took in consideration the fact that the controller had not examined any alternative(s) for the use of a CCTV system that would not involve processing or the processing would be more limited in scope. The DPA emphasized, that in order to use CCTV systems on the basis of a legitimate interest, the processing must be proportionate to the aim pursued and compatible with the purposes pursued, necessary to achieve the purpose, and the design and implementation of the processing must take into account the reasonable expectations of the data subjects. Secondly, the DPA emphasized that the legitimate interests must be real and present at the time when the processing starts because processing cannot be based on a possible future interests.

With regard to the Camera system No. 2 recording also audio, the DPA viewed that the controller had not presented any reasons which would justify the necessity of audio recording, and emphasized that it is not a common practice in the case of CCTV surveillance of property. The DPA stated that data subjects cannot expect the cameras recording their voice and conversations, in particularly, when the cameras could also be activated by some small non-human movement and so start recording the conversations of persons who are not even in the camera's view (the DPA found examples of such situations from the CCTV recordings during its investigation).

The DPA furthermore found regarding Camera system No. 2, that the controller did not have legitimate interests for processing the personal data and held that the controller violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") with regard to 1) the camera installed in the dining room, 2) the camera monitoring the panoramic jacuzzi on the terrace, and 3) the camera facing the patio. With regard to 4) the camera above the reception desk, the DPA found that the controller had legitimate interests that were the protection of property and monitoring of cash payments. The DPA considered the previous monitoring of the data subject’s property as a serious interference with private life, and that only in very rare situations can there be legitimate interests that are not overruled. The DPA took in consideration, that the balancing of interests -test did not include the data subject’s property – only the controller’s property.

The Hungarian DPA held, firstly, that the controller 1) had unlawfully processed personal data of the data subject who initially complained about the processing in breach of [Article 6(1) GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") The DPA also prohibited the controller under [58(2)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR") from monitoring, in the future, the data subject's property. Secondly, the DPA held that the controller infringed 2) the principle of storage limitation under [Article 5(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") by not taking any measures to ensure that the recordings were deleted after set limitation of 3 days, 3) [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") by failing to inform the data subjects on the use of the camera surveillance in an easily accessible way, 4) [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") by failing to provided adequate information about the processing, 5) [Article 31 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_31_GDPR "Article 31 GDPR") by failing to comply with its duty to cooperate with the DPA as, in the DPA's view, the controller did not cooperate with the Authority during the procedure to the extent necessary, and in several cases provided false, incorrect or incomplete information.

The DPA fined the controller HUF 3 000 000 (three million forints).

        table and a refrigerator was visible from the side view.

(24) Respondent 1 explained to the Authority's question that he kept it in the dining area

        operation of the camera system is necessary, because there are several refrigerators that
        in which, on a general basis, hundreds of thousands of forints worth of alcoholic beverages are continuously stored
        drinks, other drinks and food. Further to the operation of the camera in the dining room

        as a reason, Respondent 1 submitted that the boarding house has a 4-star rating
        a professional expectation of a place of accommodation is to monitor the communal spaces with a camera a
        for the property and personal protection of guests. In support of the latter's statement

        you have not attached any documents.

(25) On the day of the on-site inspection conducted by the Authority on July 5, 2022, the angle of view of the camera
        has been modified compared to the status of December 2021, the camera has been rotated a
        towards reception. The area in front of the reception desk falls into his view of the room opening from there

        with its door and the short corridor leading to the dining room, the self-service counter and the coffee machine.
        Two of the tables in the dining room can be seen fully, one half, and the
        upper corner of refrigerator. The windows were replaced by a refrigerator containing only soft drinks

        for accommodation next to, from which - according to the inspection's testimony - the guests are free
        they could serve themselves. No other property fell into the camera's field of view.

(26) The second camera was installed on the elevated terrace part of the building, its type is TP-
        Link Tapo C310. This was the camera that recorded the infraction for vandalism,
        then the camera footage objected to by the Applicant used in criminal proceedings. July 2021
        On the 26th, according to the recording available to the Authority, the camera came into view

        A part of the Applicant's property with the willow tree, thus recording the likeness of the Applicant and his family,
        movement and their conversation.

(27) By December 2021, the angle of view of the camera had already been changed - about this, Respondent 1
        also declared to the Authority - he is no longer suitable for monitoring the Applicant's property, a
        on the camera image of the neighboring property on December 2, 2021, only one roof was visible -

        presumably the roof of the tool shed - and one of the foliage of the willow tree near the plot boundary
        part of. On December 7, 2021, the Company attached new pictures, at which time the roof part had not even fallen
        into the camera's field of view.

(28) During the on-site inspection, in addition to the above, the upper terrace and the
        jacuzzi in its entirety, depending on the layout, 2-4 outdoor chairs with a table, \[a
        accommodation\] pier.

(29) In his statement dated December 2, 2021, Respondent 1 explained with the angle of view of the cameras
        regarding the fact that none of them are aimed at the Applicant's property, not least because

        because the border between the properties is not in the line of the fence, but one meter from it, a
        In the direction of the applicant's property. However, there is no legal procedure in this regard
        initiated against the Applicant and her husband, he did not substantiate his statement,

        and according to the Applicant's statement, he is not aware of the plot boundary and the fence
        lines should not coincide.

                                                  7(30) The memory card of the camera on the jacuzzi terrace had 114 GB of data at the time of the inspection, the
        The earliest snapshot in the Snapshot directory was taken on March 24, 2022 at 10:28:34 a.m.
        last on the day of the inspection. At the time of the inspection, 473 MP4 files were stored on the camera's SD card

        it was a video file, 17 of which were 0 bytes in size, i.e. previously deleted or deleted recordings. The
        available files were all 256MB in size, SD card going back 19 days
        included recordings.

(31) In his statement dated December 2, 2021, Respondent 1 informed the Authority that the
        No. 2 want to install 2 more cameras for the camera system. Requested legal

        its representative stated in a statement dated June 8, 2022 that the camera system
        expansion and installation of the planned cameras did not take place. The Authority requested that a
        Requested 1 send pictures of the installed cameras in such a way that the cameras

        environment is also included. Among these recordings, there were recordings that, however,
        allowed us to conclude that the camera system had been expanded after all.

(32) During the on-site inspection held on July 5, 2022, the Authority was convinced that another 2

        a camera has been installed - 3rd camera - one of which monitors the reception desk from above - type
        TP-Link Tapo C200 – the L-shaped desk, the worker's chair and an additional chair.

(33) If an employee is behind the counter, it is suitable for observation, or
        records the conversations between the guests and the employee working at the reception. The Authority
        also found a recording that clearly shows the payment by bank card by a hotel guest

        your PIN and the camera also recorded the cash transactions.

(34) At the time of the inspection, this camera had 28 GB of 116 recordings in MP4 format in total
        there were 2 0-byte recordings, i.e. deleted or deleted recordings. On the SD card for 19 days

        recordings can be found retrospectively, each half has a uniform size of 256 MB
        was extensive.

(35) And the other camera - camera 4 - mainly on the door of one of the apartments opening from the courtyard, the
        to the front part with garden furniture, to the yard, the jacuzzi located there is approx. in half, a
        it is aimed at the bath tub, as well as the waterfront terrace and jetty and a part of Lake Balaton, type TP-

        Link Tapo C310. The memory card of this camera had a total of 28 GB of data at the time of the review

        card contained 110 video files in MP4 format going back 15 days, all in the same format

        It was 256 MB.

The purpose and legal basis of data processing through the camera system are the statements of Respondent 1

Based on

                                                   8(36) The Applicant 1 test of interests and the operation of the camera system, as well as the
        regulations on the use of recorded images - effective from July 1, 2021 - as well
        attached to the Authority's statement dated December 2, 2021, the latter being the document
        according to dated June 30, 2021.

(37) According to the camera regulations, the purpose of data management is the persons staying at the accommodation
        protection of life, physical integrity, personal freedom, as well as in the field of real estate

        staying persons, or assets owned or used by Respondent 1
        protection. The detection of legal violations, the perpetrator, was also named as a data management purpose
        prosecution, prevention of illegal acts, and also that the recordings with these

        be used as evidence in official proceedings.

(38) According to camera regulations, images are stored on the SD cards in the cameras

        for recording, which recordings in the absence of use by the Applicant 1, at most from the recording
        stored for 3 days, longer storage of recordings is not justified. The recordings are a
        according to the regulations, they are automatically deleted after 3 days.

(39) According to the camera regulations, the data management is based on the legitimate interests of Respondent 1, as well as
        in the case of employees, as part of the control of behavior related to the employment relationship
        Mt. 11/A. on the statutory authority based on paragraph (1) of §.

(40) To support the existence of a legitimate interest, Respondent 1 prepared an interest assessment test,
        and also recorded in the camera regulations that the data management implemented is to reach

        proportionally restricts the rights of the data subjects with the desired goal, since the angle of view of the cameras is set in such a way
        setting, that in any case it is a person or event to be protected
        be aimed at property. In addition, according to the camera regulations, the Data Controller is everything
        informs those concerned about the fact of camera surveillance and is essential

        about its circumstances, i.e. data processing does not affect the data subjects unexpectedly. Data management
        its duration is adjusted to the legal requirements, the only way to get to know the data is the regulations
        persons according to - Respondent 1's executive - are entitled in the cases specified therein -

        Asserting the legitimate interest of the respondent or exercising the rights of the affected parties - it may come to that
        beer.

(41) In the interest weighing test, as part of the identification of the existing legitimate interest, it was explained,
        that Respondent 1 has a legitimate interest in data management - which is the data subjects
        covers its image and sound - as it is of great value in the area open to guests
        valuables - e.g. the jacuzzi worth several million forints - have been installed, as well as the camera system

        its purpose is primarily asset protection and the protection of valuables. Data management is secondarily a
        serves to protect guests' values, person, and physical integrity. According to Respondent 1
        with the help of the camera system, you can ensure that you are not authorized to enter the accommodation area

        no persons may enter, no activity that endangers the security of property
        to continue.

(42) According to the weighing of interests test, if there is a decrease in the value of Respondent 1's valuables

        would occur or they would be appropriated, you can reveal it by viewing the recordings
        the reason for the decrease in value or the identity of the person who stole the valuable object, and the damage caused

                                                   9 can claim reimbursement. In the event of an accident, data management may contribute to the accident
        to clarify its circumstances.

(43) In response to the Authority's question as to whether property security had previously occurred in the area of the accommodation

        threatening event, Respondent 1 explained that the use of cameras is preventive
        device, so not from the point of view of the legality of data processing through cameras
        events that threaten property security in the relevant \[accommodation\] area

        list, as the camera system is intended to prevent such events.
        However, according to his statement, there were such incidents, but as an example, only the fence
        he mentioned his vandalism, he did not specifically name other events, their occurrence

        no supporting evidence was attached.

(44) In the weighing of interests test, it was explained in connection with the necessity of data management that

        in the event of damage, it can only be done as a result of viewing the camera footage
        to identify the perpetrator and to demand compensation from him. Respondent 1 explained
        furthermore, that the preparation and use of recordings is proportionate to the purpose of data management, since
        as a result of the data management, Respondent 1 can achieve the data management goal set by the data subjects

        without disproportionately invading your privacy. According to the weighing of interests test, a
        Respondent 1 has no alternative means or procedures at his disposal which
        you could achieve the purpose of data management without data management.

(45) In the interest weighing test, Respondent 1 interests and rights of the stakeholders
        during his identification, he recorded that the data management is informational for guests and other stakeholders

        has the right to self-determination, and within that the right to image and privacy
        effect. However, in his view, data management is not an internal, integral part of these
        limits, its effect is proportional to the achievement of the data management goal, it is absolutely necessary for that.
        The data is collected by Respondent 1 directly from the data subjects, which is clearly visible beforehand

        informs guests about data management on signs placed in
        the purpose and method of data management are widely and clearly understood."

(46) Respondent 1 in the weighing of interests test as the expected effect of data management
        he claimed that the injury to his property could be remedied. He also emphasized
        that those concerned do not lose control over their personal data, as the camera system

        they receive information about its operation, so the data management can have little effect on them. THE
        camera recordings will be viewed if the Applicant 1
        there is a decrease in the value of your assets or an asset is appropriated, and
        to discover the identity of the perpetrator or the circumstances of a possible accident

        it is necessary to review the recordings.

(47) As a result of the balance of interests test, Respondent 1 came to the conclusion that

        has a legitimate interest in data management and the camera recordings are justified for three days
        storage.

Information about data management

                                                 10(48) In relation to information on data management, the Respondent stated that it is clearly visible,

        He observes the land beyond the applicant's property, towards the Company, with a camera, basically

        based on property protection reasons."

(50) According to Respondent 1, no information was received after the oral information
        consent to data management on the part of the Applicant, but since it is based on his legitimate interest

        data management, it was not even necessary, as the restriction of rights was proportionate, he even explained that "a
        in our opinion, monitoring is lower than the properly necessary and proportionate level
        level, which is no better proof than that the level of observation was not suitable for

        To protect the company's property, which led to the police investigation \[due to vandalism\].
        proceedings."

(51) To support the fact that the information was provided, Respondent 1 attached an unknown person

        The voice of the manager of Respondent 1 can be heard, a discussion about waste transportation with a wheelbarrow
        during. During the discussion, it is said that “Through this camera you can see exactly that

        how many times has he passed in front of our yard." The attached recording does not reveal which one exactly
        the information referred to the camera, and that Respondent 1 during the conversation
        observed a public area or the Applicants' property with the referred camera. The Applicant 1

        stated that on the audio recording No. 1 camera system for a camera facing the parking lot
        referred to, which does not record recordings, only transmits a live image.

ARC. Decision

IV.1. Data management quality

(64) Based on the Applicant's request, the Authority notified both Respondent 1 and Respondent 2
        that an official data protection procedure was initiated against them upon request or ex officio. THE
        The authority's inquiries were received only by Respondent 1, and only he did so during the procedure
        statement, in all cases from Respondent 2 they came back with a not wanted signal

        Authority's orders, due to which the Authority imposed a procedural fine on Respondent 2.

(65) In his letter dated December 2, 2021, Respondent 1 informed the Authority that the

        only he is responsible for the examined data management and the cameras installed in the \[accommodation\].
        is considered a data controller.

(66) Based on the information revealed during the procedure and the statements of Respondent 1, the Authority
        states that it was Respondent 1 who determined the purpose and means of data management, he
        decided on the angle of view of the cameras, after the initiation of the procedure, he made changes to them,
        and the installation and operation of additional cameras on the property was also his decision. On this

        in addition, the indicated data management purposes were all intended to serve the interests of Respondent 1,
        since the primary purpose of data management is to protect the property of the accommodation and hotel guests
        has been flagged.

(67) It should also be noted that the document objected to by the Applicant, prepared on July 26, 2021
        camera footage was also saved by Respondent 1 and used against the Applicant's husband

        infraction and then criminal proceedings were initiated.

(68) During the procedure, the Applicant attached an audio recording, on which, according to his statement,

        The voice of Respondent 2 can be heard, on which the unidentified speaking party states that
        sees the image transmitted by cameras, including the Applicant and her husband, but the Authority does not
        had the opportunity to make sure that the other speaking party was Respondent 2 or someone else
        there is no evidence at the Authority's disposal that would prove beyond a doubt that a

        recordings were accessed by Applicant 2.

(69) In view of all of this, the Authority concludes that with regard to the examined data management

        Respondent 1 is considered a data controller. Due to this, as well as the fact that Applicant 2
        in the meantime, the property was sold and the new owner is on the stamp, the procedure with Respondent 2
        has become obsolete, since it does not affect the right or legitimate interest of the case, so the Authority a

        in relation to the Akr. Based on § 47, subsection (1), point c), the procedure is terminated.

                                                   19 IV. 2. Lawfulness of data management through the camera system - general practice

(70) Respondent 1 processed personal data using the two camera systems
        and considering that according to Article 4, point 1 of the GDPR, your natural personal voice,

        your image is personal data. The people involved can be identified in the recordings, as is well exemplified by
        They were also contained in the applicant's request. No. 1 camera system personal data, image and
        it does not record audio, but the image of the cameras and the person in their field of view

        transmits his natural personal image to the monitor located at the reception \[of the accommodation\],
        or, if it is switched on, to a monitor placed in the same room as the recording unit.
        Given that according to Article 4, point 2 of the GDPR, you are on personal data

        any operation performed on data files in an automated or non-automated manner or
        the totality of operations is considered data management, so no. 1. also through a camera system
        data management under the scope of the GDPR is implemented.

(71) No. 2 camera system cameras have a motion sensor and detect motion
        in this case, they record the image, voice, and activity of the persons concerned who are in their field of vision, that is
        conversations of data subjects, i.e. also through this camera system according to Article 4, point 2 of the GDPR

        implements data management Requested 1.

(72) The two camera systems and the legality of the data management carried out through them are the responsibility of the Authority

        it is examined separately, taking into account the differences in the monitored areas and the data management
        to its different nature.

No. 1 findings related to the camera system

(73) The 1st camera system consisting of 4 fixed, analog cameras - whose camera is marked CH1
        it does not work - it only broadcasts live images, the recordings shown by the cameras are not saved

        recording. The parking lot inside the \[accommodation\] and the building from the gate are in the view of the cameras
        next to it, the road leading to the reception falls into it, as well as a small part of the property's backyard, a
        with a sidewalk leading to reception. No recreational equipment was placed in this latter area

        for placement.

(74) Requested 1 uniform regulations for the two camera systems, as well as consideration of interests

        prepared a test, indicating the protection of personal and property as the purpose of data management -
        detection of possible violations of law, prosecution of the perpetrator, prevention of illegal acts -
        and as the legal basis for data management, he indicated his legitimate interest in the realization of this goal
        i.e. Article 6 (1) point f) of the GDPR.

(75) With reference to point f) of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR, the personal data is then legal
        management, if the data management is for the legitimate interests of the data controller or a third party

        necessary for its enforcement, unless they take priority over these interests
        concerned interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that protect personal data
        make it necessary, especially if the child is involved.

(76) The European Data Protection Board on the processing of personal data using video devices
        solo 3/2019. according to point 19 of guideline no. (hereinafter: Guidelines) is real
        and in a dangerous situation, the purpose of protecting property against burglary, theft or vandalism is a

                                                  20 may be considered a legitimate interest in video surveillance. For the legitimate interest indeed
        it must exist and actually exist at the time of data processing
        it cannot be theoretical, as the Court of Justice of the European Union stated in C-708/18. brought in case no
        he also stated in point 44 of his judgment.

(77) The Authority in the 1. does not consider it necessary in relation to the cameras of the camera system
        data management purposes and the proportionality of data management for each camera, since

        a uniform statement can be made about them.

(78) Requested 1, the Authority specifically for damage events that previously occurred at the accommodation

        he did not answer his relevant question in substance, did not give examples, did not prove cases, only
        stated that there were previous damage incidents. So Respondent 1 is legal
        has indicated a data management purpose, to which it may have a legitimate interest recognized by the Board,

        however, the existence of this legitimate interest was not factually supported or made probable.

(79) The Authority no. 1. in relation to the camera system, however, as existing even in its absence
        considers the legitimate interest related to data management. The reason for this is that No. 1 camera system

        all three working cameras are aimed at the property, the CH4 camera falls into the field of view
        partly the top of the railway soundproofing wall, but for monitoring movement on the street
        in a way suitable for personal identification, this camera is not suitable for both the distance and the

        camera resolution, both because of the viewing angle. The cameras monitor parts of the property that
        on which you can get to the area of the property on the one hand, and to the \[accommodation\] itself on the other hand,
        and where hotel guests can park their vehicles, and in the meantime on these a

        in these areas, hotel guests typically only pass through, not to rest or spend meaningful time
        they use them. Due to the location of these cameras - as they are also clearly visible from the street -
        have a deterrent effect against unauthorized entry into the property area, or
        against the commission of other crimes against property. Based on all this, the Authority

        determines that the operation of these cameras is appropriate for the purpose to be achieved and
        is considered a necessary safety measure.

(80) In addition, the cameras only transmit live images, no recording takes place, which is what it is
        it realizes a significantly lower degree of interference in the private sphere of stakeholders than if row
        their personal data would be recorded. Based on all of this, the Authority concludes that 1.

        s. data management through a camera system is suitable for achieving the goal, data management
        its scope is proportional to the goal to be achieved, so no. 1. realized by means of a camera system
        data management is legal, it complies with the regulations of the GDPR.

No. 2 findings related to the camera system

(81) Due to the more extensive data management carried out with this camera system, the Authority considers it necessary

        considers that it should be considered separately for each camera that it is
        data processing carried out by them is necessary, as well as the rights and freedoms of the data subjects
        does it limit proportionally.

(82) As the Authority explained earlier in its decision, asset protection is contingent
        enabling the subsequent proof of a legitimate data management purpose in connection with damage events

                                                 21 in general, but this alone is not enough for data management
        to its legality. In order to conduct video surveillance on the basis of a legitimate interest
        data management must be legal, the data management must be proportionate to the goal to be achieved, and the goal
        it must be necessary to achieve it, as well as the planning and implementation of data management

        the reasonable expectations of those concerned must be taken into account \[GDPR (47)
        recital\].

(83) In the interest assessment test attached by Respondent 1, the individual was not described
        in relation to cameras separately, that for data management the Respondent 1 exactly
        what legitimate interest it has - beyond the general wording that for the guests

        valuable valuables were placed in an open area, i.e. the camera system
        purpose is primarily asset protection - what are the circumstances that data management
        make it necessary, or the rights of the data subjects have not been separately identified, as well as

        their reasonable expectations regarding data management.

(84) The Authority in accordance with No. 2 regarding the cameras of the camera system, he refers back to his earlier statement,
        that the legitimate interest must be real and existing at the start of data processing,

        data management cannot be continued based on a possible future interest. As the
        As explained above by the Authority, Respondent 1 did not, despite the Authority's express request
        presented previous cases that would prove the need for camera data management,

        whose No. 2 is important in relation to the camera system, since they are on the one hand
        they are activated for movement, the completed recordings are recorded, on the other hand \[the accommodation\] is individual
        were placed in his premises and in his yard with a viewing angle setting that

        areas, the people concerned not only pass through, but rest and eat there, i.e. here
        in the case of cameras, it is actually important whether there have been previous events that
        which would justify the placement of the cameras, since the data management is good for them
        wider than No. 1 regarding the camera system.

(85) Regarding the necessity of operating the camera system, it should be noted that a
        according to available information, Respondent 1 did not check that the cameraman

        is there an alternative to data management that is not personal or less personal
        by handling data. In addition, it was revealed during the evidence procedure conducted by the Authority
        based on the circumstances, it cannot be declared that there is no alternative to No. 2. camera system

        to data management carried out through, or it could not be continued in a way that is less
        impairs the right of data subjects to protect their personal data.

(86) Regarding the necessity of data management, Respondent 1 also referred to the fact that a

        professional expectations for accommodations with four-star pension certification a
        surveillance of public spaces with a camera. Respondent 1 did not respond to the Authority's question
        stated what classification system requires this for accommodations, merely

        he referred to sector expectations, and to the fact that all hotels and pensions operate
        camera system. According to the photograph taken at the inspection, the accommodation is Panzió Nemzeti
        has a certification Trademark that is valid until 2024. The accommodation service

        therefore, the Authority considers professional expectations as one of the reasons for the operation of the camera system
        does not consider it acceptable, as well as the argument that other accommodations

        carry out similar data management.

(87) Respondent 1 mentioned in the attached interest assessment test among the processed data that

        the cameras also record sound, but it was not covered at all in the consideration of interests test
        to why the audio recording is kept in order to achieve the indicated data management purposes
        necessary, and why you do not consider the marked available without audio recording
        data management purpose. According to the Authority's point of view, this is different from image recording

        data management, the legality of which and the legitimate interest attached to it should have been separate
        prove to Respondent 1 during the procedure. However, Respondent 1 did not during the procedure
        presented circumstances that would support the need for audio recording.

(88) The Authority's position is that it causes more serious damage to the private sector if the cameras
        in addition, sound is also recorded, especially considering that the sound recording cannot be viewed

        as a common practice in the case of asset protection camera surveillance, so it is
        in the absence of information, those concerned cannot expect the cameras to be their likeness
        also records their voices and conversations. This is especially true when the cameras
        they are also activated for some small, non-human movement, and thus the conversation of such persons

        are also recorded by those who are not in the camera's field of view, to which the SD-
        The Authority also found an example among the recordings on the cards (record number \[…\]).

(89) Based on all of this, the Authority concludes that the 2. no. with the cameras of the camera system
        audio recording is illegal and violates Article 6 (1) of the GDPR.

(90) Further circumstances of data management, the proportionality and necessity of data management, and thus
        the legality of the Authority in the 2. no. in relation to some cameras of the camera system a
        further examined separately, due to the differences in the areas observed by them.

A camera located in the dining room

(91) In the dining room, Respondent 1 considers the camera system necessary

        operation, because there are several refrigerators in which, on a general basis,
        they continuously store hundreds of thousands of forints worth of alcoholic drinks, other drinks and
        foods.

(92) During the on-site inspection, the Authority established that the camera located in the dining room
        only one refrigerator falls into his field of vision - only the corner of it when it is closed -,

                                                 23 in which only non-alcoholic soft drinks were placed during the inspection, and of which a
        guests served themselves freely. The alcoholic beverages Requested 1 is a smaller one
        stored in a refrigerator, which is protected by a padlock.

(93) Due to the placement of the camera, however, not only this one piece of refrigerator falls into the

        into the camera's field of view, but the tables placed there, at which the guests are
        they complicate their meals.

(94) According to the Authority's point of view, the implemented data management is not proportionate to the desired goal

        for property protection purposes, since, on the one hand, contrary to the claim of Respondent 1, the camera
        hundreds of thousands of forints worth of food was not stored in the refrigerator within sight
        or alcoholic beverages, on the other hand, protecting the contents of the refrigerators is simple
        would be with the lock installed on the coolers - as is the case with the cooler containing small alcohols

        also happened - or by placing a lockable refrigerator in advance, i.e. it is not for the goal to be achieved
        need for data management.

(95) In relation to the secondary purpose - that is, if there is any decrease in assets

        causative event, so that the circumstances of the case can be revealed - Applicant 1 no
        made it probable that this is a real interest existing at the time of data processing, i.e. that
        you can realistically expect to damage the refrigerator or any food in it

        to steal a drink. The Authority further notes that in the event that the Applicant
        1 would have proved that he has a legitimate interest in the camera monitoring of the refrigerators, so
        even in that case, it would have been possible to place the camera in such a way, and the angle of view would have been such
        to monitor only the refrigerator and not the entire refrigerator

        dining room, subject to Article 5 (1) point c) of the GDPR.

(96) The Authority also notes that in the present case, the current position and angle of view of the camera
        in addition, he would not consider it sufficient if Respondent 1 were to mask the room outside the refrigerator

        parts, as the camera in its current position would create a sense of observation in this
        also in the case of those involved, who would not be able to ascertain in any way that
        the camera image has actually been masked.

(97) The Data Protection Board 3/2019. s. guidelines and recital (47) of the GDPR

        consideration of the interests of the data controller and the rights and freedoms of the data subjects
        the reasonable expectations of the stakeholders must be taken into account. According to the Guidelines, it is
        reasonable expectations of stakeholders should not be determined subjectively, but according to the fact that

        whether an objective third party can reasonably calculate and infer in the given situation
        to be observed.

(98) According to paragraphs (37)-(38) of the Guidelines, those concerned may expect not to be observed

        them in public places, especially if these places are typically for recuperation and rest
        and used for recreational activities as well as in places where individuals
        stay and communicate, for example in lounges, at restaurant tables, in parks,
        in cinemas and fitness facilities. In this case, the interests or rights of the data subject and

        your freedoms often take precedence over the legitimate interests of the data controller.

(99) Hostel guests typically come \[to the accommodation\] to relax, have breakfast there,
        they talk, organize their day. During these activities, their observation and

                                                 24 in particular, the recording of their conversation is particularly disadvantageous for those involved and in general
        it is not necessary for the purpose indicated by Respondent 1. The Guidelines emphasize that it is
        signs informing the person concerned about video camera surveillance are irrelevant
        when establishing the objective expectations of the stakeholders.

        Consequently, in connection with the data processing carried out by the camera placed in the restaurant
        you cannot rely on the fact that one has been placed on the side of the self-service counter
        area board observed with a camera, and especially not because of the fact of audio recording

        Respondent 1 did not draw the attention of those concerned anywhere.

(100) During the inspection, the Authority made a copy of a recording on which, on the one hand,
        workers packing up and cleaning after a meal can be seen, on the other hand, one

        a hotel guest sitting at one of the tables with a laptop, working, talking on the phone, then heading for the heat
        she stands up with respect and fans herself with her skirt while walking in such a way that a
        the recording also shows her underwear or the bottom of her swimsuit (video file named \[…\]). All of these
        on the basis of which it can be stated that the hotel guests did not and do not reasonably count

        they could expect to be watched in the dining room.

(101) The Authority finds that Respondent 1 illegally operates the camera in the restaurant
        and illegally observes the hotel guests staying there, eating and conversing, thereby

        in violation of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR.

A camera monitoring the panoramic jacuzzi on the terrace

(102) The necessity of the camera directed mainly at the jacuzzi was justified by Respondent 1 by saying that the

        jacuzzi is worth several million forints, so data management is necessary to protect your property.

(103) The camera is mainly aimed at the jacuzzi, but e.g. shouting from the yard to the terrace

        also records (\[…\]; \[…\]).

(104) In view of what was explained in the previous subsection, the Authority does not consider it to be the desired goal

        proportional to the fact that Applicant 1 typically sees hotel guests in bathing suits, resting,
        he observes and records them while relaxing. There are several couples in the recordings,
        who hug each other, kiss in the jacuzzi, others are naked or half-naked
        they bathe, take pictures of themselves in bathing suits, and children also use the jacuzzi

        (\[…\]; \[…\]; \[…\]). Based on the recordings, the people involved did not count at all, and reasonably not
        they could also count on being told about them while using the jacuzzi, while relaxing
        intimate moments are recorded. According to the Authority's point of view, it may play a role in this

        also that Respondent 1 also sells packages that include a private panoramic jacuzzi
        use is promised, which may give those concerned the impression that the panorama is a Jacuzzi
        they are actually alone while using the jacuzzi, no one is using them

        disturbs them, which includes not observing them while bathing
        with a camera.

(105) The Authority considers it necessary to state here again that the sign observed by the camera
        according to the Guidelines, its location is not relevant when determining that it is
        stakeholders, what their expectations may be objectively. Also, the area monitored by the camera

                                                  Based on 25 signals, those involved could not even expect that the camera would not only transmit live images,
        but also records the recordings.

(106) The Authority also does not consider the argument regarding the top of the jacuzzi to be acceptable, since

        the image of the camera cannot be followed live via a monitor in the accommodation, as in No. 1.
        in the case of a camera system, and for viewing the recorded camera images, Applicant 1
        according to his statement, it will only take place in justified cases, with the recording of minutes - log files

        in its absence, the Authority could not be convinced of this - i.e. the statement of Respondent 1
        system established according to is not suitable for the Applicant to check that the
        have guests put the top of the jacuzzi back on.

(107) Based on all of this, the Authority concludes that Respondent 1 illegally operates the
        a camera aimed at the jacuzzi and illegally records the voice and image of the persons concerned there,

        activities, thereby violating Article 6 (1) point f) of the GDPR.

The camera facing the inner courtyard

(108) The camera facing the inner courtyard on the door of one of the apartments opening from the courtyard, the one in front
        partly with garden furniture, to the yard, the jacuzzi located there is approx. in half, on the bath tub,
        and it is directed to the waterfront terrace and pier and a part of Lake Balaton.

(109) According to Respondent 1, the purpose of monitoring the inner courtyard with a camera is to protect property,
        in the event of a possible theft or break-in, there is a high chance of being identified by the cameras facing the inner courtyard

        they know the perpetrator of the crime.

(110) The Authority does not dispute that a certain degree of monitoring of the inner courtyard may be necessary
        prevention of potential crimes against property, or in the event of their occurrence

        in order to reveal them, as the Authority in no. 1 camera system marked CH2
        he also explained about his camera. A significant difference between the viewing angles of the two cameras is that
        No. 1 the rear camera of the camera system, facing the inner courtyard, does not record footage on the one hand,

        on the other hand, it is directed only to the part of the sidewalk where the entrance to the accommodation is located, and it is a thin one
        lane from the part of the yard next to the sidewalk. In these areas - as the Authority previously did
        also described - hotel guests typically only pass through this area to rest,

        not used for recreation. On the other hand, no. 2 camera system for the inner courtyard
        only areas where the hotel guests are in the field of view of the camera
        they rest and relax, in many cases in bathing suits, e.g. Jacuzzi, hot tub. Also on camera
        the movements and activities of hotel guests who are in the camera's field of view can be followed

        they stayed in the second apartment, who usually use the one located in front of the apartment
        also garden furniture, they talk and relax there.

(111) The Authority's position is that at the time of the inspection, the camera's field of view is much wider
        made monitoring possible, as was necessary to achieve the data management goal, since
        for property protection purposes, only the entrance leading to the reception of the accommodation would be sufficient

        camera surveillance, which does not require the hotel guests to be at rest
        observation. In addition, according to the Authority's point of view, the concerned parties reasonably do not
        they can count on video and audio recording of their movements in the hotel yard,

                                                  26 as it is an area for recreation. Based on all of this, the Authority determines,
        that Respondent 1 is illegally fixing the inner yard beyond the necessary extent
        with a camera aimed at the voice, likeness, and activity of the data subjects, in violation of the GDPR
        Article 6, paragraph 1, point f).

The camera above the reception desk

(112) The camera above the reception desk captures the reception desk from above, the person behind it
        employee or employees, or the cabinet placed next to the wall, as well as the
        hotel guests, whose faces are only visible when they are very close

        they go to the counter and lean over it a little or lean on it, if someone just
        he passes by the counter, his face is not visible in the footage. The store manager is in the camera's field of view
        monitor used by is not included.

(113) According to the statement of Respondent 1 dated August 28, 2022, the reception desk with a camera
        monitoring also has the purpose of asset protection, since according to his statement, the guests
        they regularly pay in cash. This statement was copied by the Authority during the inspection

        - 19 days - supported by camera footage.

(114) In view of this, the Authority does not consider data processing to be excessive, and considers that the

        Claimed 1's legitimate interest as there is actually cash flow at the front desk where
        the money box serving as the house cash register was also placed. Furthermore, the reception desk is not
        it is located in a closed space, it cannot be fenced off separately, as the reception also opens to an apartment

        from the side.

(115) According to the Authority's point of view, from the business manager's job and the nature of the job
        therefore, the camera above the reception desk is not suitable for monitoring the employee, or a

        to measure his performance, since the tasks of the business manager are not limited to those that
        you must finish sitting at your desk.

(116) Based on this, the Authority concludes that Respondent 1 legally installed the camera above the reception
        is operated, its legitimate interest – asset protection, monitoring of cash payments –
        data processing carried out in order to enforce

        typically the business manager's right to protect his personal data, the restriction does not
        can be considered excessive.

IV.3. Violation of the principle of limited storage capacity

(117) According to Article 5 (1) of the GDPR, personal data must be stored in such a form
        to happen, which identifies the data subjects only for the purposes of processing personal data
        for the time required to reach it.

(118) According to the statement of Respondent 1, the purpose of data management through the camera system is a
        it was property protection. In this regard, the camera regulation 6.2. for recording in point
        it was decided that, in the absence of use of the recorded images, the Applicant 1, at most a
        it is stored for 3 days from the date of recording, as the general person and

                                                  27, compared to property protection purposes, no special reason arises, which has a longer content
        would justify data retention. In the absence of use, the recordings will be on the 3rd day from the recording
        are automatically deleted.

(119) According to the Authority's point of view, the retention period of the camera recordings is adequate, as it was intended to be

        has been defined proportionally to the purpose in the camera regulations, since if it is of any kind
        a crime against or other event involving property damage occurs, within 3 days
        Respondent 1 will certainly detect and take appropriate action on the recordings

        in order to save.

(120) However, the Respondent did not take any measures against the provisions of the camera regulations
        in order for the recordings to be deleted after 3 days, he did not apply such a setting
        on the cameras, and placed relatively large SD cards in the cameras, which thus

        they can store much more than 3 days of recordings.

(121) At the time of the inspection, no. 2 camera system directed to the inner courtyard and in the dining room
        on the SD card of its cameras for 15 days, while for the jacuzzi and the reception

        the SD cards of the cameras had recordings going back 19 days.

(122) The Authority considers these retention periods neither necessary nor proportionate
        in relation to a camera system operated for property protection purposes, therefore it states that
        Respondent 1 violated the limited liability under Article 5 (1) point (e) of the GDPR

        storability principle.

IV.4. Information about camera data management

(123) In the case of data management through a camera system, the data controller is the personal data
        is collected from the data subject, therefore the obligation to provide information according to Article 13 of the GDPR is sufficient
        to the data controller.

(124) In relation to the information, the Authority primarily reviewed the website of Respondent 1, where separately
        there is no data management information or data protection tab. By clicking on the Reservation menu item
        at the bottom of the page there is a clickable menu item called Data Management Policy, however

        it redirects to the GTC.

(125) In point \[...\] of the Terms and Conditions on the website, under the heading Obligations of Guests, call the

        the attention of guests and potential guests that it operates a camera system \[a
        accommodation\] area: "\[…\]" In addition, they can be found in point \[...\] of the General Terms and Conditions with data management
        related information, e.g. newsletter subscription, transfer of personal data request

        for authority, etc.

(126) During the inspection, the Authority came to the conclusion that it was not found anywhere in the building
        detailed for posting, containing all the conditions of camera data management

        information sheet. The camera policy was found at the reception, although it was not posted,
        therefore, guests cannot access it without a special request. Area under surveillance
        sign was placed in several places - at the entrance to the jacuzzi and the self-service in the dining room

        on the side of the counter - however, the boards did not contain any additional information beyond the fact of data management.

                                                  28 In addition, information was not posted or placed in any other way in the rooms
        about data management through a camera system.

(127) As a result, the Authority disputes the interest assessment test made by Respondent 1

        statement that "guests are informed on signs placed in a clearly visible place
        on data management, on the basis of which the purpose and method of data management are broadly and clearly defined
        understandable."

(128) The Article 29 working group on transparency under Regulation EU 2016/679
        according to its guidelines (WP260), information is easily accessible if the person concerned

        you don't have to search for the information; it must be immediately visible to him that the information
        where and how it can be reached, for example by providing information directly, to the data subjects
        directing to information or clearly marking the path leading to information. The

        according to point 11 of the guideline, those data controllers who have a website know that
        make information about data management easily accessible, if it is on their website
        are made accessible. Direct to this data protection declaration, information
        link must be clearly visible on all pages of the website.

(129) Respondent 1 did not post detailed information on camera data management on its website
        information, as well as information related to data management, was not separated by it

        from GTC, i.e. did not draw the attention of hotel guests or potential hotel guests to the
        on the website that a camera surveillance system is operating in the area \[of the accommodation\], that a
        can already count on data management when booking, and that hotel guests need

        in the event that the staff of the accommodation can easily obtain information about data management
        without involving. In addition, Respondent 1 did not have an easy time at the accommodation
        made the information about camera data management available, did not post it, or
        placed one copy of each in the rooms, i.e. in the absence of active behavior of the affected person

        the essential elements of data management were not available to those concerned. Based on this, the
        Authority states that it is related to data management, according to Article 13 of the GDPR
        Respondent 1 did not make information easily accessible to any person concerned,

        thereby violating Article 12 (1) of the GDPR.

(130) The Authority also notes that the Guidelines per se apply to camera data management

        does not consider the posting of warning signs to be a sufficient measure, if the additional
        does not contain minimum information: identity of data controller, purpose of data processing, rights of data subjects,
        information about the biggest effects of data management, e.g. data controller for data management
        its legitimate interest. It must also include the availability of the complete prospectus. On this

        the signs posted by Respondent 1 did not meet this requirement.

(131) Respondent 1 does not have a separate data management information sheet for camera data management

        information regarding its circumstances is contained in the camera regulations
        According to Respondent 1's statement dated December 2, 2022. The camera policy is
        In connection with data management, there is also a lot of wrong or difficult to interpret information

        contain. On the one hand, text formulation and accurate knowledge of camera images
        in the absence of 3.1. The figure placed in point is not suitable for the people concerned
        get to know the scope of data management and the viewing angle of the cameras, on the one hand, its small size

                                                 29, on the other hand, because the function of the rooms was not indicated on the drawing. The policy
        on the other hand, it does not mention that the cameras marked in blue - these are the cameras that
        In December 2021 and June 2022, according to the statements of Respondent 1, not yet
        were put into operation, while they were already being installed when the second declaration was made

        were installed and operated - what the stakeholders need to know.

(132) In relation to the scope of data management, neither the camera regulations nor the posted signs

        they provide information that the cameras also record sound, which is part of the data management
        a very significant, not-to-be-ignored circumstance, to which, moreover, the affected parties
        they could not reasonably count, since there is no particularly clear reason which

        would support the need for audio recording and the general practice of data controllers
        in case of operation of cameras, that they do not record sound.

(133) In point 4 of the camera regulations, Respondent 1 stated that "The cameras
        in monitored areas, the purpose of camera surveillance is with less restrictive measures
        was not available.", even though Respondent 1 did not carry out the consideration of interests at all
        separately in relation to the camera, on the other hand, on the merits according to the weighing of interests test

        it did not even examine the possibility of alternative solutions, i.e. data management
        it gave incorrect information regarding its inevitability and its proportionality
        to those concerned.

(134) The 4.2. point, it is also mentioned that the duration of data management is required by law
        adjusts, and then further refers to point 6, according to which the recorded recordings are not used

        store it for up to 3 days and the recordings are automatically deleted on the 3rd day. On the one hand,
        of 2005 on personal and property protection and the rules of private detective activity.
        year CXXXIII. the rule of the law - 31/A. Section (2) - which was determined in 3 working days
        and the duration of storage of camera recordings, expired on April 26, 2019,

        i.e. wrongly informed those concerned about the duration of the storage of the camera recordings
        determined by law. On the other hand, contrary to what was stated in the information sheet, he did not
        measures to ensure that camera recordings are deleted within 3 days, a

        cameras have large SD cards - 32 and 128 GB - and the review
        according to his testimony, the recordings were available 15-19 days ago.

(135) The Authority further notes that in the camera regulations, the Authority until September 1, 2020
        valid contact information has been indicated, although the regulations came into effect on July 1, 2021
        into force.

(136) Based on all of this, the Authority concludes that Respondent 1 violated Article 13 of the GDPR
        Paragraphs (1)-(2), since the camera regulations, which also serve as information, incorrectly, or
        misleadingly informed those concerned about the handling of their personal data.

IV.5. Obligation to cooperate with the Authority

(137) According to Article 31 of the GDPR, the data controller, in the course of carrying out his duties, shall communicate with the supervisory authority

        - based on its inquiry - cooperates.

                                                  30(138) According to the Authority, Respondent 1 did not cooperate with the Authority during the procedure
        provided untrue, incorrect or incomplete information to the extent necessary, in several cases a
        For inquiries from the authority as follows.

(139) Respondent 1 stated in his statement dated December 2, 2021 that July 2021

        The recording made on the 26th, which was affected by the Applicant's request, is not available to you, and then that
        nevertheless sent it to the Police Department on January 4, 2022, and presented the technical
        as an expert on March 1, 2022. When the Authority asked about this contradiction,

        Respondent 1's legal representative stated that Respondent 1 made a false statement, which
        explained that the video was no longer available on the camera software because the SD
        the recordings are automatically deleted from the card, however, the recording is expressed by the police

        was saved at his request, and presumably about this saving, the manager of the Respondent a
        he forgot when making the statement. In this case, according to the Authority's opinion, at the latest
        On January 4, 2022, you should have noticed that the recording was still available to you, and that
        then he should have sent it to the Authority. In contrast, his statement is not

        amended, the recording was not released by the Authority's order, which the Authority finally a
        he obtained a recording from the Police Department, which recording was requested by the Applicant
        was of particular importance from the point of view, since without it the Authority would not have been able to

        without a doubt, make sure of the camera's setting and angle of view.

(140) On December 2, 2021, Respondent 1 stated that the cameras marked in blue on the floor plan
        they are not working yet, they are only planning to put them into operation. On May 17, 2022, in its order a

        The authority asked whether the planned cameras had been put into operation
        Respondent 1 received a negative response on June 7, 2022. In contrast, Respondent 1
        to the same statement he has already attached photographs based on which
        it could be established that the planned cameras were installed on the property, which a

        were already in operation at the time of the inspection, i.e. Respondent 1 did not provide complete information
        about the data management carried out by him at the request of the Authority.

(141) Respondent 1 also gave evasive answers to a number of the Authority's questions, e.g. what kind of

        classification system requires the operation of a camera system for accommodation facilities
        according to his point of view. He also did not inform the Authority that it was sold by Respondent 2
        property on which \[the accommodation\] is located, although he was aware that in the proceedings
        Respondent 2 is also a customer.

(142) Based on these, the Authority concludes that Respondent 1 violated Article 31 of the GDPR.

(143) In its order dated November 8, 2022, the Authority imposed a procedural fine on Applicant 1,
        because, despite a second invitation, he did not provide information that during the period under review,

        How many people stayed \[at the accommodation\] between July 2021 and October 2022, in the absence of
        the Authority was unable to determine the number of those affected. As a result, the Authority on this
        evaluates the behavior as contrary to Article 31 of the GDPR, however, during the imposition of the fine, it already
        does not take into account the fact that he was sanctioned earlier during the procedure.

IV.6. Assessment of the Applicant's request

(144) In its application for the data protection authority procedure, the Applicant requested that the Authority establish

        and that the cameras installed and operated by the Applicants at \[accommodation\] are illegal
                                                  They carry out 31 data management. He requested that, for this reason, he prohibit the access to the Applicant's property
        the continuation of surveillance with a camera, the recording of the observed and order it
        termination, as well as the destruction of illegally made recordings, and also prohibit it
        enjoin the Respondents from further infringement and enjoin the Respondents, as well as impose

        out data protection fine.

(145) The on-site inspection conducted by the Authority on July 5, 2022 without prior notification

        established that at the time of the inspection the cameras of both camera systems were as such
        setting that they were not suitable for the Applicant's property, the applicant and his family
        to monitor your activities on the property. The Applicant is dated July 11, 2022

        in response to his statement, the Authority considers it necessary to point out that the 1. no. camera system
        4.'s camera - as it was already recorded earlier in the factual part of the decision
        – is not suitable for monitoring the Applicant's property, only the

        The property used by applicant 1 and the row of fences between the two fences can be seen.

(146) The recording related to the damage to the fence can be found in no. 2. belonging to a camera system, a
        on the terrace, it was recorded by the camera placed above the jacuzzi, which on July 26, 2021

        according to the available recordings, it was determined that the Applicant was suitable
        his property, to observe the activities there, as the two fell into his field of vision
        fence separating the plot, as well as a small part of the Applicant's garden with the willow tree and Lake Balaton.

(147) According to Respondent 1, the monitoring of the Applicant's property with a camera,
        and the legal basis for recording what happened there (audio and image recording) is Article 6 (1) of the GDPR

        he had a legitimate interest according to paragraph f), which is his property, or Respondent 2
        related to the protection of his property. He further explained that, in his opinion, the Applicant
        monitoring of his property did not reach the required level, since on July 26, 2021
        the camera did not record the events that took place in a way that left no doubt

        to determine whether the Applicant's husband damaged the fence or the fence
        its concrete element cracked due to a construction error.

(148) The Authority does not share the position of Respondent 1. According to the position of the Authority, a
        it is considered a serious interference with private life if someone destroys another person's property,
        continuously monitors your movements and activities on the property. Camera surveillance

        only in the rarest of cases can it extend beyond the boundary of its own property, and in such cases it is
        legitimate interest in data management and the restriction of rights implemented on the basis thereof
        it must be proportionate to the objective to be achieved.

(149) According to the Authority's point of view, the continuous monitoring of a part of the Applicant's property, a
        Recording the movements, activities and conversations of the applicant and his family there -
        with particular regard to the fact that it is a property on the shores of Lake Balaton, i.e. the Applicant and

        her family is likely to be there often in bathing suits, as on July 26, 2021
        it was also done in the recording - it cannot be considered proportionate as indicated by the Applicant 1
        for property protection purposes. The circumstance to be taken into account in relation to the proportionality of data management is

        also that the Applicant and his family did not know that Applicant 1
        equipped camera is also partly aimed at the area of their property, which is obviously recreational
        purposes are used. Information referred to by Respondent 1, of which audio recording

                                                  32 is attached, even though it cannot be considered adequate information, since it is another, no. 1.
        related to a camera belonging to a camera system, or the appropriate information in itself
        nor would it make the data processing carried out by Respondent 1 legal.

(150) During the procedure, Respondent 1 attached a general interest assessment test, which
        however, it only covered the data management carried out in the hotel area - not enough for that
        with detail - it is not mentioned that the camera surveillance covers a

        Also for the applicant's property. As Respondent 1 admitted, on camera
        implemented data management was not suitable for achieving the goal, it did not serve a clear purpose
        as evidence in infringement and then criminal proceedings regarding vandalism. THE

        However, the authority does not draw the same conclusion from this as Respondent 1, that a
        the level of monitoring was too low, but that the data management was not suitable for the purpose
        access, and was also disproportionately limited by the personal data of the Applicant and his family

        their right to protection and to the inviolability of their private sphere.

(151) Based on all of this, the Authority concludes that Respondent 1 unlawfully observed the
        Applicant's property and unlawfully handled the personal data of the Applicant and his family,

        thereby violating Article 6 (1) of the GDPR.

(152) In its application, the Applicant requested that the Authority oblige the Respondents to unlawfully

        to delete recorded recordings. The Authority is only aware of one recording
        on which the Applicant appears, and this was taken at the fence on July 26, 2021
        camera recording, which he initiated as evidence for the vandalism

        used in criminal proceedings. For this use, according to the Authority's opinion
        Respondent 1 had a legitimate interest, as the admission was for the enforcement of his legal requirements and
        it was used for the purpose of protection, which is a legitimate interest also named by the GDPR. The vandalism
        in the meantime, the infringement or criminal proceedings initiated due to the Police Department have been completed

        terminated the procedure in the absence of a crime, and Respondent 2 was aggrieved by the decision
        against which he had no legal recourse. Consequently, the procedures in which the recording
        were used as evidence, they are no longer used in the present proceedings

        He requested, but the Police Department made the recording available to the Authority, that
        Respondent 1 did not attach it as evidence to the Authority's request. As a result, the
        Authority states that since the procedures where Applicant 1 as evidence

        used the recording depicting the Applicant and his family members, they have been legally terminated, so it is
        the purpose of data management has ceased, the legitimate interest in data management no longer exists.

(153) According to the statement of Respondent 1, the representation of the Applicant was carried out accordingly

        to delete camera recordings.

IV.6. The Applicant's request for the imposition of a fine

(154) The Authority rejects the Applicant's request for the imposition of a data protection fine, as this
        the application of a legal consequence does not directly affect the rights or legitimate interests of the Applicant,
        such a decision of the Authority does not create any right or obligation for him, as a result

        with regard to the application of this legal consequence falling within the scope of public interest enforcement - a
        regarding the imposition of fines - the Applicant is not considered a customer under Art. Section 10 (1)

                                                  33, so there is no place to submit an application in this regard, the submission is based on this
        part cannot be interpreted as a request.

IV.7. Motions for Evidence

(155) In the Applicant's submission to the Authority on December 8, 2022, a large number

        made a comment and motion for evidence.

(156) The Applicant made a motion for proof that the Authority should contact \[…\]
        Police Department, and obtain by the executive of Respondent 1 on March 30, 2021 the
        the document of her report against her husband, as well as the report of the arriving police officers
        about on-site action. He considered this necessary in order to provide support
        avoid that the camera systems operated by Respondent 1 during this period
        cameras were set up in such a way that they were suitable for public areas

        for observation. According to the Authority's point of view, this evidentiary motion is so hypothetical
        refers to illegal behavior which, based on the Applicant's request, did not occur before
        the subject of the procedure, and the submission of a motion for proof in itself cannot be considered a request
        extension, and the Applicant did not make it likely that this data management
        in respect of which he is considered to be affected, only during the conversation referred to by him
        statements that her husband can be seen in the broadcast image of a camera.

(157) In addition, the Authority ex officio fully examined the
        The data processing carried out by means of camera systems operated by Respondent 1 was examined
        period, an on-site inspection was conducted in the case, the facts are the request
        revealed to the extent necessary for assessment and decision-making. The position of the Authority
        taking into account the findings made above and the provisions of the statutory part,
        there is no need to contact the \[…\] Police Department, thus this evidence motion
        ignores.

(158) As an additional motion for evidence, the applicant requested that the Authority make new statements
        obtain from Respondent 1 in relation to the audio recording you have attached for the purpose of
        certifies that the Applicant has been informed about the operation of the camera system, and a
        In relation to Respondent 1's claim that the fence is not on the real plot boundary. The Authority a
        in terms of clarifying the facts, Respondent 1 does not consider this necessary
        his statement in the questions given that he did not accept it in the attached audio recording
        audible conversation as adequate information about data management, nor the Respondent 1

        did not support his argument regarding the plot boundary, so these statements are further
        the examination of his circumstances would only hinder the completion of the procedure, the disclosure of the facts
        and they are not important from the point of view of

(159) The Applicant also initiated as a proof motion that the Authority is newer
        invites Respondent 1 to make a statement in No. 2 for camera system recordings
        regarding access. According to the Authority's point of view, not for the assessment of the Applicant's request
        it is necessary for the Authority to accurately reveal to the minute that the applicant's 1 manager and

        where was the store manager on July 26, 2021, the recording he objected to was completed,
        rescue or at the time of the police's arrival, since the violation is in the absence of knowledge of these
        could also be established, and during the procedure, no information regarding
        that the camera footage taken on July 26, 2021 was illegally accessed by a third party
        person, so the Authority does not consider it necessary to investigate these circumstances. The Applicant
        furthermore, he also made a motion to clarify circumstances that the Authority considers him to be
        already revealed during the evidentiary procedure, and about which the Applicant was informed
        within the framework of ensuring the right to inspect documents, e.g. which camera made the objectionable recording,

                                                  34 which part of the fence was visible in the recording, was it recorded, when did you attach the
        recording in criminal proceedings, etc.

(160) The Applicant also requested the Authority that the site plan attached by Applicant 1 and the
        based on a photo taken by him earlier from a camera installed on the side of \[the accommodation\].
        determine the previous angle of view of this camera and the extent to which this camera was
        suitable for monitoring his property. According to the Authority's point of view, this is evidential
        motion is, on the one hand, unfulfillable, and, on the other hand, significant from the point of view of the Applicant's request

        does not hold, the legal consequences requested by him are the 1. for camera system CH4
        Even in the absence of knowledge of his "previous" angle of vision, they were revealed during the procedure
        based on other evidence.

(161) The requirement that the factual situation is well-founded in official cases does not mean that it is
        the acting authority must establish all the circumstances of the case step by step. THE
        The authority is only obliged to reveal the facts to the extent necessary for decision-making. THE

        the facts could be established in sufficient depth, the additional proposed by the Applicant
        even without proof, and based on the established facts, the Applicant's requests can be assessed
        they were.

(162) On the basis of the above, the Authority conducts the proof according to the evidentiary motions
        ignores. In this round, the Authority based on the evidence at its disposal, the facts
        sufficiently revealed, and his obligation to clarify the facts is not unlimited.

IV.8. Legal consequences, decision on the application

(163) At the request of the Applicant, the Authority determines that Respondent 1 unlawfully observed

        a part of the Applicant's property and thus unlawfully handled by the Applicant personally
        data, thereby violating Article 6 (1) of the GDPR. Due to the violation, the Authority is the GDPR

        your family's personal information.

(166) The Authority ex officio finds that Respondent 1 is unlawful, Article 6 (1) of the GDPR

        their right to data protection cannot be ensured in any other way. According to the Authority, there is none
        nor can a legitimate interest be shown on the data controller's side that would support and

        would justify the monitoring of the guests through a camera system and their personal data
        treatment in rooms for recreation and relaxation, where their expectations are reasonable

        to the nature of data management, therefore the Authority established that it was revealed during this procedure
        in case of violation, the warning is neither a proportionate nor a dissuasive sanction, therefore

        it is necessary to impose a fine on the basis of Article 58 (2) point (i) of the GDPR.

(175) The violations committed by Respondent 1 are Article 83 (5) of the General Data Protection Regulation
        According to points a) and b) of paragraph 1, the category of fines with a higher amount is more serious

        the amount of the imposed fine is \[…\] % of the net sales of Respondent 1.

(177) During the imposition of fines, the Authority assessed the following circumstances as aggravating circumstances:

            • Violations committed by Respondent 1 - excluding Article 31 of the GDPR

               violation - in terms of their nature, they are considered a more serious violation, since
               Requested 1 principle, related to the legality of data management (legal basis) and affected
               violated provisions on rights \[GDPR Article 83 (1) point a)\];

            • Implemented by Respondent 1 by operating camera system No. 2

               violations persisted for a long time, more than a year - on July 27, 2021
               definitely carried out illegal data processing - and also at the time of the decision
               exist \[83. Article (2) point a)\];

            • According to the statement of Respondent 1, approximately 1,300 in the examined period
               stayed \[at the accommodation\], i.e. the number of people affected can be considered high. The examined
               period, the number of hotel guests could not be precisely determined

               to the fact that data can only be retrieved from NTAK going back one year, while IFA
               on the declaration forms, the number of guest nights, not the
               number of guests will be registered. That is, the number of those affected is only approximate,

               the registered guest nights and the average days spent \[at the accommodation\].
               could be determined as a quotient. \[83. Article (2) point a)\];

            • The voice and likeness of the persons concerned due to the nature of the data processing carried out
               does not constitute a special category of personal data, however, for the jacuzzi and the interior

               in the field of view of the camera, the hotel guests are regularly in bathing suits
               are staying, and the Applicant is also wearing a bathing suit made for him
               on camera. According to the Authority's point of view, it is more harmful to those concerned

               data management through the camera system results in a situation, if not in the recordings
               in general street clothes, but in more incomplete clothes, such as in a bathing suit
               are included. Use of the jacuzzi based on the recordings of the camera located at the jacuzzi

               several guests took off their bathing suits during
               a camera shot of another guest without a top and without swimming trunks, or more
               the camera recorded the party in an intimate position. According to the Authority's point of view, the
               personal data recorded by a camera placed at the jacuzzi

               its illegal handling has greater material weight. \[GDPR Article 83(2)(a)\].

(178) During the imposition of the fine, the Authority assessed the following circumstances as mitigating circumstances:
            • the sign of the area monitored by the camera has been placed at the jacuzzi, so if the recordings

               not to record it, but those concerned could count on camera data management, and it is
               those involved were also involved in the fact that they were photographed without swimwear
               camera recordings \[GDPR Article 83(2)(k)\];

                                                   37 • the established violations can be considered negligent in nature, the Authority on intentionality
               no suggestive circumstance was revealed during the official data protection procedure \[GDPR Article 83 (2)
               paragraph b)\];

            • Respondent 1 has not previously committed a data protection matter under the scope of the GDPR
