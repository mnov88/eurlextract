## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) stating that they had received an invoice with a debt on behalf of Vodafone (a telecommunications company) without having contracted any services. The data subject also reported it to the police and tried to contact Vodafone in order to exercise their right to erasure, but obtained no answer from them.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA concluded during the investigation that Vodafone had processed the personal data of the data subject without any legal basis. Vodafone also recognized such facts, although they remarked that they had later classified the processing of data as fraudulent and cancelled the debt. They additionally alleged that they were trying to improve their security policies to prevent that from happening.

However, the DPA considered that the controller had not acted with due diligence and had failed to implement the necessary measures to avoid processing data without a legal basis, in accordance with the accountability principle. Also, the DPA considered that the controller had no reason to ignore the data subject's erasure request, and that they should have answered to and complied with it.

Therefore, the AEPD fined the controller a total of €120,000 (reduced to €96,000 because of early payment) for:

*   processing personal data without a legal basis, in breach of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"): €70,000 and;
*   not complying with their obligation to erase the data subject's personal data after they had exercised their right to erasure, in breach of [Article 17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"): €50,000.

                                             I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

                                             II

        In the first place, the facts presented may suppose on the part of the
claimed, the commission of an infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD that establishes the
assumptions that allow the processing of personal data to be considered lawful.

        Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it complies with at least one of the following
terms:
      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

      personal for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;
      (…) "

      The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions

considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that one and, in

in particular, the following:

        (…)
        a) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/12

           conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
           Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

        On the one hand, it is proven that the respondent processed the personal data
of the claimant (name, surname and NIF). Thus, the claimed, when hiring no
had the necessary precautions to prove the legitimacy of the contractor.

        The defendant acknowledges the facts in her letter to this Agency dated June 6
May 2021, in which it states: ”the claimant is informed that the steps taken

unacknowledged that your personal data was used, specifically,
their surnames and ID card were classified as fraudulent: In this way, the
associated debt has been correctly canceled, excluding the personal data of
the claimant of any negative financial solvency file in which, in its
If so, you would have signed up for the claimed one ”.

        Hence, the absence of legitimation for the treatment is confirmed, by
how much they show that there was no contract between the two.

        It must be taken into account that the documentation in the file
offers evidence that the complained party violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, all

time that he processed the personal data of the claimant without legitimacy.

        The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
Obligations imposed by the personal data protection regulations
It is thus obvious. A diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment

of third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in conditions
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

      In accordance with the evidence available at this time
procedural, for the first offense, and without prejudice to what results from the instruction of the

procedure, it is considered that the conduct of the claimed party could violate the
Article 6.1 of the RGPD may be constitutive of the offense typified in the article
83.5.a) of the aforementioned Regulation 2016/679.

      In this sense, Recital 40 of the RGPD states:

       "(40) For the treatment to be lawful, personal data must be processed
with the consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established
in accordance with Law, either in this Regulation or by virtue of another Law
of the Union or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation,
including the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the

treatment or the need to perform a contract to which the interested party or
in order to take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the
conclusion of a contract. "

                                               III

        Second, the facts presented may imply the commission of a
infringement of article 17 of the RGPD.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/12

        The right of erasure is contained in article 17 of the RGPD as a right
of the interested party, or concerned with their data, and at the same time implies an obligation of the

responsible (of the treatment), indicating:

        1. The interested party shall have the right to obtain without undue delay from the person in charge
of the treatment the deletion of the personal data that concerns him, which will be
obliged to delete without undue delay the personal data when there is any
of the following circumstances:

        a) the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for
those that were collected or otherwise treated;
        b) the interested party withdraws the consent on which the treatment of
in accordance with Article 6 (1) (a) or Article 9 (2) (a), and

it is not based on another legal basis;
        c) the interested party objects to the processing in accordance with article 21, paragraph 1,
and no other legitimate reasons for the treatment prevail, or the interested party
object to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (2);
        d) the personal data has been unlawfully processed;
        e) personal data must be deleted to comply with a

  legal obligation established in the law of the Union or the Member States
  that applies to the person responsible for the treatment;
        f) the personal data have been obtained in relation to the offer of services
  of the information society mentioned in article 8, paragraph 1.

        3. Sections 1 and 2 will not apply when the treatment is necessary:
        a) to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;
        b) for the fulfillment of a legal obligation that requires the treatment of
  data imposed by the law of the Union or of the Member States that
  apply to the person responsible for the treatment, or for the fulfillment of a mission

  carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the
  responsable;
        c) for reasons of public interest in the field of public health of
  in accordance with Article 9, paragraph 2, letters h) and i), and paragraph 3;
        d) for archival purposes in the public interest, scientific research purposes or
  historical or statistical purposes, in accordance with article 89, paragraph 1, in the

  insofar as the right indicated in paragraph 1 could make it impossible to
  seriously impede the achievement of the objectives of such treatment, or
        e) for the formulation, exercise or defense of claims.

                                             IV

        It has been proven that the claimant exercised the right of deletion before
the claimed entity and its request did not obtain the legally required response.

        The respondent states in her allegations that she is not aware that in her
systems include the record of the presentation of the burofax on September 9,
2020.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/12

       It should be noted that the burofax is a reliable communication with value
probative, the content of the text is accredited, as well as the issuer, the recipient
and the date of shipment.

       In this sense, in the text of the burofax sent to the claimed entity on
September 2020, it is stated by the claimant “I exercise the right to suppress
my personal information".

       The postal service certifies that it was delivered, the burofax, to the address of

claimed on September 9, 2020 at 08:45 hours and was signed by his
representative and consists of the name, surname and ID of the person who took charge of
same.

                                            V

       Article 83.5 b) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the rights of
the interested parties according to articles 12 to 22 "; is punishable, “with fines
administrative fees of € 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, a
an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual business volume of the
previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest amount. "

       Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides: “Each control authority will have
all of the following corrective powers listed below:

       d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of

treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified time frame;

       i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition or in

           application of the provisions of article 72.1.k) of this organic law. "

                                           SAW

       Determination of the sanctions to be imposed in the present case

requires observing the provisions of articles 83.1 and 2 of the RGPD, precepts that,
respectively, provide the following:

    "1. Each supervisory authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
