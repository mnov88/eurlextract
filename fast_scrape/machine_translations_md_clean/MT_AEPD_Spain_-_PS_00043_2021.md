## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) claiming that the home owner association of the residential blocks where he resides had disclosed the personal data of all its members on display boards placed on the ground portal of the three buildings included in the community. The information sheet on the display board contained the data subjects' name and surname, as well as apartment details (building, floor, and apartment number) and their condition as debtors or non-debtors. Because of the fact that the display boards were located on the ground floor portal of the buildings, the data subject argued that his personal data was exposed to third parties who might not be members of the residential community and the home owner association.

The association initially claimed that the disclosure of this information within the community was not subject to data protection laws, and that placing the information on the display board was a decision taken by the owner assembly, and hence with the association members' consent. However, once the AEPD initiated the proceedings, the association changed its stance and acknowledged that placing the information on the display boards was in breach of GDPR, and that the information had been displayed in this way as an exceptional measure to provide relevant information normally disclosed in their regular association meetings, which had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally, the association stated that it had not only taken down the information sheet from the display boards, but that it had also personally apologised to the data subject through a representative, informing him that they had not acted in bad faith or with any intent to damage his reputation.

### Holding

The AEPD held that the home owner association had violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, and issued a fine of €500 euros. When determining the sum of the fine, the AEPD took into consideration as mitigating factors: the fact that the association had not committed any previous GDPR violations; that it had remedied the situation by taking down the information sheet from the display board; that it had given the data subject ample explanations and apologies; and lastly, that the breach occurred due to exceptional circumstances.
