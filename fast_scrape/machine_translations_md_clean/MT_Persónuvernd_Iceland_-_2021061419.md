## English Summary

### Facts

On June 24, 2021, the Icelandic DPA received a complaint from \[A\] (hereinafter the Complainant) about the fact that his email address had been disclosed by the Directorate of Labour in the 'cc' section of an email sent to hundreds of individuals (hereafter, the bulk email). The bulk email in question concerned the resumption of applications for quarantine payments in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The fact that the email addresses of the recipients were visible to other recipients of the bulk email was the result of a human error. The next day, the Directorate of Labor apologized for this error and took measures to prevent such incident from happening again. In particular, the Directorate of Labor reviewed and changed the procedures for mass mailings, so that two employees must now review such emails before they are sent, in order to ensure that personal data are not disclosed by errors. Furthermore, the Directorate of Labor decided to adapt the regular training of its employees so that it would include information on how to prevent such incidents from taking place.

  

### Holding

The Icelandic DPA ruled that the disclosure, by the Directorate of Labor, of the Complainant's e-mail address to other recipients of the bulk email was not compliant with the Icelandic data protection law or the GDPR. However, taking into account the fact that it was the result of a human error, given that the Directorate of Labor took corrective measures to prevent such incident from happening again, the Icelandic DPA decided not to impose any fine.

      The Data Protection Authority received a complaint that the Directorate of Labor had provided an e-mail address
complainant to unauthorized persons by mass mail. It was clear that the sharing of the e-mail address involved
sees a security breach that occurred when email addresses, which should be in duplicate (bcc),
were mistakenly placed in a visible copy (cc). The Directorate of Labor has failed
by informing those affected by the security breach and changing procedures
to try to prevent a recurrence of the same security breach.

    

    
    Ruling On 16 September 2021, the Data Protection Authority issued a ruling in case no. 2021061419: I. Proceedings 1. Outline of the case On 24 June 2021, the Data Protection Authority received a complaint from \[A\] (hereinafter the complainant) about the Directorate of Labour's dissemination of its e-mail address by mass mail. The complaint was accompanied by a copy of the mass e-mail, which was sent on the same day. By letter of 22 July 2021, the Directorate of Labor was invited to provide explanations regarding the complaint. The Directorate of Labour's reply was received by the Data Protection Authority by letter on 17 August of the same year. The reply letter was accompanied by a copy of the mass e-mail, an e-mail from the Directorate of Labor on 25 June 2021 apologizing for the mistakes and procedures for registering safety deficiencies and safety deviations. 2. Complainant's views The complaint states that the Directorate of Labor provided the complainant's e-mail address to one hundred individuals without permission by mass mail on 24 June 2021. Payments from the Directorate of Labor for wages in quarantine 3. The Directorate of Labour's views The Directorate of Labour's reply letter states that on the same day as the mass e - mail was sent, the Directorate of Labour's privacy officer received information that the e - mail address (cc) had been sent to the recipients. Upon closer inspection, it was revealed that by default, standard e-mail had been sent to about 900 e-mail addresses in three separate transmissions and that instead of having recipients in a hidden copy (bcc), they had been placed in a visible copy (cc). The e-mails in question were for the most part the e-mail addresses of companies' contacts. The reply letter states that they were human errors and that they were discovered shortly after the e-mails were sent. The staff of Vinnumálastofnun's IT department had tried to cancel the consignments, which had not yet been received by the recipients, but had not succeeded in all cases. The conclusion of his inspection was that there was no need to report the security breach to the Data Protection Authority, cf. Paragraph 2 Article 27 Act no. 90/2018 on personal protection and processing of personal information. This conclusion was based, among other things, on the fact that the e-mail addresses were mostly e-mail addresses of companies, in addition to which information that individuals had applied for or used resources for quarantine payments would not, in the opinion of the Directorate of Labor, be considered sensitive. personal information according to the definition of Act no. 90/2018. The number of recipients and the fact that this was a unique event that was discovered quickly were also taken into account. Account was also taken of the fact that the Directorate of Labor had sent an e-mail to all recipients of the mass e-mail apologizing for the mistakes that had been made in its transmission and requesting that the recipients delete the e-mail addresses in question. mass mailings in such a way that now two employees must review such shipments before they are sent to ensure that e-mail addresses are not made accessible. The incident will also be taken into account in regular training for employees. Act no. 90/2018 and Article 6. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or complies with the principles of privacy legislation.II.Conditions and conclusion1.
