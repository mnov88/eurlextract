## English Summary

### Facts

An individual (controller) forwarded an e-mail containing the residential address and date of birth of some individuals to 46 unauthorized recipients. Therefore, the DPA opened an investigation.

### Holding

The DPA considered that the controller could not rely on any legal basis for this processing, in breach of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). However, the DPA took into account that the 46 recipients included mainly state authorities and lawyers, who, in accordance with the national law are bound by professional secrecy. The DPA considered this as mitigating circumstances and decided to not impose a fine. It issued a reprimand for the lack of legal basis.

The General Regulation in Article 4(1) defines personal data as any information relating to a specific or identifiable individual; an identifiable individual is one who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as name, identification number, location data, online identifier, or by reference to one or more factors that characterize the physical, physiological, genetic , mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that individual.

According to Article 4(2) of the General Regulation, processing means any act or set of acts carried out in relation to personal data or sets of personal data with or without automated means, such as collection, recording, editing, structuring, storage, adaptation or modifying, retrieving, viewing, using, disclosing by means of, disseminating or otherwise making accessible, adapting or combining, restricting, erasing or destroying.

Point (a) of Article 5(1) of the General Regulation stipulates that personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the individual to whom the personal data relate ('lawfulness, fairness and transparency'). Based on Article 5(2) of the General Regulation, the operator is responsible for compliance with paragraph 1 and is also able to demonstrate this compliance ("responsibility").

Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the General Regulation, the processing of personal data is legal only and to the extent that at least one of the following conditions is met:
(a) the data subject has consented to the processing of his personal data for one or more specified purposes;
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a contracting party, or for the performance of measures at the request of such an individual prior to the conclusion of the contract;
(c) the processing is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation applicable to the controller;
(d) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or other natural person;
(e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of public authority assigned to the controller;
(f) processing is necessary due to the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except when such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual to whom the personal data relate, which require the protection of personal data, in particular when the individual , to whom personal data refer, a child.

Point (f) of the first subparagraph does not apply to processing by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.

Having regard to Article 6(2), which states that Member States may maintain or introduce more detailed provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation regarding the processing of personal data to ensure compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1, so that define in more detail the special requirements related to processing and other measures to ensure legal and fair processing, also for other special cases of processing from Chapter IX, it is also necessary to take into account Article 8 of ZVOP 1. The first paragraph of Article 8 of ZVOP 1 stipulates that personal data can only be processed if the processing of personal data and the personal data being processed is determined by law or if the personal consent of the individual is given for the processing of certain personal data. In the second paragraph of the same article, it is stipulated that the purpose of personal data processing must be determined by law, and in the case of processing based on the individual's personal consent, the individual must be informed in advance of the purpose of personal data processing in writing or in another appropriate way.

III.
(Establishment of the actual situation)

After reading the electronic message dated ..., the criminal authority found that the offender is the signatory of the electronic message dated ..., in which, in addition to the text of the draft amendment to the lawsuit, he also provided personal data (address of residence and date of birth) within the framework of the identification data of the defendants ... and ..., and forwarded it to the e-mail addresses of 46 recipients. Even otherwise, the violator in the relevant misdemeanor procedure communicated with the misdemeanor authority precisely via the email address... After reviewing the written statement that the violator gave in the misdemeanor proceeding, the misdemeanor authority concluded that the violator, due to the fact that he was the sender of the electronic message dated ..., also he did not dispute.

Furthermore, the misdemeanor authority notes that all addressees of the electronic message dated ... (among them in particular ...) were not entitled to be informed of the residential address and date of birth of the individuals ... and ..., since the offender is not eligible for such processing (disclosure through mediation) of personal data had grounds in law or in the personal consent of the individuals concerned. Taking into account Article 5(2) of the General Regulation, the above is additionally confirmed by the fact that the violator did not state in the written statement that the processing of personal data (disclosure through mediation) had a basis in law or that the processing would be based on any of the possible legal bases , specified in Article 6(1) of the General Regulation, did not even submit the possible consent of the individuals concerned. In a written statement, the infringer stated that he obtained the personal data of the concerned individuals legally and is processing them for the purposes arising from the draft supplement to the lawsuit. The criminal authority points out that the processing of the residence address and date of birth of individuals ... and ... for the purpose of asserting legal claims, which can be understood from the draft supplement to the lawsuit, must be distinguished from the processing of these same personal data in the context of the electronic message for ..., which represents disclosure of personal data (address of residence and date of birth) of individuals ... and ... by intervening outside the court (or other) procedure, within the framework of which the violator would enforce any claims. The fact that the violator had no basis for disclosing the address and date of birth of ... and ... to the 46 recipients of the e-mail dated ... where he lives and/or when does he celebrate his birthday." In relation to this belief, the misdemeanor authority points out that even from the stated claim of the violator it is possible to discern an essential guideline of the law on the protection of personal data, which leaves the decision to disclose personal data primarily in the domain of the specific individuals to whom the personal data relate .

Despite the fact that the act of disclosing personal data by forwarding it to the e-mail addresses of 46 addressees who are not entitled to know the address and date of birth of the individuals ... and ... represents an intrusion into the information privacy of the individuals whose data was disclosed in this way, it is a misdemeanor at the same time, the authority found that in the case under consideration there are mitigating circumstances which, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 21 ZP 1, justify the issuance of a warning. As a mitigating circumstance, the misdemeanor authority took into account the broader circumstances in which the offense was committed, which can be seen from the draft supplement to the lawsuit and the decisions of the Supreme Court of Appeal and the ECtHR, which the offender highlighted in his written statement and which, among other things, indicate the offender's tendencies, from which committed the offence. From the above documents, it can be seen that the violator has been asserting various legal claims against the Republic of Slovenia and specific civil servants (also against ... and ...) for several years, which primarily stem from the demolition of the building of the violator and his family members in 2010 based on the decision on enforcement , which was declared null and void. Also, as a mitigating circumstance, the misdemeanor authority took into account that among the 46 addressees, in addition to journalists and media editors, there are mainly state authorities and lawyers, which are in accordance with the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 6 of the Law on Advocacy (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 18/93, 24/96 US Ord., 24/01, 54/08, 35/09, 97/14, 8/16 US Ord., 46/16, 36/19 and 130/22) bound to protect professional secrecy.

IV.

- an electronic message with the subject ... received by the misdemeanor authority on ... from the email address ... (0603-98/2022/1);
- statement of the infringer (with attachments) dated 11/10/2022 (0603-98/2022/5);
- the verdict of the Supreme Court of Appeal ... dated ..., which is accessible via the online link ...;

- the verdict of the Supreme Court of Appeal ... dated ..., which is accessible via the online link ...;
- ECtHR decision on appeal no. ... dated ..., which is accessible via the web link ...

Article 1 of ZVOP, for which the individual is fined from 200 to 830 euros.

When assessing the sanction, the criminal authority took into account the provisions of the first and second paragraphs of Article 27 of the ZP-1 and when applying the second paragraph of Article 26 of the ZP 1, which stipulates that when assessing the sanction, all circumstances that affect whether the sanction should be taken into account minor or major (mitigating and aggravating circumstances), in particular: the degree of the offender's responsibility for the offence, the inclinations from which he committed the offence, the degree of endangerment or violation of the protected property, the circumstances in which the offense was committed, the previous life of the offender, his personal circumstances , his behavior after the offense was committed, in particular, whether he settled the damage, and the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 21 of the Criminal Code 1, which stipulates that the offense authority may issue a warning for an offense committed under such mitigating circumstances, which make it particularly light, to the offender for both misdemeanors, taking into account the second and third paragraphs of Article 4 ZP-1, a warning was issued instead of a fine.

V.
