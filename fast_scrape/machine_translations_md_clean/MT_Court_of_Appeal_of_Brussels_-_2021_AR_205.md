## English Summary

### Facts

After a contractual relationship with the music company who owned the Facebook fanpage of the musician (including their full name), the latter wanted to get back control of this page. The DPA issued an order to transfer the page (APD/GBA - 14/2020) on the basis of data portability, but this order was annulled by the Court of Appeal. The litigation chamber of the DPA then issued a second decision ([APD/GBA - 02/2021](/index.php?title=APD/GBA_-_02/2021 "APD/GBA - 02/2021")) which imposed a fine of €10,000 on the music company for not transferring the fanpage of the musician to them, after they had exercised their right to data portability and right to object. The DPA imposed this second decision based on the lack of consent from the artist to use its name and the termination of the management agreement. The defendant has now appealed this decision.

According to the defendant, the DPA was incorrect to find that the lawfulness of the processing of the complainant's personal data under Article 6(1)(b) stopped on 3 November 2019, when the management agreement between the artist and the defendant was terminated. The defendant argues that the termination of the management agreement has no effects on its rights to manage the Facebook page. Its right to maintain the Facebook page was not based on the management agreement. Instead, the intellectual property rights to the musical works of the artist are relevant. As the exclusive licensee of certain musical works of the artist, the defendant is entitled to use the name and image of the performing artist of these musical works for the purpose of marketing and commercialisation of the music. These rights derive from various agreements between the company and claimant (not including the management agreement) which also involve a third party music producer.

### Holding

The Court of Appeal annulled the DPA's decision.

It held that, despite the termination of the management agreement, the music company still had a legitimate interest to manage the fanpage. This is because, according to an artist agreement of 26 July 2008, a license agreement of 20 November 2015, and in line with the rights of the music producer pursuant to Article XI.209 of the Belgian Code of Economic Law ('Wetboek van Economisch recht', 'WEB'), the music company is exclusively entitled to use the name and image of the music artist of the musical works which are the subject matter of those agreements, for the duration of the copyright rights (70 years from the first recording). The complainant is paid royalties in return. In this context, the Facebook page was set up and used, among other things, to promote the artist's name and promote the sale of the relevant music works. The Court stated that the personal data on the fanpage are in any case very limited, and that the legitimate interest of the defendant in processing this data, which helps the complainant grow in outreach, is more important. No violation of Article 21(1) read in conjunction with Article 12(3) could therefore be found by the DPA.

        treatment on the merits

4.      On 10 March 2020, the complaint was lodged pursuant to Article 58 of the Act of 3 December 2017

pursuant to Article 62, §1 WOG, this complaint was transferred by the first-line service to the
Dispute Resolution Chamber (document 2).

5.      Subsequently, on 14 April 2020, the Dispute Resolution Chamber, pursuant to Article 95, §1 WOG-, adopted a decision on the complaint.

by way of 'provisional and corrective measure'- a so-called provisional 'light decision', i.e. decision
namely decision no. 14/2020 (document 3). In this decision, the following was considered, among other things:

        "\[...\] The complainant objects to the administration of the fan page on Facebook with her name
        and first name by the joint processing agents, and seeks, inter alia, the
        rights for the management of the fan page.         Given that the complainant's objection to the processing of personal data, particularly
        her surname and first name, is clearly formulated in the complaint, the Dispute Resolution Chamber considers it
        sufficient to first of all address the joint controllers in order to

        warn them to stop any infringements of theAVG and to comply with the complainant's request.
        request of the complainant.

        In this sense, for the sake of completeness, the Dispute Resolution Chamber notes that the complainant is invoking
        its right to data portability, pursuant to article 20AVG, and its right

        to object pursuant to Article 21 of the AVG. She does not wish that the fan page, and with it the personal
        fanpage the personal data relating to her are simply removed.

6.      The operative part of this 'light decision' read (section 3):

        "decides the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the Data Protection Authority to:

In the context of this submission, which set out fifteen pleas in law,2 she stated inter alia
(Exhibit 20):

       and that, in the process, those personal data are systematically subject to changes or

       adjustments by these persons;

       That there are also profiles on other online platforms, such as Youtube and Linkedln, where the personal data are stored.

       profiles were created that bear the name and first name and other personal details of Mrs. X, and that
       these profiles are managed by Y2 and/or Mr. Y1, and this without the consent of Mrs. X

costs of Mrs. X.

11.      On 5 August 2020, Y2 and Mr. Y1 filed their reply briefs with the

Disputes Chamber (document 21).

In this conclusion, Y2 and Mr. Y1 maintained their earlier requests as formulated in

their conclusion of 24 June 2020, with the addition of the request to transfer the claim of Mrs. X regarding
the transfer of the management rights on other social media profiles, including Youtube and
Linkedln, to be rejected as 'inadmissible, at least unfounded'.

In addition, Y2 and Mr. Y1 added four new pleas in law to their defence, in addition to the ones already put forward

7.1. the admissibility of the plea in law concerning enforceability -

The GBA submits that the applicants' plea is inadmissible.

To the extent that enforceability was not suspended for the entirety of the decision, the
plea is inadmissible.

However, because the Market Court is now deciding the dispute in its entirety, the plea is without
object.

A proper investigation of the complaint by the front line service should have shown that there is no

There was no reason to prosecute Y1.

To the extent that it is claimed that the GBA lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the complaint and that the

of his subjective rights by the CBA - who is claiming compensation (see the 10 plea in law put forward by the
the applicants) - is indeed admissible.

the complainant. It points out that this artist agreement and this
licence agreement are still applicable. She also refers to Article Xl.209 WER.

The question of whether the GBA Dispute Resolution Chamber - rightly or wrongly imposed a sanction sensu photo
imposed, is the question of the merits of the claim.

The Dispute Resolution Chamber is "competent" to render a decision as soon as article 92 - 1° WOG is complied with (i.e. as soon as it has been requested to do so).
1° WOG (i.e. as soon as it is requested by the first-line service, in accordance with Article 62, § 1,

The Dispute Resolution Chamber was therefore competent to make a decision.
Whether or not Y2 should be regarded as a data controller also belongs to the merits of the case and not to the
the merits of the case and not the question of jurisdiction.

The third plea by Y2 and Y1 - to the extent that it relates to the
competence issue - is not well-founded.

7.4. admissibility of the complaint 9

The applicants maintain that the Dispute Resolution Chamber was not validly seized.

Document 2 in the GBA file shows that the complaint was declared admissible pursuant to Article 58 of the WOG on 10 March
2020 and that it had been declared admissible by the Dispute Resolution Chamber in accordance with Article 62 §1 WOG.

First-line service forwarded it to the Dispute Chamber.

8 Third plea by the applicants, fourth plea by the CPC
9 Fourth plea by the applicants, fifth plea by the CBA Court of Appeal Brussels -2021/AR/205 - p. 24

The complaint is admissible. The fourth plea in law put forward by the applicants fails on the basis of the facts.

7.5. lawful processing of personal data-art 6 AVG-processing excontractu 10

1. Y2 asserts that it has processed the data lawfully.

It states:

        "The GBA's contention that the lawfulness of the processing of the personal data
        was initially based on Article 6(1)(b) of the AVG is correct.

        However, the GBA again completely misses the point when it claims that this stopped on 3

        November 2019 where the management of a page via social media platforms in the
        entertainment sector would result from the management agreement.

        Thus, the GBA erroneously believes that by terminating this

        management agreement (as of 03/11/2019), the established ground for processing (in the
        within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(b) of the AVG} also de facto ended and appellant Y2 would subsequently no longer have any
        rights to manage the page and the "personal data" of X.

        This shows that the GBA did not understand:

        5.1.1. It is repeated that Y2 did not base the stated rights on its mandate that followed from the -actually terminated- management agreement.
        It is repeated that Y2 did not base the stated rights on its mandate that followed from the -actually terminated- management agreement. The termination of the

        The termination of the management agreement thus has no influence whatsoever on the rights that Y2 has/had
        to manage the facebook page.

        The observation of the GBA that it could be "sufficiently assumed" that the concluded
        management agreement provided a legal basis for Y2 to manage a page on social media in the name and/or for the benefit of the artist.
        artist to manage a page on social media, illustrates the GBA's reluctance or refusal to
        GBA or lack of understanding to examine the objective facts and the applicable regulations (which

        has already been tried to make clear on numerous occasions), so that nothing had to be
        'adopted'...

        5.1.2. The intellectual property rights to the following musical works are relevant here:

               1. 2014: \[title number 1\]: master rights with Y2 (the producer)
               2. 2015: \[title number 2\]: Master rights with Y2 (the producer)

  Fifth plea in law by the applicants, sixth plea in law by the GBAH Court of Appeal Brussels -2021/AR/205 -p. 25

        As a producer of phonograms or master owner or subsequent exclusive licensee of certain
        exclusive licensee of certain musical works (not manager!), Y2 is entitled to sell

        use of the name and image of the performing artist of these musical works for the purpose of marketing and
        commercialisation and exploitation of music.

        In this context, reference is made to agreements between the parties, but also with interested parties
        (such as producers):

        - The artist agreement 2008 and various appendices; (piece 2)
        - The master agreements with the producers2014; (piece 35-36)

        - The 2015 publishing agreement; (document 5)
        - Deadlines and Annexes for each musical work (File 37-39).

        In this context, reference is made to certain investments made by Y2.

        The consequence of these choices is that the costs associated with the first two musical works

        and were also borne by Y2 (exhibit 34), then from the end of 2015 by the

        So the existence of these rights cannot be denied! Yet this is what happened.

        This follows from the contracts concluded and this follows from the relevant legislation: see also article
       X l.209 WER on the rights of the producer.

       Without them, it is not possible for her to exploit the work.

       Article 3.5 Artist contract: Record company U "have the right to use the Artist's name, image and

       The same applies to the exclusive licence agreement of 2015, which is still in force today, according to which these rights are granted to Y2 for 15 years.

       from the release of the music.

       This is explicitly stated in the 2015 licence agreement.

       This 2015 Licensing Agreement gives Y2 the exclusive right to exploit the works of
       record company XY for 15 years from release; the agreement runs from 3 November
       2015 to 3 November 2020, but was not terminated and therefore extended for one year or until 3 November 2021 already.
       until 3 November 2021 in advance.

       The agreement provides in article 4 that X grants Y2 without restriction the right to
       exclusive use of name and image for the duration of the exploitation (or 15 years after the
       release).

       5.1.2.3. In exchange for the rights granted, the artist receives a payment, usually a percentage of the proceeds (a royalty).
       In return for the rights granted, the artist receives remuneration, usually a percentage of the revenue (a so-called royalty).

       This has never been under discussion and follows from the documents: see statements, see the

       invoices of the artist (and her company Z): see documents 40-42. The invoices are
       proof of acceptance and reality of the foregoing.

       Social media is necessary in order to distribute and obtain income from music.
       music. Through uploads, music is fingerprinted e.g. by YouTube worldwide and in all

       possible forms. Each use of a musical work online is linked to the relevant account of the rights holder

       Thus, each use of that work can be billed and the rights accrue to the rights holder(s).
       to the rights holder(s). 8

       It is important that these revenues are settled via the royalty statements per track and can
       can also be checked and detailed at any time via the search function in the Excel
       appendix of the statements. (Pieces 41-42) All revenues per track are settled: See
       example X LS statement in attachment: X\_1600871245.xlsx ..Go to tab at the bottom

       To make it even clearer by way of example: piece 42: YouTube statement

       Court of Appeal Brussels-2021/AR/205-p. 27

        In short, the account (for digital sale or use) is linked to the relevant

        professional pages of the rights holder(s).

        Consequently, Y2, as a right-holder (producer - exclusive licensee), rightly has
       accounts on Facebook but also, for example, on YouTube, and the musical works to which they hold the rights are

       rights to which she is entitled and which she exploits on the music platforms are linked to her account (i.e. not to an account of the respondent).
       not an account of the respondent) on these platforms. After all, in this way it is obtained that correct
       can be paid for the (digital) purchase or use.

        5.1.3. Decision in the present case:

       Thus, Y2 owns rights which enable it to use the musical works of the performer X

       can reproduce, promote, sell (digitally), hire out, use, ...and will use the name and image of the artist for that purpose.
       using the name and the image of the artist.

       This in no way stopped on 3 November 2019, only the management relationship (which is separate from this).
       separate).

       It is in this professional context that Y2 created a professional page,
       managed and through the page of this performing artist under the name \[...\] music was
       music was distributed and sold digitally.

       That this is linked to the music rather than to the person is also apparent from the designation
       \[...\], where the person concerned had named her own label \[...\] and had obtained the exclusive rights for these tracks (of which X is the producer).
       (of which X is producer) the exclusive licence for the exclusive commercialisation of her
       music to Y2 in 2015.

       Thus, it must be concluded that pursuant to the contractual relationship between Y2 and X and in order to
       exploitation and promotion of musical works to which Y2 has acquired rights, use of
       the name and image of the artist (X) on professional social media is a necessary

       consequence.

       5.1.4. Completely unjustified, the GBA claims that the foregoing is not proven with
       force of evidence'. Reference can be made to the foregoing and the extensive

       collection of documents.

       5.1.5. As regards the judgement of the Leuven Court of Appeal, which is included in the GBA's file, it should be made clear that this judgement was the subject of an appeal.
       of the file, it should be made clear that an appeal has been lodged against this judgment and that this appeal is pending.
       and this appeal is pending. The case is being heard before the Court of Appeal in

       Brussels in November 2021.

       Reference is made to the appeal decisions of the concluvant in this case and to the statement of
       (see document 44) Court of Appeal Brussels -2021/AR/205 - p. 28

        From the judgment read together with the documents in this case, it appears that the Strike Court indeed

        had not understood the foregoing either (possible reason why the GBA was misled?) and
       the parties are confident that this will be rectified on appeal.

       Moreover, this is a question of market practices and not the processing of personal data, which means that the case had to be approached differently anyway and from the point of view of the
       personal data, which meant that the case had to be approached differently and from a different angle.

       different angle...

        Ground for processing - legitimate interest - not required but present

       5.2.1. At first instance, the GBA again incorrectly states in its decision
       that the appellant Y2's right to use X's surname and first name for the purpose of exploiting certain
       of certain works would result from certain copyrights (??) (see supra - it concerns

       not initially about the copyrights or rights of Y2 as publisher/publisher of works written by X).
       of works written by X)

       Thus, the use of the name and surname of the complainant would be "acceptable under the law"...
       legislation"... (?) Again, this statement shows a lack of understanding and knowledge or

       understanding of the rights and agreements, their effects and the functioning of the whole
       entire music sector.

       There is no question of "copyright" or any capacity of author in this case, only the

       rights of the producer or exclusive licensee. Reference is made to
       above.

       5.2.2. Next, in its decision, the GBA claims that although appellant Y2 does have
       has a legitimate interest in maintaining the page (and the personal data in it), the GBA

       processing), the management of the Facebook page "goes beyond" the use of the name and first name ofX.
       and first name ofX. (?)

       The GBA is wrong in this case to consider that Y2 - by managing the page - is in the

       person of X in order to present itself to the outside world in her name ...(??)
       Thus, the GBA even enters into the realm of market practices and has clearly
       guided by the - manifestly erroneous - judgment of the Leuven Strike Court.

       The commercial interest and right of exploitation of Y2 would thus not outweigh the

       X's rights to personal identity protected by Article 8 of the
       Charter.

       The GBA's decisions confirm this and state that after the expiry of the

       contractual relationship on 3 November 2019, Y2 was also unable to rely on a justification of
       justification of Article 6.1(1)(f) AVG for the management of the
       Facebook page.

       The GBA completely misses the point here.Court of Appeal Brussels -2021/AR/205 - p. 29

        5.2.3. Reference is made to the above. The exploitation via various online platforms and

        social media (under the name of the performer, of course!) is an indispensable consequence of the exploitation rights and even an obligation to exploit.
        necessary consequence of the exploitation rights and even an exploitation obligation.

        This is confirmed, by the way, where the GBA states that Y2 both has the right to use the

        the musical works and Y2 has the right to use the first and last name of X for this purpose.
        for this purpose. If you can understand, you can...

        It is therefore astonishing that - in spite of the recognition of the legitimacy of the
        It is therefore surprising that - in spite of the acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the collaboration - at the same time it is argued that Y2 should

        to the outside world as X ... ? This is, by the way, hushed up in the GBA's
        decisions of the GBA ...

        In any case, there is no evidence of this and it is not substantiated by the GBA either. It concerns a

        own interpretation and such action and the question of its lawfulness is
        even at issue, nor is it for the GBA to judge this. It concerns a
        market practice to be judged by the strike court on appeal. (section 44}

        In any case, the GBA cannot be followed in this, given the fact that on the purely professional market, the GBA is not involved in the strike.

        Facebook page not a single personal or private information of the person concerned is used (besides the
        (apart from the name and image, which the GBA does not disapprove of) so that there is no question of 'the management of the personal data of the person concerned'.
        the management of the personal data of the identity of the person concerned'as is protected by Article 8 of the
        protected by Article 8 of the Charter.

        This argumentation of the GBA can thus neither be understood nor taken seriously.
        be taken seriously.

        The exploitation and commercialisation of musical works {which today is mainly

        online) is thus absolutely necessary for the interest of the rightholder as it is mainly in this way that
        it is primarily in this way that income is generated for the musical works. (supra)

        In view of the fact that in the first place there is no processing of

        personal data, but only (legally!) the commercialisation of musical works in a professional
        professional context, the personal data are at all events very limited (if there were any
        would be the processing of personal data), and the exploitation is a legitimate interest of Y2, the
        is of Y2, the interest of Y2 weighs much more heavily, especially since the GBA is in no way

        demonstrate in any way how the management of a Facebook page by Y2 would be harmful.

        On the contrary, it can be argued that the exploitation just contributes to the growth and reputation of the
        person concerned and that she thereby acquires royalties on the music sold! In any case, there is no question of
        in any case. (See also her invoices for this in relation to Y2 exhibits 40-42}

        Although Y2 has an adequate basis on the agreements and regulations (supra) for the
        for the 'processing' or management of the page and the processing ground of
       justifiable interest is in principle not necessary, one can establish that also on

       on the basis of the legitimate interest, Y2 manages the Facebook page in accordance with the law.
        The contested decision should be reformed. "Court of Appeal Brussels -2021/AR/205 -p. 30

2. The GBA replicates as follows:

       It was reasonable to assume that the management agreement concluded

       (on the basis of Article 6.1, first paragraph, b) of the AVG) provided a legal basis for Y2 to - in the name and/or for the benefit of the artist
       behalf of and/or for the benefit of the artist whose management was taken care of - to manage a fan page with the

       stated therein: "In any event, it cannot but be objectively established\[...\] that at present

       there is no longer a contractual relationship between the parties."

        57. As a result, after 3 November 2019 Y2 could no longer rely on the condition of

       justification.

       58.      On pp. 20-22 of their Summary Conclusion, the applicants argue that because of an
       exclusive licence agreement and/or an artist's agreement also after 3 November 2019
       they still had a contractual basis to manage the fan page 'X' and to use the fan page 'X' for their own purposes.

       to process Ms X's personal data in doing so. The applicants invoke -
       inter alia with reference to Article 3.5 of an artist's contract (document 2 of the
       The applicants rely - among other things with reference to Article 3.5 of an artist's contract (document 2 of the applicants) - on the fact that they have "the name, the image and the biographical material of the Artist and all relevant and necessary
       of the Artist and all relevant and necessary information about the Artist" (i.e. Mrs. X)
       were allowed to use the Artist's name, image and biographical material for the "reasonable exploitation of the artistic creations and recordings".

       in respect of which Y2 may assert intellectual property rights.

       This argument is not convincing either.

       Firstly, the applicants fail to demonstrate with evidentiary documents that the cited exclusive licence
       cited exclusive licence agreement and/or performer's agreement actually
       actually provide for the concrete right, for a longer period or for an indefinite period, to perform in
       in the name of Ms X and with the image of Ms X on the internet a fan page

       (such as a Facebook fan page). Hereby it should be recalled
       Court of Appeal Brussels -2021/AR/205 -p. 31

                That the page in question is not merely a promotional page which specifically promotes
        praises the musical works over which Y2 could/can assert intellectual rights. The

        page in question does not bear the name of these musical works or of the music project
        artistic project A\]' in which Ms X acted as a singer. The music project '\[artistic
        project A\]' has its own fan page (piece 11 by the applicants), separate from the fan page
        ''.
                Nor does the page in question bear the name of 'Y2' (or his

        commercial name 'Platenfirma U') and the personal data of Ms X are merely used to make
        X's personal data are only used to promote and/or exploit specific musical works on such a page.
        exploit on such page.

        However, neither the agreements cited by the applicants nor the cited
        Article Xl.209 WER grants such a far-reaching right to Y2 or its
        to present themselves 'in globo' as 'X'. At the very least, the applicants fail to point out
        At the very least, the applicants fail to point to any relevant passage in the agreements or Article Xl.209 WER.
        Article Xl.209 WER. Moreover, the applicants acknowledge in their

        Summary Conclusion (p. 3) the applicants even explicitly acknowledge that Y2 only has the licensing rights to "a limited number of musical works of
        "a limited number of musical works of X". Y2 therefore does not have any exclusive rights with regard to X's entire artistic output.
        X's entire artistic output, let alone that it has a contractual right to sell itself on the market.
        contractual right to present itself on the internet, via a Facebook page, as 'X'.
        on the Internet, via a Facebook page, as 'X'.

        Nevertheless, Article 5.2 of the AVG stipulates that the controller must verify the
        "lawfulness" (Art. 5.1.a) AVG) of its processing of personal data must always be able to actively
        must always be able to "prove" (in the context of its "accountability"). In the same vein
        Article 24.1 of the AVG provides that the controller must at all times be able to

        "be able to demonstrate at any time that the processing is carried out in compliance with the \[AVG}
        (Art. 24.1 AVG).   This is explicitly the data controller's own "responsibility
        of the controller" (Art. 24 AVG). The accountability applies
        with regard to each of the processing grounds of Art. 6.1AVG."

relevant and cannot be an argument before the Market Court, which rules autonomously in accordance with Article 47 HGEU.

7. The own dissections that the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the GBA believes it can make on the basis of
writings that were allegedly exchanged between the complainant and/or Facebook and Y2 or Y1 are not
relevant. The Dispute Resolution Chamber does not have jurisdiction to assess the subjective rights of the parties and to reserve consequences for them.

It is for the Court to verify the legality of the inference that the

contested decision draws from the facts as they have been presented.

9. To the extent that the contested decision states

        73. As already indicated, there were various contractual links between the
        Second Defendant and the Complainant, including a management agreement (as of 2008)
        an artist agreement (as of 26 July 2008) and an exclusive publishing agreement
        (from3 November 2015). This is also evidenced by documents provided by the Second Defendant.

        74. The contractual ties came to an end on 3 November 2019. This is confirmed
        ("there are no contractual ties") by counsel for the second defendant in her
        communication with counsel for the Complainant in February 2020. This communication was
        attached as a document to the plaintiff's reply argument.Court of Appeal Brussels -2021/AR/205- p. 37

The pleas in law 6 to 9 put forward by the applicants need not be examined since they cannot lead to any other sanction than the

1. The redress/appeal before the Market Court is an action derogating from ordinary law (in a single instance and
instance and aimed at the annulment of an administrative decision and therefore not at the reformation of a judicial decision.
reform a judicial decision, at most the Court can 'substitute' its own decision

replace' the annulled decision).

An appeal to the Market Court is not identifiable with an "ordinary" appeal.

The (only) "appeal" that can be lodged before the Market Court in the context of Article 108 § 1 WOG is an appeal/appeal against the (administrative) decision itself.
Markets Court is an appeal/appeal against the (administrative) decision itself.

Of course, Y2 and Y1 are always free to approach the 'ordinary' civil court with a claim for
for damages.

2. Y2 and Y1 claim that the GBA be ordered to pay damages.

The Market Court therefore has no jurisdiction to rule on this specific claim.

    8. Court costs.

The GBA is the unsuccessful party; it is obliged to pay the legal costs on behalf of Y2 and Y1, to be estimated at the basic legal costs for non-monetary compensation.
