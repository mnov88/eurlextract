## English Summary

### Facts

In January 2022, the data subject was on a public road with his dog feeling unwell due to the ingestion of alcoholic beverages. When the data subject stopped, an unknown person approached in his car holding his mobile phone from the driver's seat.

Without the data subject’s consent, the driver recorded the data subject on the aforementioned public road for a period of 1 minute and 35 seconds. In the video it is evident that the face of the data subject can be seen, being perfectly recognisable.

Allegedly, the data subject was in very bad physical condition due to the ingestion of alcoholic beverages, holding on to the litter bin. The video has been disseminated and disclosed by the author, and more unknown persons, at first by Whatsapp, both to individual users and Whatsapp groups, but later was published and disseminated by other social networks: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.

In September 2022, it was confirmed that Facebook had removed the video in question.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA fined an individual €10,000 for publishing a video of a data subject in a vulnerable situation, without his consent, violating [Article 6 (1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").
