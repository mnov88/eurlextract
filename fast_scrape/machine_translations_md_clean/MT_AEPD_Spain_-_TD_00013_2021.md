## English Summary

### Facts

A complainant asked a controller to erase all the personal data related to them. This included study and educational data and the subscription to a newsletter.

The controller accepted to erase the data related to the newsletter, therefore stopping such processing, but refused to delete the study and educational data without proof of the data subject identity, asking for their national ID card in order to verify it, with grounds in Article 12(6) GDPR.

### Holding

The AEPD held that, given that the controller had not asked for their national ID card when obtaining the complainant's data, it was not necessary to ask for it for the exercise of their rights. The authority argued that there were no doubts regarding the identity of the data subject, as they had signed up for the services of the controller, and therefore provided their data, using the same email account used to lodge the erasure request.

Hence, the AEPD ordered the controller to comply with the erasure request without further requirements to the data subject.
