## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject exercised its right to erasure against COFIDIS S.A., SUCURSAL EN ESPAÑA, a bank focusing on consumer credits (the controller). The controller did not reply to this request. Subsequently, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA and provided documents which proved that the right had been exercised.

The DPA then granted the controller a hearing, so that they could present their point of view. As their response, the controller sent the DPA an answer to the request by the data subject. However, the controller still did not send a response directly to the data subject.

### Holding

First, the Spanish DPA pointed out that a controller needs to answer requests by a data subject within one month according to [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR"). The authority also noted that a controller must not in any case ignore requests by a data subject. The controller bears the burden of proof of compliance with these provisions.

Second, the DPA held that it is not acceptable that the reponse to a request is only made on the occasion of an administrative procedure, like the formulation of allegations in this case.

Hence, the DPA upheld the complaint. The authority additionally urged the controller to inform the data subject whether the right to erasure is granted or not within ten working days.

the performance of their functions. In the event that they have designated a
data protection delegate, article 39 of the GDPR attributes to him the function of

In the same way, the internal legal system, in article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD, has
provided a mechanism prior to the admission for processing of the claims that are

formulated before the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, which consists of giving
transfer of the same to the data protection delegates designated by the
responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the purposes provided in article 37 of
the aforementioned norm, or to them when they have not designated them, so that they proceed to the
analysis of said claims and to respond to them within a month.

In accordance with this regulation, prior to the admission for processing of the
claim that gives rise to this procedure, it was transferred to the
responsible entity to proceed with its analysis, respond to this Agency
within a month and certify having provided the claimant with the due response,
in the event of exercise of the rights regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the

GDPR.

provided for in article 64.2 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for

Data Protection agreed to admit the claim submitted for processing. Saying
agreement for admission to processing determines the opening of this procedure of

of the GDPR), and is obliged to respond to requests made no later than a

legally required response.

to this Agency, but does not certify having met the request of the claimant

sending you the required response to your request.

In this regard, it should be noted that it cannot be accepted that the corresponding answer

The aforementioned rules do not allow the request to be ignored as if it were not

files of the entity or even in those cases in which it did not meet the

obliged to require the correction of the deficiencies observed or, where appropriate,

deny the request with reasons indicating the reasons why it is not appropriate
consider the law in question.

Therefore, the request made obliges the controller to give an express response, in
in any case, using any means that justifies the receipt of the
reply.

Given that a copy of the necessary communication that must be addressed to the
claimant informing him about the decision he has adopted regarding the
request to exercise rights, it is appropriate to estimate the claim that originated the
present procedure.
