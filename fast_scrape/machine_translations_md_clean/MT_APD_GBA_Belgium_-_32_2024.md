## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject’s credit application was refused by the controller. Consequently, the data subject exercised his right of access with the controller and filed a complaint with its Financial Services Ombudsman. The controller informed him that 3 files had been consulted in examining his credit application: (i) his own file, (ii) the Central Individual Credit Register file and (iii) a finance company’s file. The controller shared the full content of the data subject’s file and only the identity and contact details of the respective controllers. It also told the data subject to contact the controllers of those files to exercise his right of access regarding said documents.

The data subject claimed that the information to which he had been given access to was incomplete, as the controller also had the “purpose of the credit” as well as a copy of his identity card. The data subject asked the controller to confirm that he had been given access to all his personal data. The controller responded that it had other data in its possession, namely the one it received as part of the data subject’s complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.

Following this, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”).

### Holding

Under [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR"), the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller a confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him are being processed and if so, to obtain access to such personal data. The APD considered that in the present case, the controller did not respond directly to the data subject’s question asking it to confirm that he had been given access to all his personal data. Thus, the data subject did not obtain a conclusive answer or access as required by [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR").

Moreover, [Article 15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3 "Article 15 GDPR") provides that the controller must provide a copy of the personal data being processed. The APD held that the controller processed an image of the data subject’s identity card and failed to provide a copy in response to the request. Therefore, the controller violated [Article 15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3 "Article 15 GDPR").

Finally, the APD pointed out that the purpose of the right of access is to “to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing” (Recital 63 GDPR). The right of access therefore supports the right to rectification. Regarding the 2 other files the controller consulted, the APD considered that the controller determined the means and purposes of the processing of the personal data in question. Without access to these 2 files, the data subject could not determine whether it was necessary to contact the controllers of those files in order to exercise his right to rectification.

The APD therefore ordered the controller to comply with the data subject’s access request by granting him access to all the personal data concerning him, as well as a copy of the data in question.

## Comment

As this was a prima facie decision, if the controller does not agree with the contents of the decision or believes that it has factual and/or legal arguments that could lead to a different decision, it may submit a request for a hearing to the APD within 30 days of the notification of the decision.

                                                Decision 32/2024 of February 13, 2024

File number: DOS-2024-00078

Subject: Complaint due to insufficient response to a request for access

The Disputes Chamber of the Data Protection Authority, composed of Mr

Hielke HIJMANS, sole chairman;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016

on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of

personal data and regarding the free movement of such data and to the revocation of

Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter “GDPR”;

Having regard to the law of 3 December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority,

hereinafter “WOG”;

In view of the internal rules of order, as approved by the House of Representatives

Representatives on December 20, 2018 and published in the Belgian Official Gazette on

January 15, 2019;

Considering the documents in the file;

Has made the following decision regarding:

Complainant: X, hereinafter “the complainant”

The defendant: Y, hereinafter “the defendant” Decision 32/2024 — 2/7

I. Facts and procedure

 1. On December 26, 2023, the complainant will submit a complaint to the Data Protection Authority

       against the defendant.

 2. The subject of the complaint concerns the exercise of the right of access by the complainant

       without receiving an adequate response from the controller.

       The complainant had exercised his right of access after his credit application was refused

       by the defendant. As a result, the defendant informed the complainant that there were three

       files were consulted in examining his credit application, namely that

       from the defendant itself, the Central Office for Credit to Private Individuals, and a
       financing company. The defendant sent “a complete content of the data

       that are in our files” to the complainant. Of the data in the remaining

       two files, the defendant shared only the identity and contact information of the

       respective controllers.

       The complainant disputed that the data he was given access to was complete. He asked

       namely that the defendant also had the “purpose of the credit” and an image

       of his identity card. He once again requested the defendant “to provide the files you as

       lender \[sic\] has in your possession, as you inform me, to transfer to me.” The complainer

       had also filed a complaint with the defendant's financial services ombudsman, and
       the documents available to the Disputes Chamber show that communication between the

       defendant and the complainant focused mainly on the rest for a certain period of time

       investigating the substantive reasons for the refusal of the credit, which is outside the

       scope of this decision. After some time, the complainant made contact again

       contacted the defendant to ask for confirmation that he had been given access to all

       his personal data. The defendant responded as follows:

                "Dear,

                We have other data in our possession, namely the one we received in the context

                of your complaint to the financial services ombudsman.

 3. On January 8, 2024, the complaint will be declared admissible by the First Line Service on the grounds

       of Articles 58 and 60 of the WOG and the complaint is filed on the basis of Article 62, § 1 of

       the WOG has been transferred to the Disputes Chamber.

 4. In accordance with Article 95, § 2, 3° of the WOG as well as Article 47 of the internal regulations

       order of the GBA, the parties can request a copy of the file. If one

       both parties wish to make use of the opportunity to consult and

       copying the file, he or she must contact the secretariat of the

       Disputes Chamber, preferably via litigationchamber@apd-gba.be. Decision 32/2024 — 3/7

II. Justification

 5. According to Article 15.1 GDPR, the data subject has the right to obtain from the

      controller to obtain clarity about whether or not to process

      personal data concerning him and, if applicable, to obtain access to it
      those personal data and the information referred to in Article 15.1.a) to h), GDPR.

      In accordance with Article 12.1 GDPR, read in conjunction with recital 58 hereof

      Regulation, the controller must take appropriate measures to ensure that
      the data subject the communications referred to in Article 15 GDPR in connection with the processing

      in a concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible form and in

      receives clear and simple language”. Article 12.2 GDPR also stipulates that the

      controller must exercise the data subject's rights

      facilitate.

 6. The Disputes Chamber notes that the complainant submitted his request for access on 6

      October 2023.

 7. On October 17, 2023, the defendant informed the complainant that in the investigation of his

      file, three files were consulted. These files were those of (1) the

      defendant itself, (2) the Central Office for Credit to Private Individuals, and (3) a

      financing company. The same email contained, according to the defendant, “a complete

      content of the data contained in our files”. However, the complainant disputed
      that this information was complete. In particular, he stated that the defendant would also

      have the “purpose of the credit”.

      On December 26, 2023, the complainant asked the defendant to confirm that he had access
      had received in all his personal data. The defendant responded that also “other

      data” were processed, and referred to the data provided by the complainant

      provides financial services in the context of his complaint to the Ombudsman

      defendant. Since the defendant did not directly answer the question of the

      complainant whether he had been given access to all his personal data, the complainant did not obtain any

      clear information about whether or not certain personal data are processed.
      Consequently, the complainant has not been provided with sufficient clarity or insight as required in Article

      15.1 GDPR.

 8. Furthermore, the complainant states that the defendant has an image of his identity card
      processed, and failed to provide a copy of it in response to the

      request for inspection. In this context, the Disputes Chamber recalls that Article 15.3 GDPR

      provides that the controller “a copy of the personal data that

      are processed” must be provided to the data subject. If the defendant indeed Decision 32/2024 — 4/7

       processes an image of the complainant's identity card, the defendant must also have one

       provide a copy of this image to satisfy the complainant's right of inspection.

 9. Regarding the two other files that the defendant consulted, communicated

       the defendant only the identification details and addresses of the respective

       controllers. The results of the consultations by the defendant –

       namely the contents of the files – the defendant did not communicate this to the complainant. At

       the latter was told to contact the administrators of that

       files to exercise his right of access. To the extent that the defendant

       determines the purposes and means of the processing of the personal data concerned
       However, he is a data controller and is therefore obliged to follow up himself

       the complainant's right of access in accordance with Article 15.1 GDPR. In this respect it is

       appropriate to recall that the aim of the right of access is to ensure that

       the data subject “can inform himself of the processing and its lawfulness

       can check this” (recital 63 GDPR). The right of access thus supports it

       right to the protection of personal data, and facilitates the exercise of others

       rights included in the GDPR, and in particular the right to rectification. Without

       access to the data that the defendant did or did not consult with the two parties involved

       files, the complainant is unable to determine whether it is necessary to contact them

       with those responsible for those files to assert his right to rectification.

       Furthermore, it should be noted that Article VII.79 of the Code of Economic Law

       stipulates that the “lender shall immediately provide the consumer with the result of the loan free of charge

       consultation \[communicates\] as well as the identity and address of the person responsible for the

       processing the files he consulted” (emphasis added).

 10. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that based on the above analysis

       concluded that the defendant may have violated the provisions of the GDPR
       was committed, which justifies taking one in this case

       decision on the basis of Article 95, § 1, 5° of the WOG, more specifically the

       order the controller to comply with the exercise by the

       complainant of his right of access (Article 15.1 GDPR).

 11. This decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Disputes Chamber

       in accordance with Article 95 of the WOG on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant,
                                                                                      2
       in the context of the “procedure prior to the decision on the merits” and none

       Article 95, § 1, 5° of the WOG, to order the defendant to comply with the request

       of the data subject to exercise his rights, in particular the right of access such as

       determined in Article 15 GDPR.

 12. The purpose of this decision is to inform the defendant of the fact that this

       may have committed an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR and this in the

       the opportunity to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.

 13. If the defendant does not agree with the content of the present primafacie

       decision and is of the opinion that it can apply factual and/or legal arguments

       that could lead to a different decision, this can be done via the e-mail address
