## English Summary

### Facts

The DPC commenced an inquiry after UCD notified the DPC of seven personal data breaches.

The breaches involved instances where unauthorised third parties accessed UCD email accounts, or where the login credentials for UCD email accounts were posted online

### Dispute

Did the breaches reported by UCD infringe Articles 5(1)(f)- 5(1)(e) and 33(1) GDPR?

### Holding

The DPC held that UCD infringed:

\- Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) GDPR by failing to process personal data on its email service in a manner that ensured appropriate security of the personal data using appropriate technical and organisational measures.

\- Article 5(1)(e) GDPR by storing certain personal data in an email account in a form which permitted the identification of data subjects for longer than necessary for the purpose for which the personal data were processed.

\- Article 33(1) GDPR by failing to notify one of the personal data breaches to the DPC without undue delay. The DPC noted that this personal data breach was notified 13 days after UCD became aware of it.

In addition to imposing an administrative fine on UCD of €70,000, the DPC also ordered UCD to bring its processing operations concerning its email service into compliance with Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) GDPR, and issued UCD with a reprimand in respect of the infringements.

## Comment

This is the first fine imposed on an Irish third-level institution and is the sixth GDPR fine imposed by the DPC. Previous fines imposed to Tusla, HSE and Twitter also included failure to implement appropriate security measures to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data and delay in notifying the DPC of a data breach and, in the case of Twitter, failure to adequately document a personal data breach.
