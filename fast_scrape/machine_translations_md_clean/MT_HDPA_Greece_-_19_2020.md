## English Summary

### Facts

Data subjects complained that they received SMSs from a candidate in municipal elections without having any previous relationship with her.

### Dispute

### Holding

The HDPA held that according to the GDPR and Article 11 of L. 3471/2006, in electronic political communication a politician is a data controller insofar as they determine the scope and means of processing, e.g. their personal political communication. Thus, the are bound by the principle of accountability.

Here, the politician failed to prove she obtained the complainants' consent and she offered the right to object to the political communication. Moreover the data subjects could not easily find the controller's details in order to exercise their rights.

Thus, the HDPA imposed the fine of € 2.500.
