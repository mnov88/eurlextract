## English Summary

### Facts

Following a series of reports and complaints against ICS, a subsidiary of ABN AMRO, as a controller, the Dutch DPA (_Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, AP_) decided to start an ex officio investigation into the processing operations carried out by the controller. The AP mainly received complaints concerning the controller's process of re-identifying its customers online by means of a new identification and verification tool, ID&V. The AP found that the controller never conducted a DPIA in 2018, prior to the introduction of its identification system, and asked the controller to provide its submissions on this.

The controller claimed in this respect that it did not need to carry out a DPIA, since the same identification system was used by ABN AMRO before, and ABN AMRO had previously carried out a risk assessment of its own authentication app. Moreover, the controller argued that when ID&V was introduced, there were no risks of potential misuse of personal data, and strict security measures were in place. Also, the controller argued that the only criterion that suggested the need to carry out a DPIA, according to [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR"), was the fact that the processing was large-scale, but no other criteria were given that would make its processing activities "high risk". Lastly, the controller claimed that it does not process any special categories of personal data within the meaning of [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR").

### Holding

The AP first of all assessed whether the controller’s processing operations presented a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The AP made this assessment in light of [Article 29 Working Party Guidelines 248 rev.01 on “Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is ‘likely to result in a high risk’ for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679”](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj5rKOm5PODAxUBbvEDHTkrDysQFnoECBAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fnewsroom%2Fdocument.cfm%3Fdoc_id%3D47711&usg=AOvVaw0fHA9krZ_2-wSysNMXoIyB&opi=89978449) and [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR") and it stated that in order for processing operations to be considered “high risk”, at least two of the criteria set out in [Article 35(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR#3 "Article 35 GDPR") must be met. In the case at hand, the AP considered that the processing operations carried out by the controller meet two of these criteria, namely, processing of sensitive data and large-scale processing. As a matter of fact, the controller processes several data about its customers, including ID number and photograph and the controller has around 1,5 million customers, who have all been required to re-identify using ID&V.

In light of this, the AP considered that the controller should have carried out a DPIA. With respect to the claim of the controller that its parent company, ABN AMRO, already assessed the risk of its authentication app and this exempted the controller to carry out its own DPIA, the AP again referred to the [Article 29 WP Guidelines](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj5rKOm5PODAxUBbvEDHTkrDysQFnoECBAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Fnewsroom%2Fdocument.cfm%3Fdoc_id%3D47711&usg=AOvVaw0fHA9krZ_2-wSysNMXoIyB&opi=89978449). The Guidelines foresee that a DPIA needs to comply with the minimum requirements of [Article 35(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR#7 "Article 35 GDPR"). The AP evaluated the assessment carried out by ABN AMRO and found that it mainly concerned risks related to fraud and money laundering and only three data protection related risks were included. However, the assessment did not contain any description of processing, nor a proportionality and necessity assessment, nor did it refer to the measures adopted to address the risks. Hence, the AP concluded that the controller’s evaluation of data protection risks in conjunction with ABN AMRO’s assessment cannot be considered to be equivalent to a DPIA under [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR"). For this reason, the AP held that the controller violated [Article 35(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR#1 "Article 35 GDPR").

In this, the AP considered it appropriate to impose a fine on the controller, in accordance with [Article 83 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR"). The AP made reference to the National Fine Policy of 2019 and to [EDPB Guidelines 04/22](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/documents/public-consultations/2022/guidelines-042022-calculation-administrative_en) when calculating the amount of the fine to be imposed. In its considerations, the AP gave importance to the fact that not conducting a DPIA constitutes a GDPR violation in itself, but it also increases the likelihood of further GDPR violations, as there is no understanding of the risks. Last, taking into account the annual global turnover of the whole ABN AMRO group, the AP decided to impose a fine in the amount of €150,000 on the controller.

Subject
Decides to impose an administrative fine for violating the General Regulation

Data protection

Dear members of the management,

The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) has decided to appoint InternationalCardServicesB.V. (ICS)
to impose an administrative fine of €150,000 (in words: one hundred and fifty thousand euros) for violation of
Article 35, first paragraph, of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is because ICS has
completed a data protection impact assessment (DataProtectionImpactAssessment; hereinafter:
DPIA).

This decision explains the administrative fine. This will be discussed in turn
reasons, the course of the proceedings, the facts established, the violation and the amount of the fine. Finally
follows the dictum.

                                                                                               1 Date Unmarked

1. BackgroundResearch

  1. ICS is a company based in Amsterdam and active in offering financial products in
      in particular the issuance of so-called debit and credit cards. 1

  2. The Customer Contact and Monitoring Investigation department of the AP has received signals and complaints about this
      consumers about ICS have started an investigation into a possible violation of the GDPR by ICS.Die
      complaints and signals were received by the AP after ICS started again (online) in 2019

      identifying its customers with the 'identification and verification process' (ID&V).

  3. The purpose of the investigation was to determine whether ICS complied with the rules laid down in Article 35 GDPR, when
      she did not carry out DPIA in preparation for the ID&V process.

2. Findings research reports process flow

  4. The findings of the investigation have been recorded in a report. It follows that upon the introduction of
      ID&Vspeaked of a processing of data that probably entails a high risk

      for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. ICSC also preceded the processing
      had to carry out a DPIA. The report concluded that ICS failed to carry out a DPIA
      In doing so, she acted in violation of Article 35, first paragraph, GDPR, according to the report.

                                                                           3
  5. The report was signed on 23 June 2022 and sent to ICS on 7 July 2022. ICSheeftop
      September 14, 2022 gave an opinion on the report. On October 20, 2022, ICS gave its opinion
      explained verbally.

  6. The AP asked ICS further written questions on 2 December 2022 and 13 February 2023, to which

      ICS responded on 21 December 2022 and 24 March 2023 respectively.

3. Legal framework

  7. To improve the readability of this decision, the relevant legal framework is included in Appendix 1.
      legal framework is part of this decision.

4. ICS view

  8. ICS has given the following view on the report.

  9. IC has set up an extensive risk process, called ChangeRiskAssessment (CRA process).
      In the CRA process, risks are identified, mitigated and monitored. A Privacy Impact
      Assessment is part of the CRA process and, when appropriate, becomes a DPIA

      executed.

  10. ICS is a 100% subsidiary of ABNAMRO. ABNAMRO has been using a
      application from MitekSystemsB.V. (Mitek app), to determine the identity of its customers.
      ABN AMRO also uses the CRA process to analyze and use risks

      Mitek app, ABNAMRO has done an extensive analysis of the use of the Mitek app. IC has
      the same technique was used to re-identify its customers. There was none for ICS
      reason to carry out another analysis, because ABNAMRO has already had an analysis
      executed.

  11. ICS further states that it has investigated whether additional measures have been included in the CRA process
      should be for ID&V. A Privacy Officer was involved in this at an early stage
      the nature and purpose of ID&V are determined. It has also been determined which data are processed, who
      has access to these data, which retention periods apply or are not applicable
      transfer outside the EU and measures taken for this transfer.

  12. Moreover, ICS states, when ID&V was introduced, there was no high risk of misuse of
      personal data. The personally identifiable data used at ID&V are not inherent
      sensitiveandnecessarytocomplywiththelegalrequirements.Whenprocessingthe
      citizen service number applies to the strictest security level, which is partly based on legislation

      financial sector. Furthermore, when collaborating with third parties, strict requirements are imposed on encryption
      using secure connections, carrying out penetration testing and meeting audit requirements
      controlofpersonaldata.

  13. ICShe has acknowledged that the PIA triage of August 28, 2018 incorrectly concluded that

      there was no large-scale processing of data. The PIA form has been available since 2020
      adjusted so that such an error will not occur again.

  14. According to ICS, there is no inequality of power between its customers and ICS, because ICS is legal
      obliged to identify its customers, the customers have the option to become non-digital

      identifyandacreditcardisnotanessentialpaymentservice.

                                                                                               3/20 Date Unmarked
      December 18, 2023 \[CONFIDENTIAL\]

  15. The Data Protection Officer (FG) of ICS has been directly involved via the Privacy Office
      data protection risks.ICS has not clearly communicated this circumstance before.

  16. The Decree on the list of processing and processing of personal data for which a DPIA is mandatory provides a
      number of criteria and of only one criterion, namely large-scale processing, is this case according to ICS
      in order to be able to draw the conclusion that processing probably poses a high risk to the

      involved, there must be two elements that are mentioned in the Decree. Now
      this was not the case, and ICS was also not obliged to carry out a DPIA
      the said decision was published after the start of the introduction of ID&V.

5. Assessment

5.1 Controller and authorityAP

  17. It is established and not in dispute that ICS is responsible for the processing (Article 4, opening paragraph 7, GDPR).
      and that the AP is the competent supervisory authority (Article 56, first paragraph, GDPR).

5.2 Obligation to implement DPIA

  18. In summary, it follows from the GDPR that a DPIA must be carried out before any processing
      where such processing is likely to involve a high risk to the rights and freedoms of

      natural persons (Article 35, first paragraph, GDPR).

  19. The Guidelines WP248rev.01 (hereinafter: the Guidelines) describe which criteria apply to
      question whether a DPIA should be carried out. The AP has taken into account the provisions in the GDPR (Article 35) and
                                             5
      in view of the aforementioned Guidelines and the Decree on the list of processing of personal data
      established (the Decree). That Decree stipulates, among other things, that for the processing of biometric data
      data aDPIA is mandatory.

  20. It is not in dispute that ICS did not carry out DPIA in 2018 prior to the introduction of ID&V.
      obligation to carry out a DPIA flows directly from Article 35, first paragraph, GDPR read
      in connection with the aforementioned Guidelines. The circumstance that it decides to stop
      November 27, 2019, established and published by the AP, does not mean that ICs for that reason

      DPIA should have been implemented. The Decision contains requirements that are also included in the GDPR Guidelines
      mentioned and result from it.

      4Guidelinesfordataprotectionimpactassessmentsanddeterminationwhetheraprocessing“islikelytohighrisk

      Dutch Data Protection Authority of 19 November 2019, Government Gazette 2019, 64418. This decision is based on the GDPR and the Guidelines WP
      248rev.01.

                                                                                                4/20 Date Unattribute
    December 18, 2023 \[CONFIDENTIAL\]

21. The first question that needs to be answered in this case is whether there is a type of processing that

    is likely to pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. When
    If this is the case, ICS is obliged to carry out a DPIA prior to implementation
    fromID&V.

22. From processing likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
    natural persons are the rules when two (of the nine) criteria are met

    the Guidelines are listed. In this case there are three criteria that are the Guidelines
    listed. This concerns: 1) sensitive data or data of a very personal nature; 2) on a large scale
    processed data; and 3) data relating to vulnerable data subjects.

23. It has been found that for ID&V the first and last name, date of birth, place of birth, address details,
    e-mail address, telephone number, gender, BSN, number of the ID document as well as the photo in it
                                                        6
    and a (liveness) photo of a data subject is processed. These data are, as follows
    Guidelines together qualify as sensitive data and data of a highly personal nature.

24. It has also emerged that ICS has approximately 1.5 million customers in the Netherlands who have had to register again
    identify and whose data ICS stores for as long as an involved customer remains with ICS. This

    in the opinion of the AP, this also means large-scale processing of
    personal data.

25. Contrary to what is described in the investigation report, the AP is conducting a further study of the facts of
    considers that in this case there is no question of vulnerable data subjects whose personal data are collected
    processed. Vulnerable persons involved can be children, but also employees or part of the
                                                                     9
    population that requires special protection, as follows from the Guidelines. It's basically because one
    unbalanced relationship between data subjects and controller. ICHS has that
    It has been rightly argued that a credit card is not an essential financial product for everyday life

    of a data subject. A credit card does not have the function of a bank account
    cannot be equated. This means that there is no question of an unbalanced relationship between ICS and her
    customers and therefore ICS customers cannot be regarded as vulnerable data subjects such as

    described in the Guidelines. Furthermore, it is not excluded that other providers of credit cards
    use a different method to identify their customers
    who are interested in a credit card over the choice of using services from other providers

    to make.

26. Since in any case two criteria from the Guidelines apply, there is a kind of
    processing that is likely to pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons
    persons. This means that carrying out a DPIA by ICS was mandatory.

27. According to ICS, she did not have to carry out a DPIA because the CRA process risks abuse of
    personal data have been analyzed and this process according to ICS to the extent that it can be compared to a DPIA.

    In view of this, the next question that needs to be answered is whether to equate the ICS CRA process
    isonaDPIA.

28. The AP assessment follows. The Guidelines provide criteria for an acceptable DPIA (not to be confused
    with criteria for assessing whether a DPIA should be carried out). It is then together
    controller must choose a method by which the set criteria are met.

    The controller is obliged to meet the (main and sub) criteria. This must be done:

    1. a systematic description of the processing is given;

    2. the necessity and proportionality of the processing are assessed;
    3. the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects are managed;
    4. the interested parties (their representatives) and the data protection officer (FG)
        be involved. For example, the advice of the FG must be won or must be sent to the

        opinions of those involved are asked.

29. ICS has used ABN-AMRO's CRA process. ABN-AMRO's CRA process

    consists of 22 risks (threats) with associated code. The vast majority of the described
    risks are directly or indirectly related to combating fraud and complying with the Prevention Act
    of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (Wwft). Only three risks (riskkeyr007, r011, r025)

    relate to the protection of personal data. ICS therefore complies with one of them
    main criteria from the Guidelines mentioned above in edge number 28, namely the third
    criterion: “management of risks to the rights and freedoms of those involved”. The CRA process of ABN-

    AMRO was not sufficiently focused on the protection of personal data on the other three criteria,
    so that the CRA process is not complete enough to comply with GDPR.

30. ICS, in addition to ABN-AMRO's CRA process, does not have its own CRA process in April 2020
    executed. This CRA process also provides a systematic description of the processing
    it has not appeared that the necessity and proportionality of the processing has been assessed, in particular

    measures that contribute to the protection of the rights of those involved. That is not in addition
    it has become apparent that interested parties, their representatives and not the official
    data protection are involved in the processing. The FG of ICS was therefore unable to provide advice

                                                                                             6/20 Date Unmarked

      about carrying out a DPIA. This means that ICS has three out of four (main) criteria for one
      acceptableDPIAhas not been tested.

  31. From the foregoing it follows that the criteria mentioned in the Guidelines for an acceptable
      DPIAhave not been applied in the CRA process of ICS. The CRA process of ICS, viewed in conjunction with
      that of ABN-AMRO, in the opinion of the AP, therefore cannot be equated with a DPIA. The CRA-

      processes of ICS and ABN-AMRO were mainly aimed at preventing and combating
      (identity) fraud and are not (also) specifically aimed at the protection of data.3

  32. Furthermore, the PrivacyImpact Assessment Triage of 18 June 2019, as part of the CRA process
      This did not result in a DPIA being carried out because those triages and injustices were not recognised
      it concerns large-scale processing.

  33. The AP is of the opinion that ICS should have carried out a DPIA. By failing to do so, ICS has Article 35,
      first paragraph, GDPR violated. The AP sees reason to impose a fine.

6. Administrative fine

  34. The AP is based on Article 58, second paragraph, at the beginning and under i, in conjunction with Article 83 GDPR
      read in conjunction with Article 14, third paragraph, UAVG, the authority to impose an administrative fine.

  35. It has been concluded in paragraph 33 that ICS has wrongly carried out a DPIA and
      has therefore violated Article 35, first paragraph, GDPR. This means that there has been one conduct
      for which a fine will be imposed.

6.1 Systematics for determining the amount of the fine

  36. When exercising the power to impose an administrative fine, the APight applies to both
      Policy rules of the AP regarding determining the amount of administrative fines (Stcrt.2019,
      14586)(hereinafter: Fine policy rules) as theGuidelineonthecalculationofadministrativefinesundertheGDPR
      (hereinafter: Guidelines). This is in accordance with what is stated in the explanation

      Fine policy rules on establishing joint principles regarding the calculation
      of fines and temporary nature of the AP's policy on this.

      1Appendix3,p.12, research report.
      1There is currently no Dutch translation of the Guidelines available. The Guidelines can be consulted at<
      https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/general-guidance/guidelines-recommendations-best-practices\_en>.

                                                                                               7/20 Date Unattribute

  37. The amount of the fine will be determined as follows:

         1. Determining the starting amount of the fine based on the Fine Policy Rules 2019;
         2. Consideration of the circumstances based on the Penalty Policy Rules;

         3. Consideration of the circumstances based on the Guidelines;
         4. Determining the amount of the fine and assessing effectiveness, proportionality and deterrence.

  38. These parts are discussed in turn below.

6.2 Determine the starting amount based on Fine Policy Rules 2019

  39. As mentioned above, in this case the starting point is the applicable bandwidth

      of the Fine policy rules. The AP is responsible for determining the amount of the fine, without prejudice to
      Articles 3:4 and 5:46 of the General Administrative Law Act, take into account the factors mentioned in Article 7 of the

      Fine policy rules. These factors are also described in Article 83, second paragraph, GDPR in the Guidelines
      appointed.

  40. For a violation of Article 35, first paragraph, GDPR, the AP may impose an administrative fine up to
      amount of €10,000,000. In the case of a company, a fine of up to 2% of

      the total worldwide annual turnover in the previous financial year, if this figure is higher. The AP notes that
      the total worldwide annual turnover of the parent company of ICS will amount to €7.841 billion in 2022, and that
      the maximum legal fine therefore amounts to €156.8 million.

  41. Under the Fine Policy Rules, an infringement is classified into a category according to the
      violation of the provision, ranging from category I to IV. The following applies: how important the provision is

      for the protection of personal data, the higher the category of infringement
      Fine policy rules state that violations of Article 35, first paragraph, GDPR fall into category II. The

      bandwidth of this category runs from €120,000 to €500,000, with a basic fine of
      € 310,000. This amount will be taken as a starting point for the further calculation of the
      final fine, after considering the relevant factors.

6.3 Consideration of the circumstances based on the Penalty Policy Rules

  42. When determining the amount of the fine, the relevant circumstances will be discussed in this case
      assessed on the basis of the factors mentioned in Article 7 of the Fine Policy Rules.

    December 18, 2023 \[CONFIDENTIAL\]

43. One of these factors is the severity of the violation. In determining this, each case is taken into account
    taken into account the nature, severity and duration of the infringement. Other circumstances that in any case
    is taken into account, are the categories of data concerned and whether there is a

    infringement which is inherently intentional or negligent.

44. The following is relevant for this purpose. The obligation to carry out a DPIA is intended for the process
    to describe the processing of data, so that not only the necessity and proportionality

    of the processing are mapped, but also the risks for the rights and freedoms of
    those involved in the processing of personal data. Failure to carry out a DPIA is an end to this
    itself (therefore) a violation of the GDPR, while it also increases the chance of violation again
    violations of the GDPR because risks of possible (other) violations of the GDPR are not identified in time
    recognized.

45. It is further relevant to determine the seriousness of the violation that ICS personal data of a
    large number of parties involved, namely 1.5 million customers. This fact contributes to the seriousness of
    the violation.The AP has marked the data that ICS has processed as sensitive

    data and data of a very personal nature. At the same time, the AP takes into account the
    circumstance that ICS has started the process of re-identifying its customers based on a
    obligations arising from the Wwft. When complying with them, the AP did not find that ICS
    the DPIA referred to has not been carried out on purpose. In the opinion of the AP, there is a case of negligence.

    The failure to carry out a DPIA was due to an incorrect assessment by ICS
    combating fraud and complying with the Wwft as guiding principles, but in that context
    ICs also had to independently assess GDPR compliance. The AP weighs the element
    negligence in this case as “neutral”, because it cannot be said that ICS by not executing
    a DPIA has not been compliant at all, in which context the AP ascribes significance to the

    circumstance that ICS does meet one of the main criteria in the application of the CRA process
    aforementioned Guidelines for an acceptable DPIA, namely the management of risks for the
    rights and freedoms of those involved. To this extent, ICS has paid (some) attention to
    the aforementioned risks that may arise when processing data.

46. It has been established that ICS has wrongly carried out a DPIA. To determine the severity of the
    violation, the AP does take into account the circumstance that ICs the aforementioned CRA process
    carried out at the start of re-identifying its customers. Part of that process is,

    as ICS has put forward in its views, a Privacy Impact Assessment, in which
    Privacy Officer is involved. During data assessment it is determined which data are processed,
    who has access to these data, what retention periods apply and whether they apply
    of transfers outside the EU and measures taken for this transfer. IC, like the AP
    has also considered this and has taken into account the risks to the rights and freedoms

    those involved in the processing of personal data, but have not sufficiently recognized that this
    should have led to the execution of a DPIA.

                                                                                            9/20 Date Unmarked

      December 18, 2023 \[CONFIDENTIAL\]

  47. The AP has the other circumstances as mentioned in Article 7, underk, Fine Policy Rules
      taken into consideration. The AP has taken into account other circumstances during the long period of time in between
      publishing the investigation reports and issuing an enforcement decision. This section
      has been designated as a mitigating factor with regard to the amount of the fine.

  48. Furthermore, no other circumstances mentioned in Article 7 of the Fine Policy Rules have emerged
      and views on the infringement by ICS, have occurred.

  49. Taking the foregoing circumstances into account, the AP is of the opinion that this case is serious

      this infringement must be qualified at a low level.

6.4 Consideration of the circumstances based on the Guidelines

  50. The European Data Protection Committee adopted the final text of
      the Guidelines. As mentioned above, the EDPB has established common principles
      regarding the calculation of fines for violations of the GDPR.

  51. The Guidelines describe a methodology in which the following is considered:

         1. What and how many acts and infringements are under assessment;
         2. Which starting amount is the starting point for calculating the fine for this;

         3. Whether mitigating or aggravating circumstances arise, it is open to adjustment
             amountexit2;
         4. What maximum amounts apply to the violations and any increases from the previous ones
             stepnotexceedthisamount;

         5. Whether the final amount of the calculated fine meets the requirements of effectiveness,
             deterrence and proportionality, and if necessary, adjusted accordingly.

  52. The number of actions that resulted in infringements of the GDPR and the starting amount for
      penalty calculation are already qualified under paragraph 6.2.

  53. As well as the Fine Policy Rules, write the Guidelines before the AP considers whether to soften or
      are aggravating circumstances that may lead to an adjustment in the classification of the infringement.
      This must be done on the basis of the circumstances stated in Article 83, second paragraph,
      salutationsunderatotenwithk,AVG.

                                                                                              10/20 Date Unmarked
      December 18, 2023 \[CONFIDENTIAL\]

  54. First of all, attention should be paid to the gravity of the infringement. Here is an account

      taken into account the nature, severity and duration of the infringement, as well as the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement
      infringements and categories of the processed personal data. These are in marginal numbers 43 to 46
      factors have already been discussed. This has led to the fact that in edge number 49, the severity of the infringement is not low

      gets qualified.

  55. The Guidelines are written before taking into account the size of the company from the point of view of fairness

      must be taken into account when calculating the amount of the fine. The size of the company is determined
      based on turnover. According to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union,
      the turnover of the entire group is used to determine the upper limit of the fine. ICSis

      a wholly owned subsidiary of ABN-AMRO. Therefore, the size of the company will become
      determined on the basis of ABN-AMRO's worldwide turnover. ABN-AMRO has a turnover in 2022

      achieved €7.841 billion. Since ABN-AMRO's turnover is higher than €156.8 million20, he writes
      AVNo maximum fine of 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover for.

  56. Then write the Guidelines for the other circumstances from Article 83 GDPR
      are taken.As already mentioned, the partsctoandwithfthepartshtoandwithj
      Article 7 of the Fine Policy Rules was not found to be relevant in the case of ICS. These parts

      correspond to the prescribed components that must be observed under the
      Guidelines and are therefore not relevant in the case of ICS.

  57. The AP has the other circumstances as mentioned in Article 7, underk, Fine Policy Rules
      taken into consideration. This provision corresponds to Article 83, second paragraph, subsection, GDPR
      As other circumstances, AP has taken into account the long period of time between publishing it

      investigation reports and the issuance of an enforcement decision. This section is under paragraph 6.2
      classified as mitigating with regard to the amount of the fine.

6.5 Determining the amount of the fine and assessing effectiveness, proportionality and deterrence

  58. In this case, the amount of the fine will, however, be determined by applying the basic fine from the
      concerningcategoryoftheFinepolicyrules.Otherwiseandasoutlinedabove,thiswill
      specific case, the amount of the fine on the basis of both the Fine Policy Rules and the Guidelines, up to

      lead to the same outcome.

  59. In this case it concerns an infringement for which category II of the Fine Policy Rules applies.

      The fine bandwidth for category II is between €120,000 and €500,000.

  60. Finally, it must be assessed whether the fine is effective, proportionate and deterrent. Based on
      Article 49 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU may impose an administrative fine, given that
      circumstances of the concrete case do not lead to a disproportionate outcome. This has also been stated

      in Articles 3:4 and 5:46, second paragraph, General Administrative Law Act.

  61. Pursuant to Article 83, fifth paragraph, opening words under b, GDPR, the AP can apply for the above
      violations to impose an administrative fine. The purpose of imposing an administrative fine can be

      are located on the one hand in punishing unlawful behavior and on the other hand in promoting it
      compliance with applicable regulations.

  62. Considering the nature, severity and duration of the infringement, as well as other factors from Article 83, second paragraph,
      GDPR, as assessed in this chapter, includes the imposition of an administrative fine under this

      circumstances have an effective and deterrent effect. Furthermore, it has not been established that the violation ICS
      cannot be blamed.

  63. In view of all the above circumstances, the AP concludes that a fine of €150,000
      for a violation of failure to execute a DPIA (Article 35, first, GDPR), in which case appropriate
