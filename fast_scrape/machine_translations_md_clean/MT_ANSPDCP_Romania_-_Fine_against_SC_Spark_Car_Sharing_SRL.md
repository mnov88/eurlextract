## English Summary

### Facts

The Romanian DPA started an investigation against a controller (a car sharing company), after one of the controller's customers filed a complaint. The data subject reported to the authority that they received several unsolicited marketing communications, even after they submitted a data deletion request with the controller, request which was acknowledged and confirmed by the controller.

### Holding

During the investigation the controller was unable to prove that it processed the email address of its customers to send commercial communications in a lawful manner. As such, the Authority concluded that the controller processed the email addresses of their customers for direct mkt purposes without any legal basis (neither consent or another suitable legal basis) in breach of GDPR Articles 5(1)a and b, 6(1) and 7.

Additionally, the Authority identified that the controller continued to process the personal data of one data subject for direct marketing purposes, even after their deletion request was received, in breach of GDPR Article 17.

The controller was fined approximately EUR 1,000 and the Authority applied a corrective measure, requesting the controller to establish data processing practices in line with the consent requirements, when consent is the required legal basis.
