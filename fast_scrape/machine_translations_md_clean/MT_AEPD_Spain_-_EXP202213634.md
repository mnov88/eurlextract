## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject opened a “non-payroll” bank account, one which does not require proof of income, with ING Bank Spain (controller). In 2022, the controller informed her that her account would be reclassified as a “non-account account” if her balance exceeds €30,000 and recommended she open a “non-account account”, different account offering from the bank, and split her balance between the two. In order to open this other account, however, the controller required she provided consent for the controller to contact the General Treasury of the Social Security to verify the origin of funds to be deposited. The controller claimed this was necessary to comply with Spanish money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws.

A clause giving consent for this processing was included in a document containing pre-contractual information, to which the data subject had to click “confirm”.

The anti-money laundering law in question, Law 10/2010, requires the verification of origin of funds where prospective clients either present higher than average risks arising from a provision or the bank’s own risk analysis, or, where prospective client’s banking records do not correspond to their declared activity or operating history.

On 3 November 2022 the data subject filed a complaint with the AEPD (Spanish DPA). She argued that she falls into neither of the categories envisaged by Law 10/2010 and the controller is using it as an excuse to make the data subject give her consent.

The controller argued that consent being sought in this context does not equate to the concept of consent under the GDPR. They noted that they rely on their legal obligation under [Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1c "Article 6 GDPR") for this processing, and the collection of the consent is to satisfy the envisaged requirement of getting “authorisation” from the prospective account holder, as envisaged in the money laundering law. The controller further argued that the verification of origin of funds by the Treasury is the only meaningful way, given the technologies available, for them to comply with their general obligation to implement fraud prevention methods.

Following initiation of the investigation, the controller updated their privacy policy to list their legitimate interest under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") as a basis for the processing.

### Holding

The DPA found that the cited anti-fraud provision did not, contrary to the controller’s claims, impose a general obligation to verify client’s submitted information with the Treasury. It is only where the level of risk is assessed to be sufficiently high where financial institutions are obliged to implement procedures to verify submitted financial activities. The DPA found, therefore, that the controller could thus not rely on [Article 6(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") GDPR to legitimise the processing, and would need to have obtained valid consent consistent with [Article 4(11) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#11 "Article 4 GDPR").

The DPA also rejected the controller’s assertion that the term “authorisation” under the money laundering law was different than the consent required under the GDPR.

The DPA ruled that the consent collected was invalid and would not suffice to legitimise the processing under [Article 6(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") GDPR. The DPA reasoned that in order to create the account, the data subject had to click on the confirm checkbox. There was also no alternative means of verification of funds provided. In support of their conclusion, the DPA referenced the [EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en) which notes that data subjects should be given control and a real choice as to whether they accept or refuse the conditions offered, and that consent should not be included as a non-negotiable part of general terms and conditions.

The DPA also held that the controller could not rely on their legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for this processing activity. Referencing the three requirements for the lawful basis to apply in [Opinion 06/2014 of the Article 29 Working Group](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp217_en.pdf), the DPA found that fundamental rights of customer would be unduly affected, and the controller was thus not entitled to rely on their legitimate interest in the circumstances. The DPA also made reference to [EDPB Guidelines 05/2020](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en) which states that controllers cannot move from consent to other legal bases and cannot seek to rely on their legitimate interest to retrospectively legitimise the processing activity.

The DPA concluded, therefore, that the controller had infringed [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") for processing without a lawful basis. In determining the appropriate sanction, the controller was influenced by the controllers high turnover and the broad scope of the processing activity in question. The fine was initially set at €2,000,000 but pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine and waive their right to appeal. This action reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to make a voluntary payment and reduced the fine by 20%, paying the reduced sanction amount of €1,600,000.

 File No.: EXP202213634

RESOLUTION TERMINATING THE PROCEDURE DUE TO VOLUNTARY PAYMENT

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On March 27, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against ING BANK N.V., BRANCH IN SPAIN (hereinafter, ING). After notification of the initiation agreement and after analyzing the allegations presented, the following draft resolution was issued on February 10, 2025:

<<

File No.: EXP202213634

PROPOSED RESOLUTION FOR SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following:

BACKGROUND

FIRST:
A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complainant) filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency on November 3, 2022. The complaint is directed against ING BANK N.V., BRANCH IN SPAIN (hereinafter, ING) with Tax Identification Number (NIF)

W0037986G. The reasons for the claim are as follows:

The complainant opened a "Non-Payroll Account" with the respondent years ago. He states that, a few months ago, the entity informed him that his account would be renamed "Non-Account Account" and that if its balance exceeded €30,000 (as was the case), fees would be applied. Therefore, they recommended that he open another "Non-Account Account" and divide the balance between the two.
Therefore, the claimant was transferring a balance whose origin was justified at the time. However, it states that, as a requirement for opening the new account, the respondent party requires that it provide its express consent for said entity, on its behalf, to request information about its economic activity from the General Treasury of Social Security, conduct a verification of said activity, and thus comply with the provisions of Law 10/2010, of April 28, on the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism (LPBCFT). Along with the complaint, a screenshot is provided (dated November 3, 2022) regarding the contract for the "No Account Account" (Cuenta no Cuenta).
This statement indicates that to finalize the contract, "you must consult and download the pre-contractual information and the commission information document."
Then, a clause is added indicating that the client confirms express consent for ING to request information about their economic activity from the Social Security Treasury (TGSS), by means of a "confirm" button. It also adds that, "By clicking Accept, you confirm and accept that you have read the Service Provision Contract and its Annexes..."

The complainant claims that ING indiscriminately and disproportionately collects data from its clients regarding their status with the General Treasury of Social Security, in application of a misinterpretation of the LPBCFT (Spanish Constitutional Law on the Protection of Personal Data), given that Royal Decree 111/2020 (Regional Decree 111/2020) states that the contract is indiscriminately and disproportionately collecting data from its clients regarding their status with the General Treasury of Social Security (TGSS), based on a misinterpretation of the LPBCFT (Spanish Constitutional Law on the Protection of Personal Data). 304/2014, of May 5, approving the Regulations of Law 10/2010,

of April 28, establishes that "obligated parties shall review the activities declared by clients in the following cases:

a) When the client or the business relationship presents higher-than-average risks, due to a regulatory provision or because this is evident from the obliged party's risk analysis.

b) When monitoring of the business relationship shows that the client's active or passive operations do not correspond to their declared activity or their operational history."

Given that the complainant is not in either case a) or b), they consider that ING is using the LPBCFT (General Data Protection Act) as an excuse to have an authorization signed, thus violating principles protected by the Constitution and the Data Protection Act.

Furthermore, in its complaint, it considers that ING violates fundamental rights by including, in order to finalize the account openings, a clause authorizing it to request information from the General Treasury of Social Security on behalf of clients:

ING Clause: "I confirm that I have been informed by ING BANK N.V., Branch in Spain, that current legislation on the prevention of money laundering requires banking entities to obtain information on their clients' economic activity and to conduct a verification thereof. For the sole purpose of verifying the information provided, I give my express consent to ING BANK N.V., Branch in Spain, to request such information from the General Treasury of Social Security on my behalf. The data obtained from the General Treasury of Social Security will be used exclusively for the purposes indicated above. In the event of non-compliance with this obligation by the entity and/or the personnel who provide services there, all actions provided for in Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights will be executed."

SECOND:
In accordance with Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), this complaint was forwarded to ING so that it could analyze it and inform this Agency within one month of the actions taken to comply with the requirements set forth in the data protection regulations.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), was recorded on January 9, 2023, as recorded in the acknowledgment of receipt included in the file.

On February 8, 2023, this Agency received a response letter indicating the following aspects:

- Your data protection officer has not prepared a specific report on the processing consisting of the verification of the employment data of clients/potential clients, but rather that it is included in a broader process called the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Process. It also states that the system used to share information for the employment verification of its clients is periodically monitored by its security department.

- It considers that it is not necessary to take action regarding the complaint filed, citing the agreement signed between the TGSS, the Spanish Banking Association, the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives on the transfer of information, to justify the provision of the clause in question.

It continues by acknowledging that the clause copied by the complainant in its complaint is indeed part of the contracting process for both the Salary Account and the Non-Account Account (without payroll), explaining the process to be followed. Thus, it details that, after accessing the website www.ing.es, once the customer selects the Salary Account or the Non-Account Account, the first thing they are asked to provide is their email address, their ID number, and their date of birth. Subsequently, they are asked for other personal information such as their full name, nationality, marital status, and address.

The employment information screen will then appear, where you will be asked for your employment status, professional activity, sector, company, monthly income,

purpose of the main relationship, and source of funds. The clause will appear, requesting consent for verification of the employment information provided with the General Treasury of Social Security (TGSS). This information can also be found in the Privacy Policy for clients and potential clients, which can be consulted on the website www.ing.es, under the "Privacy and Cookies" section, and in the Service Provision Contract for clients.

The wording of the clause is a mandatory text provided by the TGSS to entities that wish to use its verification service and that have voluntarily adhered to the Agreement mentioned below. Annex III contains the model clause to be used.

On January 17, 2008, the Spanish Banking Association (AEB), the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives (UNACC) signed an agreement with the TGSS on the transfer of information in order to facilitate credit institutions' compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, through a mechanized computer procedure that allows for the establishment of a daily process for data requests from financial institutions and for the transmission of information by the TGSS. This agreement was signed again, in its latest version, in March 2021.

This service is called the Source of Income Verification Service (SVFI), whose main objective is to verify the veracity of the information that financial institutions collect from their clients in order to understand the nature of their professional or business activity, and that clients provide when establishing business relationships. It is a daily process through which the financial institution sends a file with the identification of its individual clients, requesting information about the nature of their professional or business activity derived from their Social Security affiliation. The TGSS processes these files daily, completing the required information.

Using the NIF (Tax Identification Number) provided by the client, ING consults the TGSS and verifies the information provided in the employment status field (all clients) and, subsequently, the payer's information (medium/high-risk clients). ING does not request
any other information from the TGSS, neither the client's employment history nor any other information other than that which we already have because it has been provided by the client. It merely verifies
that the information provided by the client is true and is intended to comply

with a legal obligation.

As the Agreement itself indicates, the specific purpose of this service that the TGSS
provides to member entities is the following: "The transfer of information
from the TGSS databases to member entities of

AEB/CECA/UNACC has the exclusive purpose of verifying the veracity of the
information that financial institutions collect from their clients, in order
to understand the nature of their professional or business activity and that clients
provide when establishing business relationships."

THIRD:
On February 3, 2023, in accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act),
the claim filed by the complainant was admitted for processing.

FOURTH:

According to the information available on ING.es (ing.es/sobre-ing/sala-prensa/ing-impulsa-

su-crecimiento-resultados-anuales), ING Spain and Portugal has a turnover of 1,091,000,000 euros in 2023.

FIFTH:

On March 27, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the respondent, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 63 and 64 of the LPACAP (General Data Protection Regulation), for the alleged violation of Article

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/49

6.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), as defined in Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

SIXTH:
After notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP,
the respondent submitted a statement of allegations in which, in summary, it stated that:

1.- ABOUT THE ASSUMPTION

- The complainant has been an ING customer since December 2013 and in October 2023, she requested the opening of another current account, called "Non-Account Account." In accordance with the Anti-Money Laundering regulations, ING must identify and verify the customer.

- ING informs all its customers, including the complainant, that pursuant to the AML Regulations, they must provide information about their economic activity.

- ING, through the Spanish Banking Association, as a signatory to the
Agreement with the General Treasury of Social Security ("TGSS"), the
Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives

on the transfer of information (hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement"), is authorized to use a mechanized
procedure that allows financial institutions to verify information on
the economic activity of their potential clients through the TGSS, in order to
carry out the verification of the information required by the AML Regulations.

- Therefore, pursuant to the aforementioned Agreement and in compliance with the AML Regulations, ING verifies the economic activity of potential clients,
within the framework of opening a bank account, by consulting such data with the TGSS.

-In this specific case, the contract is made online (as is usual, as ING is an eminently digital bank). Therefore, the Complainant is informed of such processing, its legitimacy, and scope in the digital contracting process. The customer must click the "Continue" button as a sign that they have read the information about said processing and their desire to continue with the process.

Furthermore, this processing is disclosed in the Privacy Policy for customers and potential customers (section 3), which can be consulted at any time on the website www.ing.es, under the "Privacy and Cookies" section, and is also included in the Service Provision Agreement for customers.

As stated in the notification of the opening of the testing period, the bank's current privacy policy, which is posted on its website, has been completed.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/49

2.- DATA PROCESSING

Of all the data obtained directly from the data subject for the process of opening the payroll account and the non-account account, the only ones subject to subsequent verification are the "employment status" and "payer" data, the latter only when appropriate. ING does not verify or consult the client's employment history or any additional data that the TGSS may have.

The data obtained does not constitute sensitive or specially protected data, within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR, but rather constitutes basic economic data.

There is no processing or access to the data subject's data other than that already provided, so the impact on the data subject does not increase nor does it constitute more invasive processing.

Regarding the purpose of this verification, it is limited to verifying that the data provided by the interested party is correct, accurate, and truthful. Under no circumstances is this verification carried out or executed for purposes other than compliance with the AML Regulations. Thus, ING only verifies that the information provided by the client matches that contained in the TGSS database.

3.- ON THE NEED TO VERIFY DATA AND INFORMATION

PROVIDED BY CLIENTS TO THE TGSS

The obligation entrusted to banking institutions to verify the information

provided by clients or potential clients, in relation to their work activities, is materialized with the signing of the Agreement that allows them to verify the veracity of the information collected, based on the transfer of information
from the TGSS databases.

Using an alternative method to consulting the TGSS would constitute the

use of a less reliable, less secure system with a higher risk of fraud
(for example, the provision by the data subject themselves of documents that,
currently, are susceptible to fraudulent modification or alteration
using technologies available to any user, methods that would not allow
detecting or preventing the commission of illegal acts in terms of both AML and fraud).

In short, the verification of data with the TGSS carried out by ING is
covered by the AML Regulations themselves, and therefore, it is not possible
to consider such processing excessive or disproportionate, much less a violation of the GDPR. Furthermore, as already noted, neither ING nor
any financial institution has an alternative mechanism or tool that offers
guarantees superior to or equivalent to those provided by the Public Administration, through the TGSS.

4.- ON THE LAWFULNESS OF DATA PROCESSING CARRIED OUT BY ING

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/49

The data processing carried out by ING, consisting of the verification of data provided by customers within the framework of the Customer Identification and Knowledge Process, constitutes lawful processing within the meaning of Article 6 of the GDPR.

First, it is regulated and enabled by the Agreement signed between the General Treasury of Social Security, the Spanish Banking Association, the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives on the transfer of information, the latest version of which (currently in force) dates from 2021.

Contrary to what is indicated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD), the Resolution of April 12, 2021, of the General Technical Secretariat, publishing the Agreement between the General Treasury of Social Security, the Spanish Banking Association, the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives on the transfer of information, does not stipulate the need for financial institution customers to provide consent, within the meaning of Article 6.1 a) of the GDPR, to carry out the aforementioned verification, but rather refers to a mere authorization, as stated in Article 6.1 a) of the GDPR. As can be seen in the Sixth Clause of the Agreement:

“Sixth. Responsibility for the operation of the SVFI.

The Collaborating Financial Institutions adhering to this Agreement must adopt the necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data obtained by the SVFI and to guarantee its proper functioning. The Collaborating Financial Institutions adhering to this Agreement shall only be responsible for the electronic exchanges in which they participate and for the tasks they perform in accordance with the procedure described in Annex II. Furthermore, each Collaborating Financial Institution undertakes to ensure, with respect to each request it makes: a) That the requests relate to individuals who initiate business relationships with the Financial Institution or to individuals regarding whom, after a reasonable period of time, it becomes necessary to update their information. b) That, prior to the request for information by the Collaborating Financial Institution, it has the corresponding express authorization, signed by the interested party and agreed upon by the parties. (See Annex III)".

The Agreement not only establishes the term "authorization," a term that refers to and

allows execution in multiple documentary forms, but also alludes to the
agreement between the parties. That is, it subjects any protocol authorizing
the verification to the conditions agreed upon and accepted between ING and its
clients. The concept of authorization differs substantially from the express and specific consent required by the AEPD, within the meaning of Article 6 of the

LOPDGDD. It is true that, in certain contexts, these terms can be
used interchangeably, but their requirements and scope are clearly differentiated at the
legal level.

In the case at hand, ING, as Data Controller, does not base the data processing consisting of the verification of the financial information provided by the data subject before the TGSS on the consent of the data subject.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/49

The Convention refers to the concept of "consent" within the meaning of Article 1262 of the Civil Code, which establishes the provision of consent necessary to formalize a contract:

"Consent is manifested by the concurrence of the offer and the acceptance of the thing and the cause that constitute the contract. If the person making the offer and the person accepting it are in different places, consent exists from the moment the offeror becomes aware of the acceptance or from the moment the acceptor, having sent it, cannot ignore it without breaching good faith. In such a case, the contract is presumed to have been concluded in the place where the offer was made."

In contracts entered into through automated devices, consent is granted
from the moment acceptance is expressed."

It cannot be ignored that the provision of this consent by ING customers is contextualized within the framework of a banking product contract, so the authorization required corresponds to the consent that the interested party gives to accept the product at the contractual level and not in the sense of the consent established in the LOPDGDD. Therefore, the AEPD cannot refer to the need to obtain customer consent when what the Agreement establishes is the relevance of granting mere authorization.

The Data Controller is responsible for processing the data, as well as for adopting the measures required for this purpose. Therefore, it is also their responsibility to weigh, assess, and configure the data. In this sense, ING is responsible for assessing and designing the data verification process required by the AML/CFT Regulations.

Consequently, it is also the responsibility of the Data Controller, ING herein, to establish its legitimacy.

According to the analysis carried out by ING, consent does not constitute adequate legitimacy for data processing consisting of the verification of the financial data provided by clients to the extent required by the AML Regulations, as exhaustively justified in the Third Claim, nor does the Agreement governing its execution and interaction with the TGSS require it.

In this sense, Article 6.1 (c) of the GDPR, when regulating data processing legitimized by compliance with a legal obligation, does not require that the specific regulation that triggers its execution stipulate a specific method for obtaining the data or determine which data should be requested. Instead, it allows its processing when necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, such as, in the case at hand, the AML Regulation for ING:

“6.1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met: (...) c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the controller.”

The EDPB alludes both to the possibility of basing data processing for fraud prevention purposes on Article 6.1.c) regarding compliance with a legal obligation, and even to the legitimate interest (Article 6.1.f) of the Data Controller.
Thus, while both bodies agree on the use of legitimacy based on legal compliance, neither mentions the possibility of basing data processing for AML and fraud prevention purposes on the consent of the data subject.

To the extent that such verification is required under the LPBCFT, the only avenue available to obliged entities is through the TGSS, i.e., it is necessary for compliance with an obligation to which ING is subject. Otherwise, although the provision of documentation by the potential client or client could be considered an alternative to complying with the AML Regulations, it does not fulfill the obligation of ING and all financial institutions to implement effective fraud prevention measures, considering the current technologies and context. As this is the only measure that ensures the intervention of an independent and impartial entity, which authorizes the verification of the information provided by clients, we believe there is no similarly valid and efficient way or channel to comply with the regulations diligently, even when this channel is not expressly reflected in the AML Regulations. On the other hand, although compliance with a legal obligation exists as a basis for legitimacy, it must be taken into account that, in this case, both in the case of

ING and other actors in the financial system, not only does one of the conditions of Article 6 of the GDPR apply to legitimize the processing, but, as stated, there is also a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and financial crimes such as money laundering. Therefore, ING's processing of data for this purpose does not constitute an infringement classified under Article 83.5 of the GDPR, given that at least one of the bases for legitimacy applicable to this processing exists, as required by Article 6.1 of the GDPR.

5.- ON THE ABSENCE OF HARM TO DATA SUBJECTS

The data query with the TGSS (General Tax Authority) conducted by ING is merely a check that verifies the accuracy and veracity of the information provided by clients, as already noted, with the aim of complying with the AML Regulations.
Therefore, in no case does it constitute an additional information query. Thus, this query, which relates to data previously provided by the data subject, does not increase the impact of data processing on the data subject's privacy.

Therefore, in the case at hand, no impact is produced or generated on the protected legal asset. In fact, the only case in which this check would trigger consequences or have effects would be if the data subject provided the entity with false or untrue data.

In conclusion, the processing in question, consisting of data verification before the TGSS, does not cause any harm to the data subjects, and is also in compliance with data protection regulations.

6.- REGARDING THE LACK OF PROPORTIONALITY OF THE PROPOSED PENALTY

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/49

ING has demonstrated that it has acted with due diligence in implementing measures in the processes to verify the source of income of this company's clients and potential clients. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in the hypothetical

case that the Agency considers that there is any type of non-compliance, the penalty already included in the Initiation Agreement is, in any case, disproportionate, given the circumstances and content of the alleged violation, which ING categorically denies.

SEVENTH:
On January 14, 2025, the investigating judge agreed to conduct the following tests:

1. The claim filed by A.A.A.

and its documentation, the documents obtained and generated during the claim's admission phase, are hereby reproduced for evidentiary purposes.

2. Likewise, the allegations regarding the agreement initiating the aforementioned sanctioning procedure, submitted by ING BANK N.V., BRANCH IN SPAIN, and the accompanying documentation, are hereby reproduced for evidentiary purposes.

3. The entity's current privacy policy, which appears on its website, is being completed.

4. The privacy policy in force at the time of the complaint is requested.

EIGHTH:

On February 6, 2025, a written response to the notification of the taking of evidence was received. In this response, within the granted period and in compliance with the aforementioned procedure, the respondent attached the privacy policy requested by the Agency.

NINTH:
A list of documents included in the procedure is attached as an annex.

Based on the actions taken in this proceeding and the documentation in the file, the following have been established:

PROVEN FACTS

FIRST:
In accordance with the allegations to the initiation agreement submitted by ING on April 24, 2024, they state that, within the framework of the processing of personal data for the contracting of both the Payroll Account and the Non-Account Account, they collect personal data such as name and surname, nationality, marital status, address, employment status, professional activity, employment sector, company, monthly income, purpose of the main relationship, or source of funds, among others.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/49

"Subsequently, you will be asked for other personal information such as your first and last name, nationality, marital status, among others, and your address.

Once this information is provided, you will be taken to the employment information screen (listed in the report provided in section 4), where your employment information will be requested, and at that point the clause will be displayed. The mandatory information (marked with \*) requested from the client is indicated below, and the client must select one of the options from the drop-down menu:
- Employment status
- Professional activity
- Employment sector
- Company

- Monthly income
- Purpose of the main relationship
- Source of funds."

SECOND:

In the written allegations to the initiation agreement submitted by ING on April 24, 2024, they indicate, with respect to the claimant, that:

“1.- The claimant, A.A.A. (hereinafter, the “Claimant”), has been an ING customer

since December 2013, when she opened a bank account,
then called the “Non-Payroll Account.” In October 2023, the
Claimant requested the opening of another checking account, called
the “Non-Account Account.”

Likewise, in the document submitted by ING on February 8, 2023, as a result of the request for transfer of information, ING asserts that, as of the date of the response to the transfer, the claimant has contracted the following products:

“2.- CONTRACTED PRODUCTS
Operating: She currently has an active Payroll Account ending in

6532, opened in December 2013.
Cancelled: Payroll Account ending in 7663, opened and canceled in

THIRD:
In a letter dated February 8, 2023, following the request for transfer of information, ING states that,

“The clause that the A.A.A. copied in its complaint is, in fact, part of our contracting process for both the Salary Account and the Non-Account Account (without payroll), which has already been explained to the AEPD in other files. The report attached as Document No. 2, in section 4, includes the two screens within the digital contracting process for the Salary Account (and the Non-Account Account) in which this clause is included, in order to identify the moment and context in which this clause is shown to the person who wants to contract this product with C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/49

ING. In the case of ING, since contracts are primarily made through online means (as it is an eminently digital bank), this clause has been included in the digital contracting process, requiring the customer to click the "Continue" button as a sign of having read the information about said processing and their desire to continue with the process. (employment is ours)

FOURTH:

In a letter dated February 8, 2023, following the request for transfer of information, ING provided a document called DOC\_2\_Report.pdf, which included screenshots of "the payroll account contracting process (clause for verification of employment data with the TGSS)", explaining, based on the claimant's assumption, that when an interested party initiates the process to open a new account, the respondent requires them to provide their express consent for said entity, on their behalf, to request the General Treasury of Social Security information on your economic activity, conduct a review of it, and thus comply with the provisions of the LPBCFT.

The clause reads as follows:

"Furthermore, I confirm that I have been informed by ING BANK NV, Branch in Spain, that current legislation on the prevention of money laundering requires banking institutions to obtain information on their clients' economic activity and to conduct a verification of it. For the sole purpose of verifying the information provided, I give my express consent to ING BANK NV, Branch in Spain, so that it may request such information from the General Treasury of Social Security on my behalf. The data obtained from the General Treasury of Social Security will be used exclusively for the purposes indicated above. In the event of non-compliance with this obligation by the Financial Institution and/or its personnel, all actions provided for in Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights will be taken." (emphasis added)

According to the screenshot provided after the aforementioned clause, there is an option to "return" or "continue," without a specific checkbox to expressly provide or decline the required consent.

Said clause does not mention any alternative mechanism for verifying the information without having to provide the required express consent.

Furthermore, in the same document, they indicate that,

"Subsequently, before formalizing the account contract and going through the various screens and phases (identification, etc.), the client is again shown the screen with the contract and the clause, which they must read before closing the contract."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/49

They provide a screenshot from the moment before closing the contract, which literally states that,

"By entering the code, you confirm your willingness to contract with ING, you confirm that you have consulted the Pre-contractual Information and the Commission Information Document, and that you have read and accept the Privacy Policy and the Service Provision Contract and its Annexes, which will not take effect until you complete your identification. In addition, you confirm your consent to identify yourself by recording with your device's camera, which may be stored and reviewed. Finally, you confirm your consent to us verifying your employment information through the General Treasury of Social Security." (emphasis added)

According to the screenshot provided, after the aforementioned clause, there is only one option: "continue."

FIFTH:
ING is a party to the "Agreement between the General Treasury of Social Security, the Spanish Banking Association, the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives on the transfer of information," signed on March 18, 2021, and published on April 12, 2021, in the Official State Gazette (BOE).

Thus, in the letter of February 8, 2023, submitted by the respondent

as a result of the request for transfer of information, ING states that,

"ING is one of the financial institutions currently adhering to the aforementioned Agreement. A copy of the aforementioned Agreement is attached as Document No. 1."

SIXTH:

The Agreement between the General Treasury of Social Security, the Spanish Banking Association, the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives on the Transfer of Information submitted establishes, with respect to its purpose, that:

“In this same sense, and with greater specificity regarding the purpose of this Agreement, Articles 5 and 6 of Law 10/2010, of April 28, on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, establish the following:

Article 5. Purpose and nature of the business relationship.

Obligated entities shall obtain information about the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship. In particular, obliged entities shall gather information from their clients in order to understand the nature of their professional or business activity and shall adopt measures aimed at reasonably verifying the veracity of such information.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/49

Such measures shall consist of establishing and implementing procedures for verifying the activities declared by clients. These procedures shall take into account the different levels of risk and shall be based on obtaining documents from clients related to the declared activity or obtaining information about it from outside the client.

Article 6. Continuous monitoring of the business relationship.

Obligated entities will apply continuous monitoring measures to the business relationship, including scrutinizing the transactions carried out throughout the relationship to ensure that they match the obliged entity's knowledge of the client and their business and risk profile, including the source of the funds, and ensuring that the documents, data, and information available are up-to-date.

The above legal provisions oblige entities and empower them to do the following:

- Adopt measures aimed at reasonably verifying the veracity of the activity declared by clients, and may obtain information from sources other than the client.

- Ensure that the documents, data, and information available are up-to-date.

- Establish "procedures for verifying the activities declared by clients." (emphasis added)

Thus, it provides that,

"FIRST.- Purpose of the Agreement. The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the terms and conditions under which the TGSS and the AEB/CECA/UNACC Associations will implement their collaboration for the proper functioning of the SVFI, as well as to define their respective responsibilities. The transfer of information from the TGSS databases to the AEB/CECA/UNACC member entities is for the sole purpose of verifying the veracity of the information that financial institutions collect from their clients in order to understand the nature of their professional or business activity and that clients provide when establishing business relationships.

The SVFI procedure is also described. Its fundamental objective is to verify the veracity of the information that financial institutions collect from their clients in order to understand the nature of their professional or business activity and that clients provide when establishing business relationships.

FIFTH.- Description of the SVFI

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/49

The SVFI procedure consists of a daily process by which The Collaborating Financial Institution, previously a member of the Agreement, sends a file via EDITRAN with the identification of the individuals,

clients with whom they establish a business relationship with the Entity, for
whom it requests information on the nature of the professional or business activity derived from their affiliation with Social Security.

The TGSS processes these files daily, completing the required information in the same file.

The parties will agree within the Monitoring Committee on certain details related to the execution of the agreement's content (such as
the issuance methods, details of the designs, and exchange data). In
that case, a modification of the agreement will not be required, but rather a simple agreement

between the parties, provided that it does not affect the minimum and essential content of the agreement, which cannot be modified by the Monitoring Committee.

Annex II contains the information exchange and its periodicity."

SEVENTH:

The Agreement between the General Treasury of Social Security, the Spanish Banking Association, the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives on the Transfer of Information, to which ING is a signatory, establishes the obligations of the signatory entities of the agreement and of the collaborating financial institutions, stating that,

"FOURTH.- Obligations of the AEB, CECA, and UNACC

The AEB, CECA, and UNACC undertake with respect to the Financial Entities associated with them:

(...)

c) Inform them that the requests they make to the TGSS, which in all cases will always require the signed authorization of the interested party, will refer exclusively to individuals who initiate business relationships with the Collaborating Financial Institution or to individuals, with respect to whom they are affiliated. which, after a reasonable period of time, require updating their information.

The authorizations signed by the interested party must be kept by the

Collaborating Financial Institutions and delivered to the TGSS or the Data Protection Agency, when requested, within ten days of their request.

SIXTH. Responsibility for the operation of the SVFI

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/49

The Collaborating Financial Institutions adhering to this Agreement
must adopt the necessary technical and organizational measures to
ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data obtained by the SVFI and

to guarantee its proper functioning.

The Collaborating Financial Institutions adhering to this Agreement
shall only be responsible for the telematic exchanges in which they participate and for the tasks they perform in accordance with the procedure
described in Annex II.

Likewise, each Collaborating Financial Institution is obliged to guarantee,
with respect to each request it makes:

a) That the requests relate to individuals who initiate business relationships with the Financial Institution or to individuals for whom,
after a reasonable period of time, it becomes necessary to update their information.

b) That prior to the request for information by the Collaborating Financial Institution, it has the corresponding express authorization,
signed by the interested party, and agreed upon by the parties. (See Annex III).

c) That it undertakes to safeguard the authorizations issued by the clients. For the purpose of control actions or audits carried out by the TGSS as the owner of transferred data, Financial Institutions are obliged to provide the
documentation in their possession within a period that may not exceed

ten calendar days from their request. This same period will also apply to
requests that, where applicable, may be made by the Data Protection Agency.

d) That it meets all the characteristics indicated in the security document (Annex I).

SEVENTH.- Adherence to the Collaborating Financial Institutions Agreement

Interested financial institutions may participate in the SVFI procedure provided for in this collaboration agreement,

assuming the rights and obligations that correspond to them under the terms and
conditions set forth therein, by signing the Deed of Adherence included in Annex IV of this agreement.

EIGHTH:

The Agreement between the General Treasury of Social Security, the Spanish Banking Association, the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives on the Transfer of Information, to which ING is a signatory, establishes in its ANNEX II and ANNEX III the requirement, as in the text of the agreement, of express authorization or consent so that the collaborating financial institution can verify whether the natural person for whom the appropriate authorization is held is registered as employed.

ANNEX II

Description: Exchange of information between the TGSS and the collaborating financial institutions to verify whether the person for whom the appropriate authorization is held is registered in the employment status.

For each record sent by the participating financial institutions that are members of AEB/CECA/UNACC, the TGSS will report, as of the date of the request, on their employment status. It may return one or more records depending on the number of employment statuses of the worker, either as a self-employed worker or as an employee in contribution accounts.

Period: Daily - Electronic exchange of files.

Both the means of submission and the design of the file sent by the collaborating financial institutions, as well as the response sent by the TGSS, will be determined at all times by the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Committee, regulated in Clause Ten of this Agreement.

The data obtained from the General Treasury of Social Security will be
used exclusively for the purposes indicated above. In the event

NINTH:

Through the privacy policy that could be consulted on the website at the time of the claim, ING informed its clients or potential clients that the legal basis for consulting the Social Security Treasury File to verify the employment information provided by a data subject was compliance with a legal obligation such as the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

"3.1 Purposes and legal bases for processing

Line 2 of the table containing the following:

Description of the Purpose: To comply with the regulatory obligations to which ING is bound. As a banking institution, we must comply with applicable regulations, such as the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism or tax fraud, among others. We are also required to consult available fraud alert registries and systems, as well as national and international sanctions lists, when you contract with us; or to verify your identity, which we can do based on verifications carried out by other financial institutions through Iberpay, by checking your ID or identification document with the Tax Agency, or by other methods to verify your identity remotely, such as, for example, a video selfie.

Legal basis: We will process your data to comply with current regulations.
Data categories: Identification data, transaction data, financial data, sociodemographic data, location data, sensitive data (conviction data and infractions). Additionally, data related to our knowledge of our customers (KYC) as part of our due diligence. For identification processing via selfies and video selfies, biometric data is not processed.

Profiling: We evaluate certain personal aspects for this purpose.

Categories of recipients (Assignees) The data will be communicated to the
General Council of the Judiciary, State Security Forces and Bodies, Bank of Spain, National Securities Market Commission, Tax Agency and General Treasury of Social Security, among other public bodies.

Line 4 of the table where they are collected:

Description of the Purpose: To carry out a solvency assessment when you apply for risky products. This allows us to ensure that the credit product you apply for (for example, when applying for credit cards, personal loans, or mortgages) is appropriate according to the requirements set by ING and that you have the necessary payment capacity to meet it.

Legal Basis: We will process your data to comply with current regulations, which require assessing the solvency of applicants, such as Law 16/2011, on June 24, on Consumer Credit Contracts, or other equivalent regulations regarding the granting of mortgage loans and, in general, regarding the responsibility for granting loans. In addition, we will process your data

based on our legitimate interest in preventing the risk of insolvency and fraud, while ensuring the financial stability
of the entity, avoiding economic losses, and complying with our
internal regulations. If you are not an ING customer and you apply for a
personal loan, we will ask for your consent to perform the necessary checks on your information at other banking institutions that you

authorize.

Data categories: Identification, transactional, and financial data
(creditworthiness).

We consult public or private creditworthiness files (ASNEF file of

ASNEF Equifax, Servicios de Información sobre Solvencia y Crédito, S.L., and Badex file of Experian Bureau de Crédito, S.A.) to which we are currently affiliated. We also consult the file of the Central de Información de Riesgos (CIRBE) of the Bank of Spain.

Finally, we consult the file of the Social Security Treasury to

verify the employment information you provide.

Profiling: We create profiles, create models, and
perform assessment or scoring procedures to obtain an indicative score
of the probability that you can meet your payment obligations.

Categories of Recipients (Assignees) No. (emphasis added)

TENTH:

The privacy policy, which can currently be consulted on the website and was updated on May 31, 2024, informs its clients or potential clients that, in order to comply with their legal obligation regarding the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism or tax fraud, among others, they may verify with the General Treasury of Social Security or use other means such as requesting additional documentation from the interested party or their employer. They inform that the legal basis is compliance with a legal obligation and, subsidiarily, the legal basis is legitimate interest.

3. To comply with regulations

Purpose Description: To comply with regulatory obligations, such as those related to:

- The prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism or tax fraud, among others. For example, we will request information to verify the origin of the funds in your accounts or to verify with the General Treasury of Social Security your employment, professional, or business activity that you have indicated to us. In this case, we will not request additional information about your employment history; we will only verify the information you have provided to us during the hiring process. We may use other means to fulfill this purpose, such as requesting additional documentation from you or requesting it from your employer.
- The preparation of regulatory reports to which we are required by law, such as, for example, tax reports imposed by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Law. Currently, the regulations are slow to establish a common reporting standard regarding the obligation to automatically exchange information.
- The evaluation of your knowledge and experience in the financial markets, financial situation, and investment objectives in accordance with MiFID regulations, which also include the recording of any telephone conversations we have with you related to an investment services transaction.

- Other obligations imposed by commercial, tax, corporate, and any other regulations that may be imposed by competent authorities such as the Bank of Spain, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Spain, the National Commission on Markets and Competition, and the National Securities Market Commission, among others.

Legal basis: Compliance with legal obligations. Likewise, for the verification of employment data with the General Treasury of Social Security, we rely, as a subsidiary legal basis, on the legitimate interest of preventing fraud in providing the required documentation.

Data categories: Identification, transactional, financial, sociodemographic, location, and sensitive data (data on convictions and offenses).

Know-your-customer (KYC) data as part of our due diligence.
Data verified with the General Treasury of Social Security or the employer to verify your professional or business activity.
For identification processing via video selfies, biometric data is not processed.

Profiling: With profiling. Profiling in this processing activity is related to compliance with obligations to prevent fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing.

Categories of recipients (Assignees): General Council of Power,
State Security Forces and Bodies, Bank of Spain (CIRBE, SEPBLAC), National Securities Market Commission, Tax Agency,
among other public bodies.

4. To assess your financial solvency and credit risk.

Description of the purpose: To assess your creditworthiness when you apply for risk products.
This allows us to ensure that you meet the requirements set by ING and that you have the necessary payment capacity to contract the credit product you are applying for.
We will continuously monitor the credit risk of our clients with risk products to detect situations that warn of a deterioration in their creditworthiness early on and to be able to adopt mitigating measures.

Legal basis: Execution of the contract or pre-contractual measures and compliance with legal obligations, such as Law 16/2011, of June 24, on Consumer Credit Contracts, among others, as well as the legitimate interest of complying with the guidelines on the granting and monitoring of loans issued by the European banking authority, which recommends continuous monitoring of our clients' risk.

Data categories: Identification, transactional, and financial (creditworthiness).

When you apply to purchase a risk product, we consult public or private creditworthiness files to which we are registered at any given time (ASNEF File of Asnef-Equifax, Servicios de Información sobre Solvencia y Crédito, S.L., and Badex File of Experian Bureau de Crédito, S.A.). In addition, we consult the file of the Bank of Spain's risk information center (CIRBE).

Profiling: With profiling. Profiling in this processing activity is related to the assessment of your payment capacity, solvency, and credit risk.

Categories of recipients (Transferees) There is no data transfer.” (emphasis added)

LEGAL BASIS

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 22/49

I. Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of the GDPR and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD,
the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, this Organic Law, and the regulatory provisions issued in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II Violation of Article 6.1 of the GDPR

According to Article 6 of the GDPR, "Lawfulness of processing:

1. Processing shall only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:

a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;

b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;

c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the data controller;

d) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;

e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;

f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued

by the controller or by a third party, provided that such interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.

In this case, ING asserts that the verification of the complainant's personal data (who has contracted with ING by completing the contracting process and, therefore, "authorizing" ING to verify her personal data before the TGSS), as well as the personal data of the rest of its clients before the TGSS, obtained in compliance with the obligations imposed by the LPBCFT (General Tax Law), is a consequence of the legal obligation imposed by the LPBCFT (C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 23/49), which includes in its Article 2 the subjects obliged in the Prevention of Money Laundering: Financial Institutions (banks, savings banks, credit cooperatives, etc.), Insurance Companies, Credit Institutions, etc. Legal obligation
which is the legal basis that, according to ING, supports the authorization included in the contracting process to verify certain client data with the TGSS.

In this regard, regarding the legal obligation imposed on financial institutions (not on clients), this same law regulates in Article 5 that,

"Obligated entities shall collect information from their clients in order to understand the

nature of their professional or business activity and shall adopt measures aimed at reasonably verifying the veracity of said information.

Such measures shall consist of establishing and implementing procedures for verifying the activities declared by clients. These procedures shall take into account the different levels of risk and shall be based on obtaining documents from clients related to the declared activity or on obtaining information about it from outside the client." (emphasis added)

Article 6 adds that,

"Obligated entities shall apply continuous monitoring measures to the business relationship, including scrutiny of transactions carried out throughout said relationship to ensure that they match the obliged entity's knowledge of the client and their business and risk profile, including the source of funds, and to ensure that the documents, data, and information available are up-to-date."

Royal Decree 304/2014, of May 5, approving the Regulations of Law 10/2010, of April 28, on the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, which implements the LPBCFT, establishes:

Article 10. Purpose and nature of the business relationship.

1. Obliged entities shall collect information from their clients in order to understand

the nature of their professional or business activity. The activity declared by the client shall be registered by the obliged entity prior to the commencement of the business relationship.

2. Obligated entities will verify the activities declared by clients in the following cases:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 24/49

a) When the client or the business relationship presents higher-than-average risks, due to a regulatory provision or because this is evident from the obliged entity's risk analysis.

b) When monitoring of the business relationship shows that the client's active or passive transactions do not correspond to their declared activity or operating history.

3. Verification actions regarding the declared professional or business activity will be graded according to risk and will be carried out using documentation provided by the client or by obtaining information from reliable independent sources. Likewise, obliged entities may verify clients' professional or business activity through in-person visits to the offices, warehouses, or premises declared by the client as places where they carry out their commercial activity, leaving a written record of the results of said visit.

(…)

Article 11. Continuous monitoring of the business relationship.

1. Obliged entities shall scrutinize the transactions carried out throughout the business relationship to ensure that they are consistent with the client's professional or business activity and operational history. Obliged entities shall increase monitoring when they detect higher-than-average risks due to a regulatory provision or because this is evident from the obliged entity's risk analysis.

(…)

2. Obliged entities shall periodically conduct review processes to ensure that the documents, data, and information obtained as a result of the application of due diligence measures are kept up-to-date and current.

(…)” (emphasis added)

In accordance with the aforementioned regulations, the banking institution's processing consists of, on the one hand, collecting information from clients under the terms
explicit in the LPBCFT (Spanish Tax Law on the Protection of Personal Data) and, on the other, adopting measures aimed at reasonably verifying the veracity of said information.

Thus, it is true that the sectoral regulations establish the obligation to verify the professional and business activities of the subjects with whom business will be done. However, they do not stipulate that this must be done in a specific manner. It is the personal data controller (in this case, ING) who must decide on this verification procedure, which must comply with personal data protection regulations.

The agreement signed with the TGSS (General Tax Authority) on the transfer of information, to which ING has adhered, in order to facilitate credit institutions' compliance with the regulations of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 25/49

The prevention of money laundering, through a mechanized computerized procedure that allows for the establishment of a daily process for data requests by financial institutions and the transmission of information by the TGSS, could be an appropriate mechanism for compliance with their obligations, but not necessarily the only one. Thus, as indicated in the previously cited provisions, obligated entities may carry out verification actions through documentation provided by the client, or by obtaining information from reliable independent sources. In fact, as provided in proven fact X, this possibility for the client to provide documentation for this purpose is expressly provided for in the entity's current privacy policy, but not in the previous one in force at the time the claim was filed. Thus, ING has decided to verify this information through the system established in the
Agreement between the General Treasury of Social Security, the Spanish Banking Association, the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives on the transfer of information, to which ING has adhered, and is obliged to comply with the provisions of the aforementioned Agreement.

The agreement states in its sixth clause and Annex III that for the TGSS (General Social Security Administration) to allow ING to verify certain data about its customers, the interested party must consent to the bank verifying personal data with the TGSS. This effectively includes the clause that allows express consent to verify the information.

The agreement specifies that "...each Collaborating Financial Institution is obliged to
guarantee, with respect to each request it makes: b) that prior to the request for information by the Collaborating Financial Institution, it has the

corresponding express authorization, signed by the interested party, and agreed upon by the
parties. (See Annex III)".

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 26/49

Therefore, as ING suggests, adherence to the agreement is not sufficient for client data to be verified with the TGSS; rather, it is an essential requirement to obtain the client's prior express and signed consent.

However, while this is the way in which the agreement establishes that consent must be requested for the purpose of allowing verification in the TGSS systems,

this is not the only way to verify personal data, in the aforementioned terms of the LPCBCFT and its implementing regulations.

The regulations do not establish an obligation to verify personal data information before the TGSS; rather, the information is provided by the client and subsequently, taking into account the different risk levels, there is a general obligation to establish and
apply verification procedures for the activities declared by clients.

Therefore, in order to consult personal data with the TGSS, given that the Law does not impose this option on banking entities nor impose this legal obligation on the interested party/customer, the legal burden of having the banking entity verify the personal data provided by the claimant with the TGSS without their consent would require obtaining the interested party's consent, not requiring the use of this mechanism, and always subject to the specific circumstances in which the law requires such verification. In this sense, Article 4.11 of the GDPR establishes that “consent of the data subject” is “any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, whether by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, agrees to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.”

Consent is understood as a clear affirmative act reflecting a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous expression of the data subject's wishes to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, provided with sufficient safeguards to demonstrate that the data subject is aware of the fact that he or she is giving his or her consent and of the extent to which he or she is doing so.

It must also be given for all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes, so that, when processing has several purposes, consent must be given specifically and unambiguously for all of them. In this regard, the lawfulness of processing requires that the data subject be informed of the purposes for which the data is intended (informed consent).

Furthermore, consent must be freely given. Consent is deemed to be unfree when the data subject does not have genuine or free choice or cannot refuse or withdraw consent without suffering any harm, or when the performance of a contract or provision of services is dependent on consent, even when consent is not necessary for such performance. This occurs when consent is included as a non-negotiable part of the general conditions. This has been demonstrated in the fourth proven fact, since it is impossible to continue with the contracting process for the aforementioned current accounts, as it is included as a non-negotiable part of said contract. Thus, the clause included in the contracting process states,

“Furthermore, I confirm that I have been informed by ING BANK NV, Branch in Spain, that current legislation on the prevention of money laundering requires banking institutions to obtain information on their clients' economic activity and to conduct a verification of it.

For the sole purpose of verifying the information provided, I give my express consent to ING BANK NV, Branch in Spain, so that it may request such information from the General Treasury of Social Security on my behalf.
The data obtained from the General Treasury of Social Security will be used exclusively for the purposes indicated above.
In the event of non-compliance with this obligation by the Financial Institution and/or its personnel, all actions provided for in Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights will be taken.” (emphasis added)

According to the screenshot provided after the cited clause, there is an option to "return" or "continue," without a specific checkbox to expressly provide or decline the required consent.

To continue with the banking product contracting process, there is no other option

than to click the "continue" box and, by doing so, consent, without fail, to ING's verification of certain customer data with the TGSS.

Furthermore, this clause does not mention any alternative mechanism for verifying the information without having to provide the required express consent.

Without these conditions, as is the case in the case examined, the consent given by the data subject would not determine control over their personal data and its use. ING's verification of certain personal data of its customers with the TGSS would be taking place without valid consent, without a legal basis legitimizing the processing of personal data, and therefore in violation of the GDPR.

On the other hand, the European Data Protection Board, in its document "Guidelines 05/2020 on consent pursuant to Regulation 2016/679," which updates the guidelines on consent adopted by the Article 29 Working Party on November 28, 2017, revised and approved on April 10, 2018, refers to this and indicates that:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 28/49

"3. In general, consent can only be an adequate legal basis if the data subject is given control and a real choice regarding whether to accept or reject the conditions offered, or to reject them without suffering any harm. When requesting consent, the data controller has an obligation to assess whether such consent will meet all the requirements for obtaining valid consent. If obtained in full compliance with the GDPR, consent is a tool that gives data subjects control over whether or not their personal data will be processed. If not, the data subject's control will be merely illusory, and consent will not be a valid legal basis for processing, rendering such processing unlawful. (emphasis added)

These guidelines go on to state:

"13. The term 'free' implies real choice and control on the part of data subjects. As a general rule, the GDPR establishes that if the data subject is not genuinely free to choose, feels compelled to give consent, or will suffer negative consequences if not, then consent cannot be considered valid. If consent is included as a non-negotiable part of the terms and conditions, it is assumed that it was not freely given. Consequently, consent will not be considered freely given if the data subject cannot withhold or withdraw consent without prejudice." (emphasis added)

In the present case, consent cannot be considered free because upon signing the contract, all customers are required to have their personal data verified by consulting the TGSS. This is evident in the proven facts, as we have stated, since in order to continue with the contracting process for the referenced current accounts, the customer is forced to consent, regardless, without any freedom to refuse (since the only possible checkboxes are "return" or "continue," the latter implying consent).

This occurs because ING has linked the contract for the aforementioned current accounts to the provision of consent for the customer to authorize it to verify their data with the TGSS.

This absolutely and totally limits the ability of such individuals to choose whether they want ING to carry out such verification of personal data by consulting the TGSS, since it is not mandatory, as explained above. The legal obligation to verify certain customer data rests with financial institutions and not with the clients.

However, contrary to the arguments made by the institution in its allegations regarding the initiation agreement, and as substantiated, the legal basis that legitimizes the verification of certain customer data before the TGSS is not compliance with a legal obligation (which is not a legal obligation for the client), but rather the prior, express, and signed consent of the data subject.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 29/49

The consent of the data subject is required, under the terms of the GDPR, for a financial institution to verify certain customer data with the TGSS.

This is clearly and expressly stated in the Agreement between the General Treasury of Social Security, the Spanish Banking Association, the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks, and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives on the transfer of information, to which ING is a party and which we have reviewed.

Both Clause Six and Annex III of the aforementioned agreement make reference, interchangeably and in the same sense, to the requirement of express authorization or express consent from a client for the TGSS to allow participating entities to verify certain personal data about their clients.

It should be noted that the term "authorize" is synonymous, according to the RAE dictionary, with "consent."

Furthermore, the agreement itself places the Spanish Data Protection Agency in a prominent position regarding the control of such consents, as it stipulates in its fourth clause that "authorizations signed by the data subject must be kept by the Collaborating Financial Institutions and delivered to the TGSS or the Data Protection Agency, upon request, within ten days of their request."

Contrary to ING's argument, this "authorization," this consent, is the consent of the GDPR, and the agreement itself requires collaborating financial institutions, such as ING, to provide consents to the AEPD when requested; this is in accordance with the powers granted to the AEPD to fulfill its duties of monitoring the application of the GDPR and enforcing it under the terms set forth in Article 57 of the GDPR, as could not be otherwise.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the content of the agreement could not be other than requiring the prior, express, and signed consent of the interested party, in accordance with the provisions of the rest of the regulations.

Thus, art. Article 77 of Royal Legislative Decree 8/2015, of October 30, which approves the revised text of the General Social Security Law, establishes that the data obtained by the Social Security Administration in the exercise of its functions are confidential, making it impossible to transfer or communicate them to third parties:

"The data, reports, or background information obtained by the Social Security Administration in the exercise of its functions is confidential and may only be used for the purposes entrusted to the various managing entities, common services, and bodies that comprise the Social Security Administration, and may not be transferred or communicated to third parties, unless the transfer or communication is intended to: (...)"

Thus, the provision lists a set of specific cases in which The transfer or communication of data to third parties is permitted, except for the case examined in this sanctioning procedure.

In this regard, the SAN of September 15, 2023, rec. 1443/2020 confirms the confidential nature of the data processed by the TGSS regarding a natural person and that "it only permits the processing of the aforementioned personal data when either there is consent from the data subject or another lawful or legitimate reason for such processing, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the GDPR and Articles 4 to 8 of the LOPDGDD."

To this, we must add the provisions of the tenth additional provision of the LOPDGDD, which, regarding the communication of data by the subjects listed in Article 77.1 of the LOPDGDD (which includes the TGSS), states that,

"The data controllers listed in Article 77.1 of this Organic Law may communicate the personal data requested by subjects of private law when they have the consent of the data subjects or when they determine that the applicants have a legitimate interest that prevails over the data subject's interest." the rights and interests of those affected in accordance with the provisions of

Article 6.1 f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679." (emphasis added)

Furthermore, in the new wording of its current privacy policy, in which
ING refers and has added after the initiation of this sanctioning procedure,
in addition to compliance with legal obligations as the applicable legal basis for

processing, with regard to the verification of employment data with the General Treasury of Social Security, the subsidiary legal basis would be the legitimate interest of
preventing fraud in the provision of the required documentation.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 31/49

The June 2014 opinion of the Article 29 Working Party establishes the three requirements that must be met for legitimate interest to apply: the interest must be lawful,

clearly delimited and defined, and finally, it must not be speculative. Consequently, a balancing exercise must be carried out to determine whether or not legitimate interest applies. This legitimate interest would allow processing without obtaining consent to satisfy a legitimate need of the data controller, provided that it is verified that satisfying this legitimate interest does not significantly affect the rights and freedoms of the data subject. In this case, the fundamental right of customers to the right to access their data would be affected.

Likewise, the CJEU of 4 October 2024, in Case C-621/22, recalls that,

“(37) …Article 6(1), first subparagraph, point (f) of the GDPR establishes
three cumulative conditions for the processing of personal data
to be lawful, namely, first, that the controller or the

third party pursues a legitimate interest; second, that the processing of
the personal data is necessary for the pursuit of that legitimate interest;
and, third, that the legitimate interest of the controller or a third party is not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject with regard to data protection \[judgment of 4

July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others (General terms and conditions of service of a social network), C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 106 and case-law \[cited\]"

41 Furthermore, it should be recalled that, pursuant to Article 13(1)(d) of the GDPR, the controller is responsible, at the time when personal data relating to a data subject are obtained,

to inform that data subject of the legitimate interests pursued where such processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), first subparagraph, of that Regulation \[judgment of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others (General terms and conditions of a social network service), C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 107\].

42 As regards, secondly, the requirement relating to the necessity
of the processing of personal data for the satisfaction of the legitimate interest pursued, it requires the referring court to verify that the
legitimate interest pursued by the processing of the data cannot reasonably be achieved as effectively by other means that are less detrimental to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter \[judgment of 7 December 2023, SCHUFA Holding (Discharge from unsatisfied liabilities), C-26/22 and C-64/22, EU:C:2023:958, paragraph 77 and the case-law cited\].

44 Finally, with regard, thirdly, to the requirement that the data subject's interests or fundamental rights and freedoms regarding data protection do not prevail over the legitimate interest of the controller or a third party, the Court has already held that this requirement entails a balancing of the conflicting rights and interests, which will, in principle, depend on the specific circumstances of the particular case and that, consequently, it is for the referring court to carry out that balancing taking into account those specific circumstances \[judgment of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others (General terms and conditions of a social networking service), C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 110 and the case-law cited\].

45 Furthermore, as is clear from Recital 47 of the GDPR, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject may, in particular, prevail over the interests of the controller when personal data are processed in circumstances where the data subject does not reasonably expect such processing to take place \[judgment of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others (General Terms and Conditions of a Social Network Service), C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 112\]. (emphasis added)

And as stated in Guidelines 5/2020 on consent within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:

“123. The controller may not shift from consent to other legal bases. For example, it is not permitted to retrospectively use the basis of legitimate interest to justify processing where it encounters problems with the validity of consent.”

Therefore, based on the evidence currently available in the proposed resolution of the sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the known facts constitute a violation of the procedure established for verifying certain client data before the TGSS, attributable to the respondent, due to a violation of Article 6.1 of the GDPR.

III Response to the allegations regarding the initiation agreement

In response to the allegations presented by the respondent entity, the following should be noted:

Regarding data processing

The respondent states that once the client or potential client has provided their personal identifying data, they are required, as stated in Proven Fact I, to provide a series of basic financial data related to their professional performance. Specifically, they must provide their employment status, professional activity, sector of employment, company, monthly income, purpose of the main relationship, and, finally, the source of their funds.

Of all the data obtained directly from the data subject, the only ones that are subject to subsequent verification are the "employment status" and "payer" data, the latter only if appropriate. ING does not verify or consult the client's employment history or any additional data that the TGSS may have.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 33/49

ING refers here to the fact that the personal data obtained are identifying and economic data that do not constitute sensitive or specially protected data, within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR.

However, although the economic data referred to by the investigated entity are not sensitive, this does not mean that they do not have any significance, at an individual or social level, in people's lives, nor that their knowledge without legitimization by a third party cannot be intrusive or detrimental to their rights and freedoms. This is further demonstrated by the confidential nature of the data obtained by the Social Security Administration in the performance of its functions, making it impossible to transfer or communicate it to third parties, with some exceptions.

The First Clause of the Agreement establishes the transfer of information from the TGSS databases to the member entities of AEB/CECA/UNACC for the sole purpose of verifying the veracity of the information that financial institutions collect from their clients, in order to understand the nature of their professional or business activity and that clients provide when establishing business relationships.

Furthermore, the subject of the debate is not whether the data ING processes is sensitive or whether it verifies the client's employment history or any additional data with the TGSS, but rather the fact that the prior and mandatory consent of the interested party is required.

The Agreement itself, in its Fourth Clause, "Obligations of the AEB, CECA, and UNACC
with respect to their associated Financial Institutions," establishes in its
section b):

"Inform them that the use of the data obtained is exclusively

for the purposes set forth in this Agreement."

And in its section c):

"Inform them that the requests they make to the TGSS, which in all cases
will always require the signed authorization of the interested party, will refer,

exclusively, to individuals who initiate business relationships with the
Collaborating Financial Institution or to individuals regarding whom,
after a reasonable period of time, it becomes necessary to update their information.
The authorizations signed by the interested party must be kept by the
Collaborating Financial Institutions and delivered to the TGSS or the Data Protection Agency, when requested, within ten days of their request." (emphasis added)

Furthermore, the sixth clause of the Agreement states that "each Collaborating Financial Institution undertakes to guarantee, with respect to each request it makes:

"a) That the requests refer to individuals who initiate business relationships with the Financial Institution or to individuals for whom, after a reasonable period of time, it becomes necessary to update their information.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 34/49

b) That prior to the request for information by the Collaborating Financial Entity, it has the corresponding express authorization, signed by the interested party, and agreed upon by the parties. (See Annex III)". (emphasis added)

(.../…)
That is, the Agreement, to which INGG has adhered, makes it clear to the AEB, to which ING belongs, that it must inform its Financial Institutions that any requests they make to the TGSS will always require the signed authorization of the interested party. Furthermore, each financial institution requires the corresponding signed authorization from the interested party prior to requesting information from the TGSS. It also refers, by indicating "see Annex III," to the need for such consent and how.

Without the clients' signed authorization, the TGSS should not proceed with the requested verification.

The TGSS itself makes this clear to citizens on its website (https://revista.seg-social.es/-/la-seguridad-social-respeta-tus-datos), stating that “The

European Data Protection Regulation unifies and modernizes European data protection regulations, and allows citizens better control over their personal data. Among other things, citizens must give their express consent for the handling of this data and, of course, for its transfer to third parties."

Regarding the need to verify the data and information provided by clients to the TGSS:

ING states that the obligation entrusted to banking institutions to verify the information provided by clients or potential clients in relation to their work activities is materialized with the signing of the agreement that allows them to verify the veracity of the information collected, based on the transfer of information from the TGSS databases.

In this sense, the agreement itself establishes that the obligated entities will adopt measures aimed at reasonably verifying the veracity of the professional or business information provided by clients, but taking into account the different levels of risk. These measures will be based on obtaining documents from clients related to the declared activity or obtaining information about it that is not related to the client.

Given that Royal Decree 304/2014, of May 5, which approves the Regulations of Law 10/2010, of April 28, establishes that,

"obligated parties shall verify the activities declared by clients in the following cases:

a) When the client or the business relationship presents higher-than-average risks, either by regulatory provision or because this is evident from the obliged party's risk analysis.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 35/49

b) When monitoring of the business relationship shows that the client's active or passive transactions do not correspond to their declared activity or operating history."

Therefore, there is no obligation to verify the activities declared by clients on all occasions, but rather it must be done based on the potential risk level. In the present case, the complainant proceeded to open a Non-Account Account. Based on the Non-Account Account section of the ING website, see "Risk Indicator for Non-Account Accounts and Orange Accounts":

1/6: This number indicates the risk of the product, with 1/6 indicating lower risk and 6/6 indicating higher risk.

On the legality of data processing carried out by ING

According to ING, contrary to what is indicated by the AEPD, the Agreement between the General Treasury of Social Security does not stipulate the need for financial institution clients to provide consent within the meaning of Article 6.1 a) of the GDPR, in order to carry out the aforementioned verification. Instead, it refers to mere authorization and equates this consent to that of Article 1262 of the Civil Code, which establishes the provision of consent required to formalize a contract: "Consent is expressed by the concurrence of the offer and the acceptance of the thing and the cause that constitute the contract. If the person making the offer and the person accepting it are in different places, consent exists from the moment the offeror is aware of the acceptance or, having received it, the acceptor cannot ignore it without violating good faith. In such a case, the contract is presumed to have been concluded in the place where the offer was made." In contracts concluded through automated devices, consent exists from the moment acceptance is expressed."

According to the analysis carried out by ING, consent does not constitute adequate legitimacy for data processing consisting of the verification of the financial data provided by customers to the extent required by the AML Regulation.

Therefore, in addition to referring to what was stated in the previous legal basis,

it should be noted at this point that Article 6.1, section c) of the GDPR establishes that,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 36/49

"6.1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following

conditions is met: (...) c) processing is necessary for compliance with a
legal obligation applicable to the data controller."

This must be completed with the provisions of Article 8 of the LOPDGDD,

"1. The processing of personal data may only be considered based on

compliance with a legal obligation enforceable by the data controller, under the terms
provided for in Article 6.1.c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, when so provided by a rule of European Union law or a rule with the rank of law, which may determine the general conditions of processing and the types
of data subject to it, as well as the transfers that proceed as a result of
compliance with the legal obligation. This regulation may also impose special conditions on the processing, such as the adoption of additional security measures or others established in Chapter IV of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

However, this is not the legal basis, as indicated above, that legitimizes ING to carry out the data processing consisting of verifying the data of its clients before the TGSS, since neither the LPBCFT nor Royal Legislative Decree 8/2015, of October 30, which approves the revised text of the General Social Security Law, at any time expressly impose on the data subject, the client of the banking institution, the legal burden of supporting and allowing the transfer of personal data being processed by the TGSS, nor does it require the TGSS to transfer such data to financial institutions.

However, and despite the fact that ING bases its processing on art. 6.1 c) and maintains that the Agreement between the General Treasury of the Social Security Administration and the Financial Institutions does not stipulate the need for financial institutions' clients to provide consent, within the meaning of Article 6.1 a) of the GDPR, in order to carry out the aforementioned verification. The Agreement itself establishes that its purpose is to facilitate credit institutions' compliance with anti-money laundering regulations by verifying the veracity of the information that financial institutions collect from their clients in order to understand the nature of their professional or business activity and that clients provide when establishing business relationships. And among the obligations established in this agreement in its fourth clause, "Obligations of the AEB, CECA, and UNACC," are:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 37/49

"c) Inform them that the requests they make to the TGSS, which in all cases
will always require the signed authorization of the interested party, will refer,

exclusively, to individuals who initiate business relationships with the Collaborating Financial Institution or to individuals regarding whom,
after a reasonable period of time, it becomes necessary to update their information."
(emphasis added)

It should be noted that financial institutions interested in

adhering to the Agreement assume the rights and obligations set forth therein, as well as
being affected by the liability that comes with adhering to it.

Thus, in its sixth clause, referring to the responsibility for the operation of the verification system regarding the nature of the professional or business activity arising from its affiliation with Social Security, it establishes:

“b) That prior to the request for information by the Collaborating Financial Entity, it has the corresponding express authorization, signed by the interested party, and agreed upon by the parties. (See Annex III).”(emphasis added)

Remember that the content of Annex III leaves no room for doubt that the TGSS,
for the purpose specified in the agreement, requires prior, express, and signed consent for the financial institution, in this case ING, to request such information on behalf of the interested party.

ANNEX III

D. ................................................................with......................,
D.N.I........................ and
address...................................................................................................................

The financial institution.......................................,

The data obtained from the General Treasury of Social Security will be used exclusively for the purposes indicated above. In the event of non-compliance with this obligation by the financial institution and/or the personnel providing services there, all actions provided for in Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights will be taken.

In ...................... on ........ of ............................ of ...............

Signature of the authorizing party

Ultimately, the required authorization corresponds to the consent that the interested party gives to the processing of the information that, on their behalf, the financial institution requests from the General Treasury of Social Security and that will be used exclusively for that purpose. This consent is understood in the terms of the GDPR.

In such a way that in the event of non-compliance with the management, all the actions provided for in the GDPR and the LOPDGDD will be executed.
Without the express consent of the interested party, whose authorization refers to the authorization for verification of the data provided before the TGSS, the TGSS should not allow the banking institution to verify the client's data.

Then, the basis that legitimizes the processing is the consent set forth in Article 6.1 a) of the GDPR:

"a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;"

Furthermore, the complainant's complaint included an excerpt of the clause for which ING requested confirmation in order to continue with the account opening process. ING acknowledges that this clause is included in the opening processes for its "payroll account" and "No account" products. For all its clients, it stipulates that,

"I confirm that I have been informed by ING BANK N.V., Branch in Spain, that current legislation on the prevention of money laundering requires banking entities to obtain information on their clients' economic activity and to conduct a verification of it. For the sole purpose of verifying the information provided, I give my express consent to ING BANK N.V., Branch in Spain, to request such information on my behalf from the General Treasury of Social Security. The data obtained from the General Treasury of Social Security will be used exclusively for the purposes indicated above. In the event of
noncompliance with this obligation by the financial institution and/or its personnel, all actions provided for in Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights will be taken. (emphasis added)

This clause makes it abundantly clear that express consent is requested in order to request information from the TGSS, which only reinforces the data subject's consent as a legal basis for processing.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 39/49

Regarding the absence of harm to data subjects

The complainant states in his complaint that he considers his fundamental rights violated by having to provide consent for ING to request information on his behalf from the TGSS.

The respondent asserts that ING's data query to the TGSS (General Tax Authority) is merely a check to verify the accuracy and veracity of the information provided by clients, with the aim of complying with the AML Regulations. Therefore, in no case would it entail an additional query of information or cause any harm to the data subjects, and is also in compliance with data protection regulations.

In accordance with various jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court, the power to dispose of and control personal data concerning a natural person is an inseparable part of the fundamental right to data protection. The mere unlawful limitation of this power of disposal and control constitutes an infringement of the fundamental right.

On the one hand, Constitutional Court Ruling 292/2000, of November 30, 2000, provides that,

“From all of the above, it follows that the content of the fundamental right to data protection consists of a power of disposition and control over personal data, which empowers the individual to decide which of those data to provide to a third party, whether the State or an individual, or which data this third party may collect, and which also allows the individual to know who possesses that personal data and for what purpose, and to be able to object to such possession or use. These powers of disposition and control over personal data, which constitute part of the content of the fundamental right to data protection, are legally expressed in the right to consent to the collection, obtaining, and access to personal data, its subsequent storage and processing, as well as its use or possible uses, by a third party, whether the State or an individual.

And this right to consent to the knowledge and processing, whether electronic or not, of personal data, requires, as essential complements, on the one hand, the ability to know at all times who has that personal data and to what use they are being put, and, on the other hand, the power to oppose that possession and use." (emphasis added)

Likewise, Constitutional Court Ruling 254/1993, of July 20, 1993, provides that,

"the right to data protection grants its data subject a set of powers

consisting of various legal powers, the exercise of which imposes legal duties on third parties, which are not contained in the fundamental right to privacy, and which serve the main function of this fundamental right: to guarantee the individual the power to control their personal data, which is only possible and effective by imposing the aforementioned duties on third parties." Namely: the right to request prior consent for the collection and use of personal data, the right to know and be informed about the destination and use of said data, and the right to access, rectify, and delete said data. In short, the power of disposition over personal data." (emphasis added).

The harm to data subjects, the infringement of the legal right, occurs due to a failure to respect the data subject's power of disposition and control over the personal data that concerns them. When consent is required for personal data processing to be carried out and this possibility is denied, as in the case under consideration, their will is being overridden and the fundamental right violated.

Furthermore, it should be remembered that the damages caused by the violation of the fundamental right include not only material damages but also immaterial damages (recognized not only in recital 75 of the GDPR but also by the AN itself in its rulings).

Regarding the lack of proportionality of the proposed sanction

According to the respondent, the sanction included in the Initiation Agreement is, in any case, disproportionate, given the alleged violation, nor does it agree with the circumstances classified as aggravating factors.

Regarding the nature, severity, and duration of the violation, ING maintains that there is only one interested party involved, who is, moreover, the person who filed the complaint. However, the facts revealed affect all clients and potential clients who contract either the "payroll account" or the "No account" account, as has been proven, since, as ING has acknowledged, this is a contracting system for all its clients that includes the aforementioned clause.

Regarding the intentionality or negligence in the violation, according to the respondent, there is no aggravating factor of intentionality in the conduct since it is determined by compliance with its obligations regarding fraud prevention and money laundering. Here, however, what is required is consent in an adhesion clause without real possibility of consent, being fully aware of the requirements of the agreement signed with the TGSS.

IV. Classification of the Infringement

The infringement attributed to ING is classified under Article 83.5 a) of the GDPR, which considers that the violation of "the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9" is punishable, in accordance with Section 5 of the aforementioned Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, "with administrative fines of up to €20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher." C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 41/49

Article 71 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data), on Infractions, states that: "The following constitute infractions:
the acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of

Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law."

And in its Article 72, it considers, for the purposes of prescription, that they are: “Infractions considered very serious:

1. Based on the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

(…)

b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing established in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 being met.

(…).

V Proposed Sanction

In order to establish the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions contained in Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j).

When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:

(a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the

number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;

(b) the intentionality or negligence of the infringement;

a) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects;

b) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 42/49

c) any previous breaches committed by the controller or processor;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent;

(i) where the measures indicated in Article 58(2) have been previously ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with such measures;

(j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42; and

(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case,

such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

In relation to Article 83.2(k) of the GDPR, the LOPDGDD, in Article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures," establishes that:

"2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2(k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
the following may also be taken into account:

(a) The continuing nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.
c) The benefits obtained as a result of committing the infringement.
d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission of the infringement.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.
f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) Having, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.
h) Voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

In accordance with the transcribed provisions, for the purposes of determining the amount of the fine to be imposed in this case for the violation classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR for which the defendant is held responsible, the following circumstances are considered concurrent:

- The nature, severity, and duration of the violation (Article 83.2, a) of the GDPR), taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question; given that the facts revealed affect all clients who contract either the "payroll account" or the "non-account account," as evidenced by the proven facts, since ING's method of requiring consent, in violation of the GDPR, is required of all clients who use the system. of contracting.

- Intentionality or negligence in the infringement (Article 83.2. b) of the GDPR). ING has signed the agreement with the TGSS, an agreement that imposes a series of obligations on the financial institution. Clause six expressly states that "prior to the request for information by the Collaborating Financial Institution, the latter has the corresponding express authorization, signed by the interested party, and agreed upon by the parties." Furthermore, Annex III of the aforementioned agreement states that "for the sole purpose of verifying the information provided, I give my express consent to ................................................ (financial institution) to request such information from the General Treasury of Social Security on my behalf," which must also be signed by the client.

However, they have demanded consent in an adhesion clause without any real possibility of consent, even though they were fully aware of the requirements of the agreement signed with the TGSS.

In this regard, the Supreme Court ruling of October 17, 2007 (rec. 63/2006) is very illustrative. It states that "...the Supreme Court has considered that negligence exists whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in assessing the degree of diligence, the professionalism or lack thereof of the subject must be especially considered, and there is no doubt that, in the case now under examination, when the appellant's activity involves constant and extensive handling of personal data, rigor and exquisite care must be emphasized to comply with the legal provisions in this regard."

The activity of the allegedly infringing entity is linked to the processing of data of both clients and third parties. The processing of its clients' personal data is essential to the entity's activity, so, given its volume, the significance of this activity, the subject of this complaint, is very high (Article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD in relation to Article 83.2.k).

Considering the factors set forth, for the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence available at the current time of the proposed resolution of the procedure, taking into account the circumstances of the case and the criteria established in Article 83.2 of the GDPR with respect to the infringement committed, a penalty of TWO MILLION EUROS (€2,000,000) may be imposed.

VI Adoption of Measures

If the infringement is confirmed, the controller may be ordered to adopt appropriate measures to bring its actions into compliance with the regulations mentioned in this

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 44/49

act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2 d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to ensure that processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period..." The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction consisting of an administrative fine, as provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR.

However, in this case, regardless of the foregoing, in accordance with the evidence currently available in the sanctioning procedure,

the resolution adopted may require the respondent party to adopt the following measures within six months from the date of the final resolution of this procedure:

Appropriately inform and obtain the consent, in accordance with the GDPR, of the entity's clients regarding the verification of personal data before the TGSS (General General Tax Authority)
in accordance with the LPBCFT (General Tax Law).

Please note that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by this body in the sanctioning resolution may be considered an administrative violation under the GDPR, classified as a violation in Articles 83.5 and 83.6 thereof, and such conduct may lead to the opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

Likewise, it is recalled that neither the acknowledgment of the infringement committed nor, where applicable, the voluntary payment of the proposed amounts exempts the applicant from the obligation to adopt the relevant measures to cease the conduct or correct the effects of the infringement committed, nor from the obligation to provide proof of compliance with this obligation to this Spanish Data Protection Agency.

In view of the foregoing, the following is issued:

II
Termination of the Procedure

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 47/49

Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter LPACAP), under the heading "Termination of Sanctioning Procedures," provides the following:

"1. Once a sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender acknowledges responsibility, the procedure may be terminated with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.

2. When the sanction is solely pecuniary in nature, or when a pecuniary sanction and a non-pecuniary sanction may be imposed, but the inadmissibility of the second sanction has been justified, voluntary payment by the alleged responsible party, at any time prior to the resolution, will entail the termination of the procedure, except as to restore the altered situation or to determine compensation for damages caused by the commission of the violation.

3. In both cases, when the sanction is solely monetary, the body competent to resolve the procedure will apply reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the proposed sanction, which may be combined.
These reductions must be specified in the notification of initiation of the procedure, and their effectiveness will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

The percentage reduction provided for in this section may be increased by regulation.

III

Voluntary Payment

With the application of this reduction, the penalty would be set at €1,600,000.00, and its payment would terminate the proceedings, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

Following the aforementioned draft resolution, and before the resolution was issued by this authority, ING, on March 7, 2025, proceeded to make the voluntary payment, availing itself of the 20% reduction and waiving any action or appeal through administrative channels.

It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Procedure Act), as well as the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court in this regard, In this regard, the exercise of voluntary payment by the alleged offender does not exempt the administration from the obligation to resolve and notify all proceedings, regardless of their method of initiation. Similarly, Article 88 of the aforementioned regulation establishes that the resolution that concludes the proceedings will decide all issues raised by the interested parties and any other issues arising from them.

Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
