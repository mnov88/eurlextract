Sanction – cross-border processing

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in April 2025, an investigation at the operator Data Diggers Market Research SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 15 and art. 14 reported to art. 12 paragraph (1) and art. 6 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (RGPD).

As such, the operator was sanctioned with:

a fine in the amount of 24,886 Lei, equivalent to the amount of 5,000 Euros, for violating the provisions of art. 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, reported to art. 12 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

fine in the amount of 9,954.40 Lei, equivalent to 2,000 Euros, for violating the provisions of art. 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in relation to art. 12 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;
fine in the amount of 24,886 Lei, equivalent to 5,000 Euros, for violating the provisions of art. 6 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The investigation was initiated following notifications from two other EU data protection authorities, regarding complaints filed by two individuals from these countries against the operator Data Diggers Market Research SRL.

Given that the operator Data Diggers Market Research SRL. has its main office in Romania, the National Supervisory Authority acted as the lead supervisory authority for the cross-border processing carried out by the controller Data Diggers Market Research SRL, in accordance with the provisions of art. 56 and art. 61 of the GDPR.

During the investigation, it was found that the controller did not provide the petitioners with complete information following the exercise of the right of access to personal data, which constitutes a violation of the provisions of art. 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in relation to art. 12 paragraph (1) of the same regulatory act.

At the same time, the controller did not provide at the time of the first communication with the petitioners the information that it was obliged to communicate to the data subjects, thus violating the provisions of art. 14 paragraphs (1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in relation to art. 12 paragraph (1) of the same regulatory act.

Also, the operator did not prove the fulfillment of one of the conditions regarding the lawfulness of the processing of the personal data of the petitioners, which represents a violation of the provisions of art. 6 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

At the same time, pursuant to art. 58 paragraph (2) letter d) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the National Supervisory Authority applied to the operator the corrective measure of ordering regular training measures for the company's staff regarding the procedure to be followed in order to correctly resolve the requests submitted by the data subjects and regarding compliance with the conditions of lawfulness of data processing, in relation to art. 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
