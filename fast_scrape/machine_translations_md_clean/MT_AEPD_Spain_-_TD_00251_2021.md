                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of article 56 in
in relation to paragraph 1 f) of article 57, both of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the

and those in charge of the treatment to cooperate with the control authority that requests it in
the performance of their duties. In the event that they have designated a
data protection officer, article 39 of the RGPD attributes to him the function of

Similarly, the domestic legal system, in article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD, has
Provided a mechanism prior to the admission for processing of the claims that are
made before the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, which consists of giving

responsible entity to proceed with its analysis, provide a response to this Agency

within a month and certify having provided the claimant with the proper response,
in the event of exercise of the rights regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the
GDPR.

The result of said transfer did not allow for the satisfaction of the claims of the

complaining party. Consequently, dated September 3, 2021, for the purposes
provided for in article 64.2 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to admit the submitted claim for processing. Saying
The agreement of admission for processing determines the opening of the present procedure of
lack of attention to a request to exercise the rights established in the

Articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD, regulated in article 64.1 of the LOPDGDD, according to the
which:

The purging of administrative responsibilities in the framework of
of a sanctioning procedure, whose exceptional nature implies that it is chosen,
whenever possible, due to the prevalence of alternative mechanisms that have
I amparo in the current regulations.

It is the exclusive competence of this Agency to assess whether there are responsibilities
administrative procedures that must be purged in a sanctioning procedure and, in
Consequently, the decision on its opening, there being no obligation to initiate a
procedure before any request made by a third party. Such a decision must
be based on the existence of elements that justify said start of the activity
sanctioning, circumstances that do not concur in the present case, considering that

with this procedure, the guarantees and
Claimant's rights.

THIRD: The rights of people in terms of data protection
Personal data are regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD and 13 to 18 of the

LOPDGDD. The rights of access, rectification, deletion,
opposition, right to limitation of treatment and right to portability.

The formal aspects related to the exercise of these rights are established in the
Articles 12 of the RGPD and 12 of the LOPDGDD.

It also takes into account what is expressed in Considerations 59 and following of the
GDPR.

In accordance with the provisions of these rules, the data controller
must arbitrate formulas and mechanisms to facilitate the interested party the exercise of their

rights, which will be free (without prejudice to the provisions of articles 12.5 and 15.3
of the RGPD), and is obliged to respond to requests made no later than one
month, unless you can show that you are unable to identify the
interested, and to express their reasons in case they were not to attend said

Respond to the request for the exercise of their rights made by the affected party.

The communication addressed to the interested party on the occasion of their request must

specify the "data or processing activities to which the request refers." The
Right will be understood to be granted if the person in charge provides remote access to the data,
the request being considered as attended (although the interested party may request the information

referring to the extremes provided for in article 15 of the RGPD).

The exercise of this right may be considered repetitive on more than one occasion.
during the period of six months, unless there is legitimate cause for it.

other than the one offered that involves a disproportionate cost, which must be
assumed by the affected party.

FOURTH: In accordance with the provisions of article 15 of the RGPD and article 13 of the
LOPDGDD, "the interested party has the right to obtain from the person responsible for the treatment

confirmation of whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed and, as such
case, right of access to personal data ”.

Like the rest of the rights of the interested party, the right of access is a
very personal right. Allows the citizen to obtain information about the treatment
what is being done of your data, the possibility of obtaining a copy of the data

personal concerns that are being processed, as well as
information, in particular, about the purposes of the treatment, the categories of data
personal concerned, the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the

conservation, the possibility of exercising other rights, the right to present a

claim before the supervisory authority, the information available on the origin of
the data (if these have not been obtained directly from the owner), the existence of
automated decisions, including profiling, and information about
transfers of personal data to a third country or to an international organization.
The possibility of obtaining a copy of the personal data being processed does not

negatively affect the rights and freedoms of others, that is, the right to
Access will be granted in a way that does not affect third party data.

The right of access in relation to medical records is specifically regulated in
Article 18 of Law 41/2002, of November 14, basic regulating the
Autonomy of the Patient and Rights and Obligations Regarding Information and

Clinical Documentation (hereinafter LAP), whose literal wording expresses:

"one. The patient has the right of access, with the reservations indicated in section 3
of this article, to the documentation of the medical history and to obtain a copy of the
data contained in it. The health centers will regulate the procedure that

ensure the observance of these rights.
2. The patient's right of access to the medical record can also be exercised by
duly accredited representation.
3. The patient's right of access to the documentation of the medical record does not
can be exercised to the detriment of the right of third parties to confidentiality

of the data contained in it collected in the therapeutic interest of the patient, or in
prejudice to the right of the professionals participating in its preparation, who
They can oppose the right to access the reservation of their subjective annotations.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/7

4.Health centers and individual practitioners will only facilitate the
access to the medical history of deceased patients to people linked to him,
for family or factual reasons, unless the deceased had prohibited it

expressly and thus accredited. In any case the access of a third party to the story
clinic motivated by a risk to your health will be limited to relevant data. I dont know
provide information that affects the privacy of the deceased or the annotations
subjective of the professionals, nor that it harms third parties ”.

In this sense, it is necessary to highlight article 15 of the LPA that collects the content

minimum of medical history:

"one. The medical history will incorporate the information that is considered transcendental for the
accurate and up-to-date knowledge of the patient's health status. All patient or
The user has the right to be recorded, in writing or in the technical support more
adequate, of the information obtained in all their care processes, carried out

by the health service both in the field of primary care and care
specialized.
2. The main purpose of the medical record will be to facilitate health care, leaving
proof of all those data that, under medical criteria, allow the knowledge
truthful and updated of the state of health.

The minimum content of the clinical history will be the following:

direct patient care, it will be the responsibility of the professionals who
intervene in it.

4. The clinical history will be kept with unit and integration criteria, in each
care institution as a minimum, to facilitate the best and most timely
knowledge by the physicians of the data of a certain patient in each
care process ”.

Regarding the preservation of the clinical history, article 17 of the LPA, in its
points 1 and 5, provides that:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/7

"one. Health centers are obliged to keep clinical documentation
in conditions that guarantee its correct maintenance and safety, although not
necessarily in the original support, for the proper assistance to the patient during the

time appropriate to each case and, at least, five years from the date
of discharge from each healthcare process ...
5. Health professionals who carry out their activity individually are
responsible for the management and custody of the healthcare documentation
generate ”.

FIFTH: In the case analyzed here, the complaining party exercised its right to
access to the medical history and after analyzing the documentation submitted by
both parties, we conclude that it is not credited to have attended the right.
There is a disagreement between the parties since the complaining party continues to state
that he has not obtained the medical history and, the claimed party on the contrary manifests

having attended the right but does not document the sending and delivery of the
clinical history to the claimant.
Apart from other discrepancies, they must be resolved in the corresponding forums
and, considering that the purpose of the present procedure is that the guarantees and
the rights of those affected are duly restored, proceeds to estimate the
present claim.

Considering the cited precepts and others of general application,
