## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against an energy company. The company had called them for commercial reasons, despite the data subject having signed up for the Robinson List a few months before. A Robinson List is an opt-out list for people who do not wish to receive marketing communications.

### Holding

The AEPD remarked that the [Spanish Telecommunications Act](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2014-4950) (LGT) forbids, in its Article 48(1)(b), commercial communications when the subject has opposed to them. The DPA also related this prohibition to [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"), which gives the data subject the right to oppose to the processing of their personal data.

The controller alleged that the LGT was not applicable to the case, since the main activity of the energy company is not related to telecommunications. However, the DPA argued that Article 48(1)(b) GDPR is applicable to commercial communications, regardless of the main activity of the company that carries out such communications.

Therefore, the AEPD concluded that the controller had ignored the right to oppose to the processing of the data subject, exercised via the inclusion in the Robinson List, and therefore violated Article 48(1)(b) GDPR. The DPA fined the controller €12,000.

                              FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

In accordance with the provisions of article 84.3) of the LGT, the competence to
initiate and resolve this Penalty Procedure corresponds to the Director of

the Spanish Agency for Data Protection.

                                             II

Regarding the allegations presented by the person responsible for the claim, it is necessary to
note the following:

It is proven before this AEPD that the treatment now analyzed by the aforementioned
entity is carried out in the name and on behalf of the claimed party, the latter acting in
quality of person in charge when defining the purpose and means. In this regard, the very
claimed brings up that the call to the claimant was made by a commercial agent

external, which has a commercial relationship with the claimed and which they have communicated by
written to the commercial agent that the claimant does not wish to receive advertising calls and
This confirms that it has proceeded to delete your data.

From the allegation itself it is inferred that the complained party is responsible for the treatment

now analyzed, since the defendant confirms that he is the one who facilitates the
instructions for the treatment that is entrusted to the entities that use their
own databases on purpose and means.

The defendant adds that the LGT is not applicable to him, as it is a company that is dedicated
to acquire energy for sale to the final consumer.

Well, the scope of the LGT is telephone calls as in the
present case, regardless of the subject who carried them out.

Consequently, the LGT is fully applicable to the defendant.

which indicates that the final consumer b) To oppose receiving unwanted calls with
commercial communication purposes that are carried out through systems other than those

established in the previous letter and to be informed of this right. ".

received a call on May 15, 2020 from line \*\*\* TELEPHONE. 2, from
advertising content to your line number (\*\*\* PHONE. 1) despite being included

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/8

on ADigital's robinson advertising exclusion list since March 16,
2010.

On the other hand, the defendant states that in the documentation of this
sanctioning procedure a single call made is identified with date and time
to the claimant, although no documentary proof of it is provided, not even
a screenshot and thus makes the call unable to be framed in the
infringement contained in article 48.1.b) of the LGT.

As has been indicated, the claimant has provided screenshots of the

Robinson List service where the mobile number is included where it has been
received the call and where the section relating to “Energy and
water: products related to electricity, hydrocarbons, gas and water ”, such as
type of company to be blocked, and also accredits the call received.

Consequently, the allegations must be rejected.
