## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was a lawyer who had an account at a bank (the controller). On 25 November 2020, the data subject sent a written complaint to the bank on behalf of a client who was a customer of the same bank. On 1 December 2020, the bank handed over a reply to the customer and indicated thereon the data subject’s private address which they kept in their private customer file. Thereby, the bank disclosed the lawyer’s home address to a third party (represented customer).

### Holding

The Spanish DPA first held that the processing of the data subject’s personal data – more precisely their home address – carried out in the context of the handling of a customer complaint which was filed by the data subject in their capacity as the customer’s lawyer constituted a breach of the principle of “purpose limitation” outlined in [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR"), because the personal data was processed in a way that did not comply with the purposes for which the data originally had been collected. Namely, the controller had collected the data for establishing a personal bank account for the data subject.

Furthermore, the DPA detected a violation of [Article 32](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"), because the fact that a third party (customer) was given unauthorised access to information relating to the data subject leads to the conclusion that the controller had not effectively adopted the appropriate technical-organisational measures to prevent such an incident.

The DPA found that the controller also infringed [Article 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") which enshrines the “principle of integrity and confidentiality”. As already stated above, the controller disclosed the home address of the data subject to a third party without a legal basis – such a leak is contrary to the duty of confidentiality. Even though the controller declared that the incident was a one-off error, the DPA held them liable, because such an error runs counter to the diligence that it must adhere to and a lack of diligence is also considered as culpable behaviour.

The Spanish DPA fined the controller €50,000 for breaching [Articles 5(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR") and [5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and another €20,000 for breaching [Article 32](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). However, the DPA did not request that the controller brings, in accordance with [Article 58(2)(d)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2d "Article 58 GDPR"), their processing behaviour in compliance with the GDPR, because the case only concerned the misused data of a single person and the mistake had already been corrected.

this third person.

                                               III

The facts presented, in relation to the use of the personal data of the party
claimant relative to his or her private address for the processing of a claim
formulated by him in the name and representation of a third party, acting under his
status of lawyer, without there being legitimate cause for it, represent a

non-compliance with the principle of “limitation of purpose” regulated in article 5.1.b)
of the GDPR, which establishes the following:

“1.Personal data will be:
(…)
b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be further processed

in a manner incompatible with said purposes; In accordance with Article 89, paragraph 1, the
further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, purposes of
scientific and historical research or statistical purposes will not be considered incompatible with the
initial purposes (“purpose limitation”).

In relation to the principles regulated in the aforementioned article 5 of the RGPD, it is taken into account

Consider what is stated in Recital 39 of the aforementioned GDPR:

“39. All processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. For natural persons, it must

Personal data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes

reasonable measures to ensure that personal data that is
inaccurate. Personal data must be processed in a way that guarantees security and
appropriate confidentiality of personal data, including to prevent unauthorized access or use

In the present case, BBVA processed the personal data of the party
claimant incompatible with the purposes that determined the collection of such
data.
Consequently, the aforementioned facts violate the provisions of article 5.1.b) of the

RGPD, giving rise to the application of the corrective powers that article 58 of the
cited Regulation grants to the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

                                              IV

Article 32 of the GDPR, “Security of processing”, establishes the following:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of application, and the nature, the
scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of probability and severity
variables for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the person responsible and the person in charge
of the treatment will apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level

of security appropriate to the risk, which, where appropriate, includes, among others:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience
permanent treatment systems and services;
c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a manner
fast in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the measures

technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to the
risks presented by data processing, in particular as a consequence of the
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of transmitted personal data,
preserved or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to such
data.

3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or to a mechanism of
certification approved in accordance with article 42 may serve as an element to demonstrate the
compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of this article.

4. The controller and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to ensure that
any person acting under the authority of the person responsible or in charge and has access
personal data can only process said data following instructions from the person responsible,

unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of Union or Member State law.”

The GDPR defines personal data security breaches as “any
those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or

accidental or illicit alteration of personal data transmitted, preserved or processed
otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.”

It should be noted that the GDPR does not establish a list of security measures

that are applicable in accordance with the data that is the object of processing, but
which establishes that the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply measures
technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk involved in the treatment,
taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, the nature,

scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the probability and severity risks
for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

Likewise, security measures must be appropriate and proportionate to the

detected risk, pointing out that the determination of the technical measures and
organizational measures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and encryption,
ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience, the
ability to restore availability and access to data after an incident, process

In this same sense, recital 83 of the GDPR states that:

“(83) In order to maintain security and prevent the treatment from violating the provisions of the
This Regulation, the controller or processor must evaluate the risks inherent to the
treatment and apply mitigation measures, such as encryption. These measures must guarantee
an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the status of

In accordance with what is expressed in Considering 74 of the RGPD, the person responsible for the

treatment it is necessary to be able to demonstrate that the measures adopted are effective:

“The responsibility of the person responsible for the treatment must be established for any
processing of personal data carried out by himself or on his own account. In particular, the
responsible must be obliged to apply timely and effective measures and must be able to
demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation,
including the effectiveness of the measures. These measures must take into account the nature,

of natural persons.”

These technical and organizational measures are included as part of the principle of
active responsibility, which requires a prior assessment by the person responsible

personal data processing they carry out.

Whether these measures are mandatory, or how they are applied, will depend on
factors that must be taken into account in each case, such as the type of treatment and the
risk that such processing implies for the rights and freedoms of the interested parties.
Consequently, due diligence must be adapted to the level of risks in the

The aforementioned article 5 of the RGPD establishes the principles that must govern the
processing of personal data and mentions, among them, “integrity and
confidentiality”:

claimed entity derives from an error. Admit that it is not appropriate to demand responsibility from
BBVA for the facts analyzed, based on an alleged error, would be as much as
admit that the application of the RGPD and the LOPDGDD can be ignored.

In this regard, it must be remembered that when the error is a sign of a lack of
diligence type is applicable. The National Court in Judgment of 21
September 2004 (RCA 937/2003), is pronounced in the following terms:

“Furthermore, regarding the application of the principle of guilt, it is (following the criterion of

this Chamber in other Judgments such as the one dated January 21, 2004 issued in the appeal
1139/2001) that the commission of the infraction provided for in article 44.3.d) can be either
malicious as well as culpable. And in this sense, if the error is a sign of a lack of diligence, the type
is applicable…".

Along these lines, it is worth mentioning the SAN of January 21, 2010, in which the Court

exposes:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/17

“The appellant also maintains that there is no culpability in her actions. Is
It is true that the principle of guilt prevents the admission in administrative law
sanctioning of objective liability, it is also true that the absence of
Intentionality is secondary since this type of infractions are normally committed

for a culpable or negligent act, which is sufficient to integrate the subjective element
of guilt. XXX's actions are clearly negligent because... he must know... the
obligations imposed by the LOPD on all those who handle personal data of third parties.
XXX is obliged to guarantee the fundamental right to the protection of personal data
of its clients and hypothetical clients with the intensity required by the content of its own
right".

The principle of guilt is required in the sanctioning procedure and thus the STC
246/1991 considers inadmissible in the field of administrative sanctioning law
a responsibility without guilt. But the principle of guilt does not imply that only
sanction an intentional or voluntary action, and in this regard article 28

of Law 40/2015 on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector, under the rubric
“Responsibility” provides the following:

"1. Only those who may be sanctioned for acts constituting an administrative offense
natural and legal persons, as well as, when a Law recognizes their capacity to act, the
groups of affected people, unions and entities without legal personality and assets
independent or autonomous, who are responsible for them by way of fraud or

blame".

The facts presented show that BBVA did not act with due diligence to the
that she was forced, that she acted with a lack of diligence. The Supreme Court (Judgments
of 04/16 and 04/22/1991) considers that from the culpable element it follows “...that the

action or omission, qualified as an administratively sanctionable infraction, must be,
in any case, attributable to its author, due to fraud or imprudence, negligence or ignorance
inexcusable". The same Court reasons that “it is not enough... for exculpation against
"invoking the absence of fault is typically illegal behavior" but

that it is necessary to prove “that the diligence that was required by whoever has been used
claims its non-existence” (STS January 23, 1998).

Also connected with the degree of diligence that the person responsible for the treatment is
obliged to deploy in compliance with the obligations imposed by the

data protection regulations, the SAN of 10/17/2007 (Rec. 63/2006) can be cited,
which specified: “(...) the Supreme Court has been understanding that there is imprudence
whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is, when the offender fails
"behaves with the required diligence."

Furthermore, the National Court, in matters of data protection of
personal character, has declared that “simple negligence or non-compliance with
the duties that the Law imposes on the people responsible for files or the
data processing to exercise extreme diligence…” (SAN 06/29/2001).

                                            VII

In the event that there is a violation of the provisions of the RGPD, among the

corrective powers available to the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
as a control authority, article 58.2 of said Regulation contemplates the
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/17

following:

“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers indicated below:
continuation:
(…)
b) send a warning to any person responsible or in charge of processing when the

processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation;”
(...)
d) order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the treatment operations are

manner and within a specified period;
(…)
i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with Article 83, in addition to or instead of the
measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each case

particular;".

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in letter d)
above is compatible with the sanction consisting of an administrative fine.

                                             VIII

Failure to comply with the provisions of article 5.1.b) and f) of the RGPD means the
commission of separate infractions classified in section 5.a) of article 83 of the
RGPD, which under the heading “General conditions for the imposition of fines
administrative” provides the following:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a
company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual turnover
overall of the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent to

tenor of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9”.

On the other hand, the violation of article 32 of the RGPD is classified in the
article 83.4.a) of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:

"4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 or, in the case of a
company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the total annual turnover
overall of the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:

a) the obligations of the controller and the processor in accordance with articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 42 and
43.

(…)”.

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 establishes that “They constitute
infractions the acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the

article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the
present organic law.”

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 of the LOPDGDD indicates:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/17

“Article 72. Infractions considered very serious.

1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, they are considered
very serious and the infractions that involve a violation will expire after three years.

substance of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees established in the
article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

And in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, it qualifies as “Infringements considered

serious”:

“Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, they are considered
serious violations and violations that involve a substantial violation will expire after two years.
of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

(…)
f) The lack of adoption of those technical and organizational measures that are appropriate
to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk of the treatment, in the terms
required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
g) The breach, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence, of the measures
technical and organizational measures that have been implemented in accordance with the requirements of article 32.1
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

(…)”

In this case, in light of the facts presented, it is considered that the sanction that

It would be appropriate to impose an administrative fine.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate
and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of article 83.1 of the RGPD.

In order to determine the administrative fine to impose, the following must be observed:
provisions of article 83, section 2, of the GDPR, which states the following:

"2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each case.
individually, as an additional or substitute for the measures contemplated in article 58,
section 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount
In each individual case due account will be taken of:
a) the nature, severity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature,
scope or purpose of the processing operation in question as well as the number of
interested parties affected and the level of damages they have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) any measure taken by the person responsible or in charge of the treatment to alleviate the
damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;
d) the degree of responsibility of the person responsible or in charge of the treatment, taking into account
of the technical or organizational measures that have been applied under articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous infringement committed by the controller or processor;
f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the

infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in particular if the
responsible or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so, to what extent;
i) when the measures indicated in Article 58, paragraph 2, have been ordered
previously against the person responsible or the person in charge in question in relation to the same

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/17

matter, compliance with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or certification mechanisms

approved in accordance with article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as
financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through
the infringement.”

For its part, in relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in

its article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 will be applied taking into account the graduation criteria established in the
section 2 of the aforementioned article.
2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also
may be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.
b) The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of data processing
personal.
c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.
d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected person could have induced the commission of the
infringement.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process after the commission of the infraction,

which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.
f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection delegate.
h) The submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which there are
controversies between those and any interested party.”

In accordance with the indicated precepts, for the purposes of setting the amount of the sanctions
to be imposed in the present case, it is considered that it is appropriate to graduate them in accordance with
the following criteria established by the transcribed precepts:

In this case, the graduation criteria are considered concurrent as aggravating factors.
following:

     . Article 83.2.b) of the RGPD: “b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement."

     The negligence appreciated in the commission of the infraction, considering that the
     claimed party used the personal data of the complaining party registered in
     the entity in its capacity as client, without taking into account that it intervened in the
     made in the name and representation of a third party.

     In this regard, what was stated in the Court's Judgment is taken into account.
     National of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006) that, assuming that these are entities
     whose activity involves continuous data processing, indicates that “…the

     Supreme Court has been understanding that imprudence exists whenever
     disregards a legal duty of care, that is, when the offender fails to comply
     behaves with the required diligence. And in assessing the degree of diligence,
     The professionalism or not of the subject must be especially considered, and there is no doubt
     that, in the case now examined, when the appellant's activity is

     constant and abundant handling of personal data, we must insist on the
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/17

    rigor and exquisite care to comply with the legal provisions in this regard.”

    It is an entity that processes personal data in a manner

    systematic and continuous and that must take extreme care in fulfilling its
    data protection obligations.

    This Agency understands that diligence has to be deduced from facts
    conclusive, duly accredited and directly related
    with the elements that make up the infringement, in such a way that it can be deduced

    that it has occurred despite all the means arranged by the
    responsible to avoid it. In this case, the actions of the claimed party do not
    It has this character.

    . Article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD: “b) The linking of the offender's activity

    with the processing of personal data.”

    The high link between the offender's activity and the performance of treatments
    of personal data. The level of implementation of the entity and the
    activity that it carries out, in which personal data of millions is involved
    of interested parties. This circumstance determines a higher degree of demand and

    professionalism and, consequently, the responsibility of the entity
    claimed in relation to the processing of the data.

    . Article 83.2.k) of the RGPD: “k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor
    applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained

    or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.”

         . BBVA's status as a large company and business volume. It consists of
         the actions that said entity has (...).

It is also considered that the following circumstance occurs as a mitigating circumstance:

    . Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR: “a) the nature, severity and duration of the
    infringement, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the operation
    treatment in question as well as the number of interested parties affected and the
    level of damages and losses they have suffered.”

    The infringement is an anomaly that affects only the complaining party.

Considering the factors exposed, the value reached by the fines for the
imputed infractions is 25,000 euros (twenty-five thousand euros) for the infractions

very serious (violation of articles 5.1.b) and 5.1.f) of the RGPD) and 20,000 euros
(twenty thousand euros) for the serious infraction (violation of the provisions of article 32
of the GDPR).

                                           IX

Once the infractions are confirmed, it could be agreed to impose on the person responsible the adoption of
appropriate measures to adjust its actions to the regulations mentioned in this
act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD, according to the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/17

which each control authority may “order the person responsible or in charge of the
treatment that the processing operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain manner and within a

specified period…”

In such case, this Agency could require the person responsible to adapt the
processing of personal data carried out in accordance with data protection regulations
in accordance with what is indicated in the preceding Legal Fundamentals.

This case affects only the complaining party and has to do with the
improper use and communication of the personal data of the complaining party related to
his personal address, on the occasion of a claim in which he intervened under the
status as representative of the interested person; and the BBVA entity has
stated that this circumstance was subsequently corrected. That being so, it is not possible

In this case, urge the adoption of measures by the person responsible for the treatment.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and evaluated the criteria of
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
