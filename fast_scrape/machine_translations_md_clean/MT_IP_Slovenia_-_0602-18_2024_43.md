## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject made an access request to the controller, a solar power plant company, but the latter failed to respond.

The data subject lodged a complaint before the DPA (Information Commissioner of the Republic of Slovenia - IP). The DPA ordered the controller to respond to the data subject’s request in writing within 15 days.

The controller claimed that it did not fail to respond to the access request. It argued it asked the data subject to clarify which copies of his personal data he wanted because the request was too unspecific to be granted. Since the data subject did not clarify, it provided him with information about how it generally processes personal data, under [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR"). In addition, it invited the data subject to its premises to inspect the data concerning him. However, he reminded the data subject of his obligation to pay a fee for the copies if he insisted on the entire set of the data.

Even after multiple orders and warnings from the DPA, the controller still refused to provide the data subject with a full copy of his data without justification. Eventually, it provided a full copy.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller did not reply to the data subject's access request within one month nor did it inform the data subject of a possible extension within the same time limit, according to [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR").

It also found that the controller failed to reply to the data subject’s request in line with [Article 12](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"), but instead gave him general information about the processing, a description of the data and reference to the categories of personal data processed. It also pointed out that it violated the data subject’s right to obtain a full copy of his data free of charge, pursuant to [Article 15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3 "Article 15 GDPR"), pointing out that the mere inspection was not sufficient.

Nevertheless, since the controller eventually fully complied, the DPA concluded that there were no grounds for imposing any measures as it has already remedied the infringements identified. In addition, the DPA pointed out that the controller would be sanctioned accordingly for the infringement of [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") in the context of additional proceedings conducted by the DPA.

Number: 0602-18/2024/43
Date: 4. 6. 2025
The Information Commissioner (hereinafter referred to as the IP) issues, pursuant to the second paragraph
of Article 58 and Article 77 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the
protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter referred to as the General Regulation), Articles 25 and 34 in connection with point 2
of the first paragraph of Article 55 of the Personal Data Protection Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 163/22; hereinafter
ZVOP-2) and the first paragraph of Article 251 of the General Administrative Procedure Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No.
24/06 – official consolidated text, 105/06 – ZUS-1, 126/07, 65/08, 8/10, 82/13, 175/20 – ZIUOPDVE
and 3/22 – ZDeb, hereinafter ZUP) on the application of the applicant with a special position: … (hereinafter
the applicant) dated …, against: … (hereinafter
the controller), in the matter of exercising the right to access to
personal data
D O U C T I O N:
I. It is established that the controller … at the time of filing the application … …. violated Article 12 in connection with Article 15
of the General Regulation and Article 14 of the ZVOP-2, because it did not respond to the applicant in a timely and comprehensive manner to
his request for access to personal data dated ….. The application is granted in this part.
II. It is established that the controller … subsequently, after the expiry of the deadline referred to in the third paragraph of Article 12 of the General
Regulation, fulfilled its obligations under Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation in relation to Article 14 of the ZVOP-2. In this part, the application is rejected.
III. No measures regarding the processing of personal data shall be ordered against the controller ….
IV. No restrictions shall be imposed on the applicant … regarding the inspection of the case file, which is kept under No. 0602-
18/2024.
V. No special costs have been incurred in these proceedings, and each party shall bear its own costs of the proceedings.
R e p o n t i o n s:
The course of the proceedings so far and relevant statements
1. IP has …. received a report of a personal data protection breach, in which the applicant accused the controller of not having responded to his request for access to his own personal data dated …..
2. Therefore, IP …. called on the controller to decide in writing on the applicant's request within 15 days of receipt of the request in accordance with Articles 12 and 15 of the General Regulation in relation to Article 14 of the ZVOP-2 and to notify him thereof. Since the controller did not respond within this period, on … the IP again called on him to break the silence.
3. The controller …. IP forwarded a response to the applicant, which was given on behalf of the company … Since the response of this company cannot be considered the response of the controller in this procedure, and in addition, the applicant requested copies of his own personal data and not general explanations under Article 12 of the General Regulation, which are given in this response, the IP … again called on the controller to decide on the applicant's request for access to personal data within 5 days of receipt of the request. In addition, the IP warned the controller that in the event of non-cooperation with the supervisory authority or violation of the right to the protection of personal data, he could be held liable for a misdemeanor. 4. In the response dated …, which was sent by the IP for information, the controller explained to the complainant that his request was not sufficiently specified to be granted, and that he was asked to explain which copies of personal data he wanted, and in order to resolve the matter more simply, he was also asked to appear at the controller's headquarters and check for himself which documentation the controller kept and which copies of personal data he wanted. He explained that the complainant's request had therefore not been rejected and that the controller did not remain passive, but that the complainant had misinterpreted the response and the invitation to the company's headquarters to familiarize himself with the documentation. Given the large amount of documentation kept by the controller and from the perspective of economy, he again invited the complainant to view the documentation, explaining that he should consider this a positive decision. If the applicant nevertheless insisted on providing the entire set of documents, he was warned of the obligation to pay a fee for copies. 5. Given the content of this response, the IP requested the controller … to call the supervisory person conducting the procedure for additional clarifications regarding the right to access. In a telephone conversation with …, the controller explained that the company had done everything possible regarding the applicant's request for access to his personal data and had also invited him to their headquarters to view all the documentation and specify which copies of which documents he wanted. With regard to the response of …, the IP explained that this was not a decision under Article 14 of the ZVOP-2 and that the applicant had not requested additional copies, which would entitle him to charge costs in accordance with the General Regulation. If the individual does not specify the request and insists on obtaining all the data, the controller is in principle obliged to provide access to it (not just a view, but copies, if requested), unless it deems the request excessive, which must be duly substantiated. In such a case, it may refuse the request or charge costs. In addition, the IP pointed out that the applicant also specified in the e-mail dated .... exactly which data he wanted and in what form. Therefore, the controller said that he would respond to the applicant as soon as possible in accordance with Article 14 of the ZVOP-2 and provide him with the personal data he requested, of which the IP informed the applicant. 6. On ..., the IP received a new response from the controller, which he sent to the applicant, and on ..., copies of the documents with the applicant's personal data, which he sent to the applicant. In addition, the controller explained to the applicant that he could access all other data himself. 7. Then, the complainant informed IP … that, despite repeated requests, the controller had still not responded in full to his request for access to his personal data and had not provided him with all the requested personal data relating to him. These are 1) his personal data in the complaint procedures and 2) his data that he had provided to the company …. Therefore, IP … sent an electronic request to the controller to immediately make an explicit and clear decision on the complainant’s request and to also provide it to IP, as the procedure had been taking a very long time. He warned him that the decision must be in accordance with Article 14 of the ZVOP-2, which means that it must provide him with the requested personal data or refuse his request with a reasoned explanation (for example, if there are certain restrictions, if it does not concern his personal data or if he does not have such personal data, etc.). He added again that in the event of non-cooperation with the supervisory authority or violation of the right to the protection of personal data, he may be held liable for a misdemeanor. 8. Since the controller did not respond to this request either, the IP once again (by personal delivery to the company's registered office) invited him to make a written decision on the applicant's request in full (i.e. on the still missing data or the 3 processing information that the applicant points out) within 10 days in accordance with Articles 12 and 15 of the General Regulation in connection with Article 14 of the ZVOP-2 and to inform the IP thereof. He added that the IP had informed the controller ... in misdemeanor case no. ... has already sent a written notification to state the facts or circumstances of the offence under the first paragraph of Article 95 of the ZVOP-2 in connection with point b) of the fifth paragraph of Article 83 of the General Regulation, and explained that the conduct in this procedure may also affect the issue of a possible warning or the type of a possible sanction or the amount of a possible fine in the misdemeanor procedure (cf. the second paragraph of Article 83 of the General Regulation) as an aggravating or mitigating factor. Therefore, he suggested to the operator to act as soon as possible in accordance with the IP's request and to decide on the applicant's request within the set deadline at the latest. 9. On ..., the IP received for information the response that the operator sent to the applicant. In this response, the operator stated that the company ... was only carrying out repairs .... for the company ... and that he received his
personal data from this company (such as name, surname, address, telephone number, ID .... with location
and description of the error). For this company, he corrected the reported error at the location itself and informed them of this with
new numbers of optimizers and replaced components. He explained that the operator had never communicated with the company ... regarding the complainant, and had not provided him with any personal data.
The complainant's request for the provision of other personal data in the complaint procedure and the procedure for the provision of personal data to the company ... was therefore rejected, and all other data that they had at their disposal were not the subject of the complainant's personal data and were a business secret. He expressly stated that he did not have any other personal data of the complainant. In a letter dated ..., the IP operator additionally announced that he had fully complied with the complainant's request and that he considered the
matter to be closed.
10. The complainant also IP dated .... forwarded for information the operator's above response, and responded to it with statements relating to the communication between the operator and the company ... and to the warranty rights. 11. Based on the established facts, the IP .... issued a record of findings essential for the decision in this procedure and a call for a statement before the decision, to which no party responded within the set deadline. However, on ... and ... the applicant forwarded the e-mails that he had sent to the operator to the IP for information. In these messages, he thanked for the documents, personal data and the warranty statement provided, but pointed out some shortcomings. He stressed that the warranty statement did not include the 14 new optimizers that were installed ..., that the report on warranty work states a 10-year warranty, but that it most likely concerns the professionalism of the repair, and that he could not find the messages and content of the responses ... in the documents, but only automatic responses. He requested the completion of the documentation, including the minutes of the complaint work and all communication with …, and in the last message he warned that the 15-day deadline for responding to the IP's request would expire the next day.
12. Since the IP assessed that the factual situation for a decision in this case had been fully established, he did not perform any other procedural actions.
Supervisory procedure
13. The IP handled the submitted application in a procedure conducted at the request of the applicant with a special position
(Articles 30 and 31 of the ZVOP-2), thus ensuring the right to appeal under Article 77 of the General Regulation.
This procedure is characterized, among other things, by the fact that the IP acts in accordance with the powers under Article 58 of the General
Regulation and Articles 28 and 29 of the ZVOP-2 and taking into account Article 25 of the ZVOP-2 in accordance with the general rules of the ZUP.
14. In accordance with Article 14 of the ZVOP-2, controllers that are not state authorities or self-governing local communities,
on a request for access to personal data, inform the individual of the decision and, if this is the subject of
4 the request, of the personal data relating to him/her, within the period specified in the General Regulation. If the individual so requests, he/she may also be informed of the personal data orally. The decision must contain
reasons and information on the right to appeal to the supervisory authority within 15 days of being informed of the
decision pursuant to the provisions of point f) of the first paragraph of Article 15 of the General Regulation. The decision may take the form of an official note sent to the individual in a manner that allows for the individual to be informed of the decision and to prove its receipt. 15. The IP, as the supervisory authority, shall, after the supervision procedure in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 34 of the ZVOP-2, issue a decision which, in addition to the elements specified in the law governing the general administrative procedure, shall contain: I) a finding on the existence or non-existence of the alleged violation of the processing of personal data of the complainant with a special situation at the time of filing the report; II) measures ordered to the controller or processor regarding the processing of personal data relating to the complainant with a special situation and the deadline for their implementation; III) the permitted scope of the review of the case file for the complainant with a special situation. General information on the right to access one's own personal data
16. The right of an individual to be informed of personal data is a fundamental human right, stipulated in the
third paragraph of Article 38 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 33/91-I, as amended
and supplemented), which stipulates that everyone has the right to be informed of the personal data collected relating to them. A similar provision is also contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which stipulates in Article 8, point 2, that everyone has the right of access to data collected about them. This right, known as the right of access of the data subject, is specified in Article 15 of the General Regulation, which provides in its first paragraph that the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller 1) confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed and, where that is the case, 2) access to the personal data and 3) the following information:
(a) the purposes of the processing;
(b) the categories of personal data concerned;
(c) the users or categories of users to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular users in third countries or international organisations;
(d) where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored or, where that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;
(e) the existence of the right to obtain from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of the processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or the existence of the right to object to such processing;
(f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
(g) where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, all available information as to their source;
(h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling referred to in Article 22(1) and
(4), and at least in such cases, meaningful information on the reasons for it, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.
17. The time limit for the controller to respond shall be one month from receipt of the request. That time limit may be extended, where necessary, by a maximum of two additional months, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The controller shall, however, inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay (Article 12(3) of the GDPR).
5
18. A request may be refused if the basic conditions for access are not met (e.g. because it does not concern personal data at all, because it does not concern the personal data of the applicant, because the requested personal data do not exist, etc.), if the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or if specific restrictions are laid down in the constitution, international instruments or sectoral laws.
Assessment of the merits of the application
19. In this case, the IP found that the controller did not respond to the applicant's request dated …, which it sent by e-mail to the addresses …, … and … within one month of receiving the request for access to its own personal data pursuant to Article 15 of the General Regulation, nor did it inform the applicant within the same period of time of a possible extension of the deadline for a decision.
20. As follows from the review of the course of this procedure, the controller responded to the applicant's request for access to personal data several times following IP's requests, but these responses were not in accordance with Articles 12 and 15 of the General Regulation in relation to Article 14 of the ZVOP-2. The response dated …, which was sent to the applicant, was given on behalf of another legal entity and did not meet the criteria for the specificity of the response required by Article 15 of the General Regulation. The right under Article 15 of the General Regulation
namely means the right of access to the actual personal data, and not only general information about
processing, a description of the data or a reference to the categories of personal data processed by the controller.
According to the third paragraph of this provision, the data subject also has
the right to a copy of the personal data being processed (not just to view it).
21. The controller's response of … was also not adequate. IP explains that the scope of the right of access under
Article 15 of the General Regulation is determined by the scope of the concept of personal data, which is defined in the first
paragraph of Article 4 of this Regulation. The right of access refers to personal data about the person who makes the
request. If an individual requests all data that the controller processes in relation to him, he has, in principle, the right to obtain it, unless specific restrictions are given in the specific case. On the basis of Article 15(3) of the GDPR, however, it may charge a reasonable fee only in the event that additional copies of personal data are required, which the controller has not claimed in these proceedings. With regard to the invitation to inspect documents at the controller's registered office, it should be clarified that, in accordance with the first sentence of Article 15(3) of the GDPR, the controller is obliged to provide the individual with a copy of the personal data to which the processing relates, free of charge. The controller must ensure that the first copy is free of charge, even if the controller considers that the reproduction costs are high. In general, the individual does not have to provide any additional information when providing the copy; the scope of information that the copy must contain is the scope of access to the data referred to in Article 15(1) of the GDPR, which includes all the information necessary to enable the data subject to understand the processing and verify its lawfulness. The controller may, in some circumstances, provide access by means other than by providing a copy, for example by on-site access, if this is in the interest of the individual. However, providing access by means other than by providing a copy does not prevent individuals from having a copy, unless they choose otherwise. 22. The controller then sent the complainant a response and copies of documents containing the complainant's personal data on … and …, but - as the complainant pointed out - it still did not provide copies of all the requested personal data, namely: 1) the complainant's personal data in the complaint procedures and 2) the complainant's data that it provided to the company …. 23. In relation to this data, the controller explained to the complainant in its response of … that it was a solar power plant repairer for another company and stated that it had never communicated with the company … regarding the complainant and had not provided it with any personal data. Because he used other personal data of the complainant than those he had already provided to him, he rejected his request.
24. In response to the controller's last (negative) response, which the IP received for information only,
the complainant questioned the authenticity of the information regarding the communication between the controller and the company ..., and
provided statements regarding warranty rights and the maintenance contract. These statements of the complainant dated ..., however, could not be considered by the IP as a report on the negative response dated ..., and the complainant did not file a separate report against this response within the fifteen-day period referred to in the second paragraph of Article 14 of the ZVOP-2 in connection with point f) of the first paragraph of Article 15 of the General Regulation.
25. The same applies to the electronic messages to the controller dated ... and ..., which the complainant sent to the IP for information only after the notification of the record of essential findings. IP could not consider these statements as a definition or objection to this record, but only as additional questions and clarifications regarding the procedure or content of the communication between the controller and the company ... and regarding warranty rights and the maintenance contract, outside the scope of the request under Article 15 of the General Regulation. It is therefore part of a broader communication that was forwarded to IP for information only, and not as a formal legally relevant application or definition for the record of essential findings. 26. In view of the above, IP is convinced that the controller subsequently, after the expiry of the deadline referred to in the third paragraph of Article 12 of the General Regulation and following IP's requests, fully fulfilled its obligations in relation to the applicant's request for access to personal data under Article 15 of the General Regulation in relation to Article 14 of the ZVOP-2, as it was asserted. During this supervisory procedure, the controller thus fully responded to the complainant's request for access to personal data and provided him with the personal data relating to him within the framework of this request, while rejecting the request regarding data that it does not have or that are not the complainant's personal data. In conclusion, the 27th IP found in this procedure that the controller did not respond in a timely manner and fully to the complainant's request for access to personal data dated ..., thereby violating the provisions of Article 12 in conjunction with Article 15 of the General Regulation and Article 14 of the ZVOP-2. Subsequently, after the deadline had expired and following the IP's requests, the controller fulfilled its obligations, provided the complainant with copies of the personal data to which he was entitled within the framework of the submitted request, and refused access to data that were not personal data or that it did not have. Therefore, after completing the procedure, it partially granted the IP's application and partially rejected it.
Measures regarding the processing of personal data
28. In accordance with the reasoning, the IP concludes that there are no grounds for ordering measures regarding the processing of personal data within the meaning of point 2 of the first paragraph of Article 34 of the ZVOP-2, since the controller has already eliminated the identified violations (point III of the operative part of the decision). In addition, the IP points out that the controller may be subject to appropriate minor offence sanctions for violations of Article 12 of the General Regulation within the framework of the procedure conducted by the IP under No. …. In this framework, the IP has introduced an additional procedure in which it will act in accordance with the powers it has as a minor offence authority and in this way take preventive action against the controller. In view of this, the IP concludes that further measures to ensure compliance are not necessary.
Permitted scope of file review
7
29. Point 3 of the first paragraph of Article 34 of the ZVOP-2 stipulates that a decision in a supervision procedure pursuant to the provisions of this section, in addition to the components specified by the law governing general administrative procedure,
also contains the permitted scope of review of the case file for a reporting person with a special situation.
30. The IP concludes that there are no reasons to limit the permitted scope of the case file. Therefore, it decided
that no restrictions should be imposed on the reporting person regarding the review of the case file, which is kept under No. 0602-
18/2024 (point IV of the operative part of this decision).
Costs of the procedure
31. Pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 118 of the ZUP, the authority shall decide in its decision on the costs of the procedure, who bears the costs of the procedure, how much they amount and to whom and within what period they must be paid. No special costs were incurred in this supervision procedure. The applicant and the operator shall each cover their own costs that may have been incurred as a result of the procedure (second paragraph of Article 30 of the ZVOP-2; point V of the operative part of this decision).
32. This decision is exempt from payment of the administrative fee in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Fees Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 106/10 - official consolidated text, with amendments and supplements).
Instructions on legal remedies:
This decision is not subject to appeal, but it is permissible to initiate an administrative dispute. An administrative dispute shall be initiated by filing a lawsuit with the Administrative Court, Fajfarjeva 33, 1000 Ljubljana. The lawsuit must be filed within thirty days of the service of this decision, in writing directly with the aforementioned court or by registered mail or orally for the record. If the claim is sent by registered mail, it shall be deemed to have been received on time if it was delivered to the post office on the last day of the deadline for filing the claim.
