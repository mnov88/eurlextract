## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject placed an online order with a shop (the controller) on eBay. More than half a year later, the controller started sending them weekly newsletters via email. Although the controller's privacy policy claimed that newsletters would only be sent if the data subject had given consent, [Article 6(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a "Article 6 GDPR"), the data subject had never consented.

On 5 November 2020, the data subject sent an access request to the controller, invoking their right laid down in [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR"). Since the controller did not reply, the data subject sent a reminder on 7 December 2020. Again, the controller did not reply.

Initially, the controller didn't respond to the DPA's request for a statement. Only after the DPA issued an administrative notice forcing the company to answer the access request and threatened a penalty payment did the controller respond to the data subject.

However, this initial response only mentioned the categories of processed personal data and did not include a copy of the personal data. Only after another reclamation by the data subject did the controller provide a copy.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"), since the newsletter was sent without a legal basis. First, the data subject had not given consent, [Article 6(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a "Article 6 GDPR"). Moreover, the DPA held that the controller could not rely on a legitimate interest, [Article 6(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). While the term "legitimate interest" is to be interpreted broadly, it can no longer be assumed if the processing violates another legal norm.

§ 7(2)(3) UWG (German Act against Unfair Competition) declares advertising using electronic mail without the addressee's prior express consent as an "unacceptable nuisance". The exemption under § 7(3)(4) UWG only applies if the controller clearly and unequivocally informed the data subject, at the time of the collection of the email address, that it will be used for advertising purposes. The controller had not done that by their own admission. Thus, the DPA concluded that the data subject's interests and fundamental rights overrode the controller's and no legitimate interest could be assumed. Hence, the controller violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

The DPA further held that the controller had violated [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR") by not responding to the data subject's access request within a period of one month.

Lastly, the DPA held that the controller violated [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR"), since they provided an incomplete response to the data subject's access request. In addition to the abstract categories of data, the controller must provide the actual personal data processed. Furthermore, the controller did not inform the data subject about the recipients of the personal data, [Article 15(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1c "Article 15 GDPR"). The DPA held that this has to include processors according to [Article 28 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR "Article 28 GDPR"). Finally, the controller provided incomplete information about the period for which the personal data is stored, [Article 15(1)(d)](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1d "Article 15 GDPR"). The controller had only mentioned that the period was based on legal retention periods according to § 257 HGB and § 147 AO but the DPA held that this did not fulfil the requirements of [Article 15(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1d "Article 15 GDPR"). The controller either has to state the actual period or name the particular events (like the conclusion of a contract) that influence it.

The DPA issued a reprimand to the controller, [Article 58(2)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2b "Article 58 GDPR").

## Comment

Notably, the DPA's decision derives the right to a copy only from [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR"), while other DPAs have held that [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR") only applies to the meta information and that [Article 15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3 "Article 15 GDPR") is a separate right (also see [OLG München - 3 U 2906/20](/index.php?title=OLG_M%C3%BCnchen_-_3_U_2906/20 "OLG München - 3 U 2906/20")).
