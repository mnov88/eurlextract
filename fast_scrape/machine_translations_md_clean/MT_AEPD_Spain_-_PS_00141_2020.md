## English Summary

### Facts

The complainants complained that illegal recordings of witness statements were recorded by a lawyer in a corruption case. These recordings were used on the website of Asociación de Víctimas por Arbitrariedades Judiciales (hereafter JAVA).

Additionally, upon accessing the website, the Spanish DPA found that several Google Analytics cookies were dropped without any consent from the user. There was also a cookie banner when accessing the website with a link to the privacy policy. Clicking on this linked the user to JAVA's privacy policy where information on cookies was provided. However, there was no second layer on the cookie banner enabling the user to refuse to consent to all cookies.

### Dispute

Is publishing illegal recordings of a witness on a website an infringement of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR?

Is placing cookies without consent when visiting a webpage and not having a "refusal all" button on the cookie banner an infringement of Article 22(2) LSSI?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) held that JAVA infringed Article 6(1)(a) by publishing recordings obtained illegally and, therefore, without consent. This infringement lead to the DPA imposing a fine of € 5000 on JAVA.

In relation to the cookie policy, the Spanish DPA held that the wording of the cookie banner "This website uses cookies so that you have the best user experience " lead to confusion as the message lacked clarity. The DPA also held that the fact that visiting the website lead to (unnecessary) Google Analytics cookies being placed without the user's consent was an infringement of Article 22(2) of the Spanish national law on the Information Society and eCommerce (LSSI). Additionally, the DPA held that the absence of a "Refuse all" button in the cookie banner was also a violation of Article 22(2) LSSI. For these violations of LSSI, the Spanish DPA imposed an additional fine of € 3000 on JAVA.

The Spanish DPA therefore imposed a total fine of € 8000 on JAVA.
