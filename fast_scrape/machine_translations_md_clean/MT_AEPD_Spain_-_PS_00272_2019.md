The claimant filed a complaint with the AEPD against the defendant for installing surveillance cameras on the building facade which are directed at common and transit areas, without any authorization from the owners’ cooperative. Moreover, the information poster installed next the surveillance cameras does not procedure for sufficient information regarding the controller of the processing. It is acknowledged that the surveillance cameras processe personal data as there are recording clear images of natural persons.

### Dispute

The AEPD had to examine whether the recording of personal data carried through the video surveillance system is in accordance with the GDPR. Especially, if the installation of surveillance camera is contrary to the data minimisation principle, under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

### Holding

Also, it specified that the installation of a video surveillance system which may record partially the public area security could be lawful only it is indispensable for the achievement of security purposes or if it is impossible to avoid it due to the location of the cameras to the extent that the minimum space for that purpose is collected. Finally, the AEPD also mentioned that, pursuant to Articles 12 and 13 GDPR, the information related to the processing has to be sufficiently visible, and must include he controller’s identity, the purposes of the processing and the possibility of exercising the rights provided under the GDPR.

Then, in the situation based on the claim, the APED hold that the controller should have informed the President of the owners’ cooperative and that the recording must not affect common areas. Also, it must have an approved sign, indicating the controller's identity and an effective address to which it can be directed.

Therefore, by having installed some surveillance cameras without any appropriate safeguard, the controller infringed Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. In addition, the controller infringed Article 12 because he prevented the data subject to effectively exercised theirs rights under Articles 15 to 22 GDPR.
