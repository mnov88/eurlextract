## English Summary

### Facts

On 23 June 2023, a data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) requesting sanctioning proceedings against Mouro Producciones, S.R.L. (the controller). The controller, which hosted concerts and other events, required that parents or guardians provide a copy for their national identity cards (IDs) as well as of the minors’ IDs in order to gain entry.

The AEPD noted that the controller’s policy discussing its processing of minors’ data was out of date, making reference to a national law that had since been replaced. The policy did not specify why copies of IDs were necessary or how the copies would be processed beyond admission to the venue. It also did not state how long the data would be retained by the controller.

In its reply brief, the controller argued that it was necessary to verify the minors’ and their companions’ IDs in order to confirm their ages and to ensure compliance with Law 3/2017 the Espectáculos Públicos y Actividaded Recreativas de Cantabria. The national/regional law limits minors’ ability to enter certain types of venues, including party rooms, discos, and dance rooms, and requires that establishments deny entry to anyone who does not verify their age with documentation. The law makes exceptions where the establishment authorises special sessions for minors or where minors under the age of 16 are accompanied by adults and the activity of the establishment is compatible with protecting minors’ moral and physical integrity.

### Holding

The AEPD found that the controller likely violated Articles 5(1)(c) and 13 GDPR and recommended a €20,000 fine.

First, the AEPD considered that the controller failed to meet data minimisation standards pursuant to [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"). The AEPD took into consideration Recital 39 GDPR’s instruction that personal data should only be processed if the purpose could not be reasonably achieved by other means. While Law 3/2017 required age verification of minors and their guardians, the controller went a step further by requiring a copy of the IDs. This collection of a complete and unredacted photocopy of IDs resulted in more processing than necessary and thus likely violated [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR").

Second, the AEPD found that the controller likely violated Article 13 GPPR. The lack of information concerning the processing or storage period provided in the disclosure policy, as well as its being out of date, indicated that the controller failed to meet its information obligations. The AEPD noted that this resulted in other shortcomings for data subjects’ ability to exercise their rights, as the policy’s lack of sufficient information prevented data subjects from exercising their rights pursuant to [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR").

Given these likely violations, the AEPD resolved to initiate sanction proceedings against the controller and recommended a sanction of €20,000. Pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €12,000.

LOPDGDD, is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a

                                  Previous issues

In the present case, the processing of personal data by
part of MOURO PRODUCCIONES, S.R.L. in its business activity, as

established in article 4.2 of the RGPD:

"processing": any operation or set of operations performed on data
personal data or sets of personal data, whether through procedures
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring,
conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,

communication by transmission, broadcast or any other form of enabling
access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction;

MOURO PRODUCTIONS, S.R.L. carries out this activity in its capacity as
responsible for the treatment, given that it is the one who determines the purposes and means of such

activity, under article 4.7 of the GDPR:

"responsible for the treatment" or "responsible": the natural or legal person, authority
public, service or other body that, alone or together with others, determines the purposes and
means of treatment; whether Union or Member State law
determines the purposes and means of the treatment, the person responsible for the treatment or the

                                 Unfulfilled obligation

The known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to Mouro
Productions, regulated in article 5.1.c) of the RGPD and other violation of article 13
of the GDPR.

                                           III
                               Article 5.1 c) of the GDPR

 Article 5 of the GDPR “Principles relating to processing” refers to the principle of

data minimization in letter c) of section 1 in the following terms:

“The personal data will be:

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/15

 c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed (“data minimization”)”.

This article states that personal data will be “adequate,
relevant and limited to the need” for which they were collected, in such a way
that, if the objective pursued can be achieved without excessive treatment of
data, this is how it should be done.

In turn, recital 39 of the GDPR indicates that: “Personal data must only be
processed if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be achieved by others
media." Therefore, only data that is “adequate,
relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are obtained or processed.”

The categories of data selected for processing must be the
strictly necessary to achieve the stated objective and the person responsible for the
processing must strictly limit data collection to that information that
is directly related to the specific goal that is intended to be achieved.

In this case, the company requests that the “access to access document” be completed.

allow the entry of minors to concerts managed by it. In addition to
This completed authorization requires the presentation of a photocopy of the ID of the
authorizing parent or guardian who will remain in the possession of the company.

In the written response to the transfer of the claim, the company states that
the reason why the minor's companion is requested to provide a copy of the
DNI, it is because it is necessary to carry out, before authorizing access to the premises, a
correct identification of the person to comply with current regulations.

Article 40 “Protection of childhood and adolescence” of Law 3/2017, of 5
April, of Public Entertainment and Recreational Activities of Cantabria establishes, in
its section 2.:

2. The following limitations on access and permanence are established in the
public establishments and portable or removable facilities, where

of drug dependence.

2. That the activity that is going to take place in the party rooms, dance halls,
pubs, whiskey shops and similar venues is compatible with moral and physical integrity

                                 Sanction proposal

In order to determine the administrative fine to impose, the following must be observed:
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, provisions that indicate:

"1. Each supervisory authority will ensure that the imposition of fines
administrative sanctions under this article for violations of this

effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, as an additional or substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administrative and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

 a) the nature, severity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the

nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
have suffered;
b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) any measure taken by the person responsible or in charge of the treatment to

alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;
d) the degree of responsibility of the person responsible or in charge of the treatment,
taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have been implemented under

e) any previous infringement committed by the controller or processor;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the
infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;

particular whether the controller or processor notified the infringement and, if so, in what
extent;

 i) when the measures indicated in Article 58, paragraph 2, have been ordered
previously against the person responsible or the person in charge in question in relation to the
same matter, compliance with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to mechanisms of
certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,

such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct or
indirectly, through infringement.”

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
“Sanctions and corrective measures” provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the Regulation

h) The submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
"There are disputes between those and any interested party."

In this case, given the possible violation of articles 5.1 c) and 13 of the RGPD,
the imposition of a fine would be appropriate, in addition to the adoption of measures, in its
case.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate

and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of article 83.1 of the RGPD. Thus
considers, in advance, the condition of the claimed part of small
company, and with a business volume of 4,992,744 euros in 2022.

In accordance with the indicated precepts, in accordance with the evidence that

currently has an agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure and
without prejudice to what results from the instruction of the procedure, for the purposes of setting the
amount of the sanctions to be imposed in the present case, it is considered that it is appropriate

       data that is not necessary for the purpose for which it was processed, and may

       It can be understood that this occurs when there is no proper information about the
       rights that assist those affected by the data processing that is going to
