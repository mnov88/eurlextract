## English Summary

### Facts

The decision revolved around a motivational document of a family created by a care provider in light of child protection services. The document labels the family as potentially alarming because of mental well-being of the child and the parents. The mother, the data subject in this case, vehemently disagrees with both the content and the creation process of the document and wants it deleted in its entirety based on [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"). The controller denied this request of erasure.

### Holding

The DPA dismissed the complaint on the basis of article 95, §1, 3° WOG (Law establishing the DPA). The DPA established that the right to erasure of [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") has been exercised correctly. However, this right is not aimed at being able to contest the correctness of a document containing personal findings and assessments of care providers regarding the mental well-being of both the child and the mother within their mutual relationship. The document contained the individual opinion of the care provider, which falls within their legal tasks regarding child protection services. As such, the DPA held that the document cannot be erased based on [Article 17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR").

Adding to this, the DPA held that [Article 17(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#3 "Article 17 GDPR") established that the right to erasure does not apply for reasons of public interest in the field of public health in according with [Article 9(2)(h)GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2h "Article 9 GDPR"). The DPA concluded that it is not up to the DPA to determine the correctness of the information in the document and thus order the fulfillment of the request of erasure.

The complainant: Mrs X, hereinafter referred to as “the complainant”; .

                                                                                                .

The controllers: Y, hereinafter “controller”; Decision 42/2023 - 2/5

I. Factual Procedure

 1. On 25 February 2023, the complainant submitted a complaint to the Data Protection Authority
       against controller.

 2. The object of the complaint concerns the layout within the framework of integral youth care of

       a motivation document, called M-document, drawn up by the

       controller as a result of the alarming situation that would have been identified

       within the complainant's family and where the child was referred to as a KOPP child, being
       a child of parents with mental health problems. The complainant strongly disagrees with the

       content of the M-document, as well as the way in which this document was created

       and has requested the controller to review this document in its entirety

       delete it, especially since the controller has the M document

       transferred to the Support Center for Youth Care (OCJ) according to the complainant

       also has incorrect information. This request for complete removal of the

       M document is not followed up by the controller.

 3. On March 20, 2023, the complaint will be declared admissible by the First Line Service on the grounds

       of the articles 58 and 60 WOG and the complaint is transferred on the basis of art. 62, § 1 WOG

       to the dispute room.

II. Motivation

 4. On the basis of the elements in the file known to the Litigation Chamber, and on the basis of

       the powers assigned to it by the legislator on the basis of Article 95, §1 WOG,

       the Litigation Chamber decides on the further follow-up of the file; in this case the

       Disputes Chamber about the dismissal of the complaint in accordance with Article 95, §1,3 ° WOG,

       on the basis of the following justification.

 5. When a complaint is dismissed, the Disputes Chamber makes its decision
       step-by-step motivation and:

           - pronounce a technical dismissal if the file is not or not sufficient

               contains elements that could lead to a conviction, or if there are not enough

               there is a prospect of a conviction for a technical obstacle, as a result of which

               she cannot come to a decision;

1Court of Appeal Brussels, Sectie Marktenhof, 19 Chamber A, Chamber for Market Affairs, judgment 2020/AR/329, 2 September 2020, p. 18. Decision 42/2023 - 3/5

            - or declare a policy dismissal, if despite the presence of elements

                which may lead to a sanction, the continuation of the investigation of the file

                seems inappropriate in light of the priorities of the

                Data Protection Authority, as specified and explained in the
                                                     2
                dismissal policy of the Litigation Chamber .

 6. In the event that more than one ground is dismissed, the grounds for dismissal (resp.
       technical dismissal and policy dismissal) must be dealt with in order of importance. 3

 7. In the present file, the Disputes Chamber proceeds to a technical dismissal of

       the complaint. The following motive is at the basis of the decision of the Disputes Chamber why

       it considers it undesirable to follow up on the file and therefore decides not to

       to proceed to, inter alia, a treatment on the merits.

 8. The Disputes Chamber determines that the right to erasure of data (Article 17 GDPR) becomes

       exercised in relation to the relevant M document issued by the

       controller has been drawn up regarding the minor son of the

       complainer. In concrete terms, the exercise of the right to erasure is aimed at

       document submitted by the controller to the

       Support Center for Youth Care (OCJ), to be deleted in its entirety, because this document

       according to the complainant, contained completely incorrect information.

 9. In this context, the Disputes Chamber rules that this request from the complainant is beyond its scope

       is subject to the right to erasure of Article 17 GDPR. This right is not aimed at the

       accuracy of an M-document containing personal findings and assessments of

       care providers contains in this case the mental well-being of both the child and the child
       the mother within their mutual relationship. In a context like the

       the present in which an M document by definition contains the individual opinion of the person concerned

       helper is worded about those who are the object of help, this within

       the legally assigned tasks with regard to integral youth care, cannot become the M-document

       deleted pursuant to Article 17.1 GDPR in the absence of application of the provisions in this provision

       cases mentioned.

2 In this context, the Litigation Chamber refers to its dismissal policy as explained in detail on the website of the GBA:
https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/publications/sepotbeleid-van-de-geschillenkamer.pdf
3Ibid.

4Article 17.1. AVG. The data subject has the right of the controller to erasure without undue delay
to obtain personal data concerning him and the controller is obliged to process personal data without
erase unreasonable delay where one of the following applies: a) the personal data is no longer
necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;
(b) the data subject withdraws consent subject to the processing pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2);
is based on, and there is no other legal basis for the processing;

c) the data subject objects to the processing in accordance with Article 21(1) and there are no overriding compelling
legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing in accordance with Article 21,
paragraph 2; Decision 42/2023 - 4/5

 10. In addition to this, the Disputes Chamber notes that Article 17.3 GDPR also stipulates that

       the right to data erasure cannot be exercised for reasons of public interest

       in the field of public health in accordance with Article 9.2 h) GDPR, when the

       processing is necessary for, among other things, the provision of social services.

 11. The degree of accuracy of the information reported by the controller

       evaluation of mental well-being, as recorded in an M-document, cannot be

       assessed by the Disputes Chamber, which makes it impossible for it to,

       following the exercise of the right of rectification by the complainant, to order

       the controller to delete the M document. After all, it's not coming

       to the Dispute Chamber to verify the veracity of mental well-being evaluations

       and, if necessary, link it to a data erasure order.

III. Publication of the decision

 12. Given the importance of transparency with regard to decision-making by the

       Litigation Chamber, this decision will be published on the website of the

       Data Protection Authority. However, it is not necessary for the

       identification data of the parties are disclosed directly.

 13. In accordance with its dismissal policy, the Disputes Chamber will make the decision to the

       transfer identified data controllers. The Disputes Chamber has

       decided to officially notify its dismissal decisions

       defendants. However, the Litigation Chamber will waive such notification when the

       the complainant has requested anonymity with respect to the defendant's notification of

       the decision to the defendant, even if pseudonymised, nevertheless

d) the personal data have been processed unlawfully;
e) the personal data must be erased in order to comply with a law laid down in Union or Member State law

legal obligation incumbent on the controller;
f) the personal data have been collected in connection with the offer of information society services referred to in
Article 8(1).
