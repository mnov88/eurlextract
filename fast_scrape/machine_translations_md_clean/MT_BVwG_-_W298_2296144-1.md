## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a credit information agency that collects information from different sources to calculate an individual’s creditworthiness. This information is accessed by third parties. The controller contractually obliges its contractual partners (such as debt collection agencies) to inform it (as a credit information agency) about payment defaults of data subjects.

The debt collection agency informed the data subject of the transfer of their data to the controller in 2020, and since then, the controller stored entries on the payment history data of the data subject. The payments were later settled and the entries reflected this. However, the controller refused to delete them when the data subject requested their erasure. The data subject argued that their economic progress was impaired as a result, and brought a complaint to the DPA. The controller argued that the processed data was still necessary for credit checking purposes.

The DPA upheld the complaint in June 2024, and stated that the controller had violated the data subject’s right to erasure. Furthermore, the controller was not permitted to store payment history data beyond its settlement, and was required to delete the entries. According to the DPA, further processing of the data was unnecessary, because the claims had already been settled in full.

The controller appealed the decision to the Federal Administrative Court, arguing that this payment history was necessary to calculate reliable information about an individual’s creditworthiness.

### Holding

The Court first stated that the controller could only rely on legitimate interests ([Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR")) as a valid legal basis for processing, meaning national law (such as Section 152 of the Industrial Code) or other legal bases under [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") were not valid.

The Court then examined the case law on balancing the legal interests of data subjects and credit information agencies. Jurisprudence of the Court and the Administrative Court have consistently held that historical payment information is essential to predict the future payment behaviour of a (potential) debtor. However, this data becomes less meaningful with time, and is one of the aspects that must be taken into account in the assessment.

The Court referenced CJEU case law ([SCHUFA](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C%E2%80%9126/22_and_C%E2%80%9164/22_-_SCHUFA_Holding_and_Others_\(Discharge_from_remaining_debts\)_\(Joined_Cases\) "CJEU - C‑26/22 and C‑64/22 - SCHUFA Holding and Others (Discharge from remaining debts) (Joined Cases)") and [Google Spain](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C%E2%80%91131/12_-_Google_Spain "CJEU - C‑131/12 - Google Spain")) to state that the processing of insolvency data by a credit information agency is a serious interference with the data subject’s fundamental rights. This data is sensitive, and the assessment of creditworthiness may cause significant harms to the data subject. The Court applied the reasoning of the [SCHUFA](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C%E2%80%9126/22_and_C%E2%80%9164/22_-_SCHUFA_Holding_and_Others_\(Discharge_from_remaining_debts\)_\(Joined_Cases\) "CJEU - C‑26/22 and C‑64/22 - SCHUFA Holding and Others (Discharge from remaining debts) (Joined Cases)") case, arguing that the processing of payment history data originating in private sources have similar consequences. Similarly, the conclusion that retaining decisions on debt discharges beyond their public availability is unlawful [(Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR")) also applies to this case.

In terms of the right to erasure, the Court concluded that the data subject could not rely on this right under [Article 17(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1d "Article 17 GDPR"). This is because the controller had collected the data lawfully through a legally admissible private sector agreement. Nonetheless, the Court stated that the data subject has the right to erasure under [Article 17(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1a "Article 17 GDPR"), where data is erased when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected or processed. This is also in accordance with the principles of purpose limitation [(Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR")), data minimisation ([Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR")) and storage limitation ([Article 5(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR")). The Court took into account the [SCHUFA](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C%E2%80%9126/22_and_C%E2%80%9164/22_-_SCHUFA_Holding_and_Others_\(Discharge_from_remaining_debts\)_\(Joined_Cases\) "CJEU - C‑26/22 and C‑64/22 - SCHUFA Holding and Others (Discharge from remaining debts) (Joined Cases)") case and the Austrian Insolvency Code to set a limit of one year for storing creditworthiness data related to settled debt.

The Court upheld the decision by the DPA, and ordered the controller to delete the payment history data stored.

Text

Reasons for the Decision:

I. Procedural Procedure: Roman one. Procedural Procedure:

1. XXXX (in the proceedings before the Data Protection Authority, "complainant," in the above-mentioned proceedings, "co-participating party") filed a data protection complaint with the Data Protection Authority (hereinafter "respondent authority") on XXXX 2023, in which he alleged, in summary, a violation of his right to erasure by XXXX (in the proceedings before the respondent authority, "respondent," in the above-mentioned proceedings, "appellant"). The complainant had stored entries (payment history data) in the amount of €XXXX relating to the co-participating party, which had already been settled. The entries also indicated that the transaction had been completed, but the complainant refused to delete the entries. There was no need for further storage. However, the co-participating party was thereby adversely affected in its economic development. 1. roman 40 (in the proceedings before the Data Protection Authority, the "complainant"; in the above proceedings, the "co-participating party") filed a data protection complaint with the Data Protection Authority (hereinafter, the "competent authority") on roman 40, 2023, alleging a violation of the right to erasure by roman 40 (in the proceedings before the competent authority, the "respondent"; in the above proceedings, the "appellant"). The complainant had stored entries (payment history data) in the amount of €roman 40 relating to the co-participating party, which had already been settled. The entries also indicated that the transaction had been successfully completed, but the complainant refused to delete the entries. There was no need for further storage. However, the co-participating party was thereby adversely affected in its economic development.

2. The complainant responded on XXXX 2023, essentially stating that it was true that it continued to process four positively settled payment experiences in its identity and creditworthiness database, in its view lawfully, in its data set relating to the co-participating party. Deletion was therefore out of the question because the processed data was still required for the purpose of the credit check. This concerned claims from 2021 and 2023, which had been positively settled (=paid). However, these claims had remained outstanding for nine to 12 months in some cases, and in one case for over 6.5 years. The accuracy of the data and the associated claims was undisputed. The co-participating party had been informed by the creditors in the corresponding reminder letters that they would report their respective claims to the complainant in the event of non-timely payment. The complainant responded on 40 Roman 2023, essentially stating that it was true that it continued to process four positively settled payment experiences in its identity and creditworthiness database, in its view legally, in its data set relating to the co-participating party. Deletion was therefore out of the question because the processed data was still required for the purpose of the credit check. This concerned claims from 2021 and 2023, which had been positively settled (=paid). However, these claims had remained outstanding for nine to 12 months in some cases, and in one case for over 6.5 years. The accuracy of the data and the associated claims was undisputed. The co-participating party had been informed by the creditors in the corresponding reminder letters that they would report their respective claims to the complainant in the event of non-timely payment.

3. In a submission dated XXXX 2023, the complainant submitted a sample reminder letter from a (operating) debt collection agency and a reminder letter from another debt collection agency, and further stated that XXXX and XXXX (formerly XXXX) had provided the co-participating party with GDPR-compliant data protection information regarding the potential disclosure of data to the complainant. 3. In a submission dated roman 40 2023, the complainant submitted a sample reminder letter from a (operating) debt collection agency and a reminder letter from another debt collection agency, and further stated that roman 40 and roman 40 (formerly roman 40) had provided the co-participating party with GDPR-compliant data protection information regarding the potential disclosure of data to the complainant.

4. In a written submission dated XXXX 2024, the complainant supplemented her submissions to the effect that, in her view, the subject matter of the proceedings was not comparable with the ECJ decision of 7 December 2023 in Joined Cases C-26/22 and C-64/22 (SCHUFA Holding/Residual Debt Relief) on discharge of residual debt because the data of the co-participating party did not come from the edict file or any other public file, but from a private source.4. In a written submission dated Roman 40, 2024, the complainant supplemented its submissions by stating that, in its view, the subject matter of the proceedings was not comparable with the ECJ's decision of December 7, 2023, in joined cases C-26/22 and C-64/22 (SCHUFA Holding/Residual Debt Relief) on residual debt relief because the data of the co-participating party did not come from the edict file or any other public file, but from a private source.

5. By decision of XXXX, 2024, the respondent authority upheld the data protection complaint due to a violation of the right to erasure and ruled that the complainant had stored payment experience data - specifically, claims in the amount of EUR XXXX; EUR XXXX; EUR XXXX (presumably meaning EUR XXXX ) and EUR XXXX - beyond the date of positive settlement on XXXX 2023, XXXX 2021, XXXX 2021 and XXXX 2021 and had not deleted them from its database (judgment point I.). The complainant was ordered to delete the aforementioned entries completely within a period of two weeks, otherwise execution would be punished (judgment point II.). Otherwise the complaint was dismissed (judgment point III.).5. By decision of roman 40 2024 the authority concerned upheld the data protection complaint due to the violation of the right to erasure and stated that the complainant had processed payment experience data - specifically claims in the amount of EUR roman 40 ; EUR roman 40 ; EUR Roman 40 (presumably meaning EUR Roman 40) and EUR Roman 40 - beyond the date of positive settlement on Roman 40 2023, Roman 40 2021, Roman 40 2021, and Roman 40 2021 and had not deleted them from its database (ruling point Roman 1). The complainant was ordered to completely delete the aforementioned entries within a period of two weeks, failing which the court would enforce the decision (ruling point Roman 2). The remainder of the appeal was dismissed (ruling point Roman 3).

In its justification, the authority in question essentially stated that the complainant's processing of the payment history data was unnecessary, as the claims had already been fully repaid in January 2023 and January and February 2021, and there was nothing to justify further processing.

6. On XXXX 2024, the appellant filed an appeal against points I and II of the decision, essentially arguing that the authority in question held the incorrect legal opinion that the appellant was obligated to delete the payment history data relating to the co-participating party from the time the respective claim was positively settled. The processing of payment history data due to simple payment defaults – as opposed to payment history data relating to insolvency – is necessary in order to calculate truthful, reliable, and robust information about a person's creditworthiness and thus to be able to offer its services as a credit information agency pursuant to Section 152 of the Trade Regulation Act 1994. 6. On Roman 40 2024, the appellant filed an appeal against points I and II of the decision. and Roman II of the decision, essentially stating that the respondent authority took the incorrect legal view that the complainant was obligated to delete the payment history data relating to the co-participating party from the time the respective claim was positively settled. The processing of payment history data due to simple payment defaults – as opposed to payment history data relating to insolvency – is necessary in order to calculate truthful, reliable, and robust information about a person's creditworthiness and thus to be able to offer its services as a credit information agency pursuant to Section 152 of the Trade Regulation Act 1994.

7. With the file submission dated XXXX 2024, the respondent authority submitted the administrative act in question to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision. 7. With the file submission dated Roman 40 2024, the respondent authority submitted the administrative act in question to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision.

Fundamental right to data protection

Section 1. (1) Everyone has the right to the confidentiality of personal data concerning him or her, in particular with regard to respect for his or her private and family life, provided there is a legitimate interest in doing so. The existence of such an interest is excluded if data cannot be subject to a claim of confidentiality due to their general availability or their lack of traceability to the data subject. Paragraph 1: (1) Everyone has the right to confidentiality of personal data concerning them, in particular with regard to respect for their private and family life, provided there is a legitimate interest in doing so. The existence of such an interest is excluded if data cannot be subject to a claim of confidentiality due to their general availability or their lack of traceability to the data subject.

(2) To the extent that the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the data subject or with their consent, restrictions on the right to confidentiality are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another person; in the case of interventions by a state authority, this restriction is only permissible on the basis of laws that are necessary for the reasons stated in Article 8 (2) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), Federal Law Gazette No. 210/1958. Such laws may only provide for the use of data which, by their nature, are particularly worthy of protection to safeguard important public interests and must, at the same time, establish appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality interests of those affected.

Definitions

Article 4. For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:

1. "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person;

2. “Processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;

7. “Controller” means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;

11. “Consent” of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her;

Principles governing the processing of personal data

Article 5. (1) Personal data must

a) be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (“lawfulness, fairness, transparency”);

b) be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes shall not be considered incompatible with the original purposes (“purpose limitation”) pursuant to Article 89(1);

(c) be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the processing ('data minimization');

(d) be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step shall be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay ('accuracy');

(e) be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed; personal data may be stored for a longer period provided that the personal data are processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1), subject to the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures required by this Regulation to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject ('storage limitation');

(f) be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical and organizational measures (“integrity and confidentiality”);

(2) The controller shall be responsible for compliance with paragraph 1 and shall be able to demonstrate compliance (“accountability”).Lawfulness of processing

Article 6. (1) Processing is only lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:

a) The data subject has given consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for one or more specific purposes;

b) Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;

c) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;

d) Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;

e) Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;

(f) processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.

(2) Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for the purpose of complying with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by specifying more precisely specific processing requirements and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, including for other specific processing situations as referred to in Chapter IX. (2) Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for the purpose of complying with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by specifying more precisely specific processing requirements and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, including for other specific processing situations as referred to in Chapter IX.

(3) The legal basis for the processing operations referred to in points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be:

(a) Union law; or

(b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.

The purpose of the processing must be specified in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, must be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions adapting the application of the rules of this Regulation, inter alia, provisions on the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller, the types of data processed, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which and for which purposes the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitation, the storage period and the processing operations and procedures that may be used, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, such as those for other specific processing situations referred to in Chapter IX. Union or Member State law must pursue an objective in the public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate purpose pursued. The purpose of the processing must be specified in that legal basis or, with regard to the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation, including provisions on the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller, the types of data processed, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which and for what purposes the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitation, the storage period, and the processing operations and procedures that may be used, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, such as those for other specific processing situations pursuant to Chapter IX of this Regulation. Union or Member State law must pursue an objective in the public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate purpose pursued.

(4) Where processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected is not based on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which, in a democratic society, constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to determine whether processing for another purpose is compatible with that for which the personal data were initially collected, take into account, inter alia,

a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data were collected and the purposes of the intended further processing;

b) the context in which the personal data were collected, in particular as regards the relationship between the data subjects and the controller;

c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed pursuant to Article 9 or whether personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses pursuant to Article 10 are processed;

d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for the data subjects;

e) the Existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymization.

Article 17 reads:

Right to erasure ('right to be forgotten')

(1) The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall be obliged to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:

a) The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.

...

c) The data subject objects to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to processing pursuant to Article 21(2).

d) The personal data have been unlawfully processed.

...“

The relevant provision of the Federal Act on Insolvency Proceedings (Insolvency Code – IO) reads as follows:

Insolvency File

Section 256. (1) The edict file shall contain the data that must be made public under this Federal Act (insolvency file).

(2) Access to the insolvency file shall no longer be granted if one year has passed since:

1. the termination of the insolvency proceedings pursuant to Sections 123a, 123b, and 139,

2. the expiration of the payment period stipulated in the restructuring plan if its fulfillment is not monitored,

3. the termination or discontinuation of monitoring of the restructuring plan,

4. the expiration of the payment period stipulated in the payment plan Payment deadline or

5. the premature suspension or termination of the recovery proceedings.

(3) At the debtor's request, access to the insolvency file shall no longer be granted if the legally confirmed restructuring plan or payment plan has been fulfilled. The debtor must provide documentary evidence of fulfillment. The court may appoint an expert to examine fulfillment, whose costs shall be borne by the debtor. The court shall decide on access by final order.

(4) Access to the entries of insolvency proceedings not opened due to a lack of assets to cover costs or due to lack of assets pursuant to Section 68 shall no longer be granted after three years from the date of entry.

The relevant provision of the Federal Act on the Trade Code 1994 (GewO) reads as follows: follows:

Credit Information Agencies

Section 152 (1) Businesses authorized to operate credit information agencies are not authorized to provide information about private circumstances that are unrelated to creditworthiness.Section 152 (1) Businesses authorized to operate credit information agencies are not authorized to provide information about private circumstances that are unrelated to creditworthiness.

(2) The traders referred to in paragraph 1 are obligated to retain their business correspondence and business records for seven years. The seven-year period begins at the end of the calendar year in which the correspondence took place or the last entry was made in the business records. In the event of termination of the trade license, the correspondence and business records must be destroyed, even if the seven-year period has not yet expired.

3.3.2. Applied to the present case, this means the following:

For the purposes of the present proceedings, the complainant is processing data on four negative payment experiences in the amount of EUR XXXX (2016-2023); (respectively, opened and closed claims); EUR XXXX (2020-2021); EUR XXXX (2020-2021) and EUR XXXX (2020-2021) from data sources XXXX and XXXX, as well as XXXX for the purposes of credit assessment.For the purposes of the present proceedings, the complainant is processing data on four negative payment experiences in the amount of EUR 40 Roman (2016-2023); (respectively, opened and closed claims); EUR 40 Roman (2020-2021); EUR 40 Roman (2020-2021) and EUR 40 Roman (2020-2021) from data sources Roman 40 and Roman 40, as well as Roman 40 for the purposes of credit assessment.

In its 2024 data protection complaint, the co-participating party asserted a violation of its right to erasure pursuant to Article 17 GDPR and requested the removal of the payment history data identified under 1.7 because it was no longer relevant for assessing creditworthiness and the processing was therefore unlawful. The complainant rejected the co-participating party's request for erasure. In its 2024 data protection complaint, the co-participating party asserted a violation of its right to erasure pursuant to Article 17 GDPR and requested the removal of the payment history data identified under 1.7 because it was no longer relevant for assessing creditworthiness and the processing was therefore unlawful. The complainant rejected the co-participating party's request for erasure.

The storage of payment history data, such as the already paid claims of various debt collection agencies against the co-participating party in this case, constitutes the processing of personal data within the meaning of Article 4(2) GDPR. The storage of payment history data, such as the already paid claims of various debt collection agencies against the co-participating party in this case, constitutes the processing of personal data within the meaning of Article 4(2) GDPR.

The admissible complaint is unfounded.

3.3.3. The business of credit reporting agencies

3.3.3.4. The complainant operates the business of credit reporting agencies in accordance with Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO). The duties of traders within the meaning of Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) include providing information on the creditworthiness of companies and private individuals to third parties. The purpose of these traders is to provide lenders with meaningful information about existing or potential borrowers, particularly regarding the manner in which they have settled their debts to date (Riesz in Ennöckl/Raschauer/Wessely, GewO § 152 Rz 2). This is intended to enable lenders to determine the probability that the lender will ultimately be satisfied with their claim and, if necessary, to predict the associated difficulties (Wendehorst, What is Creditworthiness? On the Concept of "Creditworthiness" in § 7 VKrG, in Blaschek/Habersberger (eds.), Eines Kredites würdig? (2011) 22). A tendency toward breach of contract—such as a lack of financial self-control or habitual delaying of payments to the point of enforcement—can be predicted primarily from past financial conduct. Relevant in this regard is past breach of contract, which may have manifested itself in simple default in payment, but also in legal proceedings, including enforcement actions or even the opening of insolvency proceedings (ibid. 23; see also Heinrich, Bonitätsprüfung im Verbraucherkreditrecht (Vienna 2014) 89 f). 3.3.3.4. The complainant operates as a credit information agency pursuant to Section 152 of the Trade Regulation Act (GewO). The duties of traders within the meaning of Section 152 of the Trade Regulation Act include providing information on the creditworthiness of companies and private individuals to third parties. The purpose of these traders is to provide lenders with meaningful information about existing or potential borrowers, in particular about the nature and manner of their previous debt repayment (Riesz in Ennöckl/Raschauer/Wessely, Trade Regulation Act, Section 152, para. 2). This is intended to enable lenders to determine the probability that the lender will ultimately be satisfied with their claim and, if necessary, to predict the associated difficulties (Wendehorst, What is Creditworthiness? On the Concept of "Creditworthiness" in Paragraph 7, VKrG, in Blaschek/Habersberger (eds.), Worthy of a Credit? (2011) 22). A tendency toward breach of contract—such as a lack of financial self-control or habitual delaying of payments to the point of enforcement—can be predicted primarily from past financial conduct. Relevant in this context is past breach of contract, which may have manifested itself in simple default, but also in legal proceedings, including enforcement actions, or even the opening of insolvency proceedings (ibid. 23; see also Heinrich, Credit Assessment in Consumer Credit Law (Vienna 2014) 89 f.).

In the course of operating the credit reporting business, the complainant processes historical information on the co-participating party's payment defaults in order to make it available to (potential) creditors so that they can determine the risk of potential payment defaults.

This is a specified, clear, and legally recognized purpose (Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act). The data is also correct and complete. It is also fundamentally necessary and suitable for making a forecast of future payment behavior (see also ECJ 23 November 2006, Case C-238/05, paragraph 47, regarding systems for the exchange of information between financial institutions). This is a specified, clear, and legally recognized purpose (Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act). The data is also correct and complete. They are also fundamentally necessary and suitable for making a forecast of future payment behavior (see also ECJ 23.11.2006, Case C-238/05, paragraph 47, regarding systems for the exchange of information between financial institutions).

3.3.3.5. Those carrying out the trade pursuant to Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) cannot – as in the present case – rely on a legal basis within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR for the necessary data processing.

3.3.3.5. Those carrying out the trade pursuant to Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) cannot – as in the present case – rely on a legal basis within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR for the necessary data processing. Restrictions on the fundamental right to data protection are also permissible under laws that are necessary for the reasons stated in Article 8 (2) of the ECHR and that regulate, with sufficient precision and in a manner that is predictable for everyone, the conditions under which the collection or use of personal data is permitted for the performance of specific tasks. Therefore, the legislature must also provide for a material-specific regulation within the scope of the GDPR, in the sense that the cases of permissible interference with the fundamental right to data protection are specified and limited (VfGH 23.06.2014, G 90/2013 \[Identification Processing\]). The reservation of intervention is therefore based on the fact that the legislature must define, specify and limit the conditions and limits of permissible interventions in the right to data protection in the respective substantive law, while at the same time providing appropriate guarantees for the protection of the confidentiality interests of those affected (VwGH 10.12.2018, Ra 2018/12/0060 \[Unredacted certificates\]; cf. also VwGH 14.11.2013, 2012/17/0048 \[Disclosure of customer data to the FMA\]; VfGH 09.12.2008, B 1944/07 \[Section Control II\]; cf. Thiele/Wagner, Practical Commentary on the Data Protection Act \[DSG\] § 1, margin numbers 55; 77). Restrictions on the fundamental right to data protection are also permissible on the basis of laws that arise from the reasons set out in Article 8, paragraph 2, ECHR and which regulate, with sufficient precision and in a manner that is predictable for everyone, the conditions under which the collection or use of personal data is permitted for the performance of specific tasks. The legislature must therefore also provide for a material-specific regulation within the scope of the GDPR, in the sense that the cases of permissible interference with the fundamental right to data protection are specified and limited (VfGH 23.06.2014, G 90/2013 \[Identification Processing\]). The reservation of intervention is therefore based on the fact that the legislature must define, specify and – while at the same time providing appropriate guarantees for the protection of the confidentiality interests of those affected – limit the conditions and limits of permissible interventions in the right to data protection in the respective substantive law (VwGH 10.12.2018, Ra 2018/12/0060 \[unredacted certificates\]; see also VwGH 14.11.2013, 2012/17/0048 \[disclosure of customer data to the FMA\]; VfGH 09.12.2008, B 1944/07 \[Section Control II\]; see Thiele/Wagner, Practical Commentary on the Data Protection Act \[DSG\] Paragraph one, paras. 55; 77).

The second sentence of Recital 41 of the GDPR also states that a corresponding legal basis must be clear and precise, and its application should be foreseeable for the data subject in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (see Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation, Article 6 GDPR).

Section 152 of the Trade Regulation Act (Gewerbeordnung) is not a legal basis for data processing. Section 152 of the Trade Regulation Act (Gewerbeordnung) is not a legal basis for data processing.

3.3.3.6. The legality of the processing of personal data at issue in these proceedings must therefore be assessed solely in light of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. According to this provision, the processing of personal data is only lawful if the processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, prevail (see VwGH of February 1, 2024, Ro2020/04/0031). 3.3.3.6. The legality of the processing of personal data at issue in these proceedings must therefore be assessed solely in light of Article 6, paragraph 1, subparagraph 1, letter f, GDPR. According to this provision, the processing of personal data is only lawful if the processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, prevail (see VwGH of February 1, 2024, Ro2020/04/0031).

3.3.4. Previous case law of the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG) and the Administrative Court (VwGH):

In the past – prior to the ECJ's decision in the SCHUFA case, which will be discussed in more detail in section 3.3.5. – the Federal Administrative Court and the Higher Administrative Court have consistently held, regarding the balancing of the legal interests of a data subject and a controller in the exercise of the credit reporting business, that historical payment information is essential for predicting the future payment behavior of a (potential) debtor; the further back it dates and the longer there has been no further payment delays or defaults, the less meaningful it is. The age of the claim or the time at which the final default on the claim was established, the time of any repayments, and the debtor's "good conduct" since then were thus of crucial importance in the balancing exercise.

As a guideline for how long credit data is suitable for assessing the creditworthiness of a (potential) debtor, observation or deletion periods in legal provisions that serve to protect creditors or further define the requirements for an appropriate credit assessment were used. This primarily included Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 26, 2013, on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No. 646/2012 ("Capital Requirements Regulation"), which requires credit institutions, among other things, to evaluate their customers and assess various risks associated with their exposures. For credit or retail exposures to natural persons, credit institutions that are permitted to calculate their risk-weighted exposure amounts using an approach based on internal assessments (Article 143(1) of the Act), must estimate the probability of default (PD) of the exposure, inter alia, on the basis of the long-term average of the annual default rate, in accordance with Article 151(6) in conjunction with Article 180(2)(a) and (e) of the Act; a historical observation period of at least five years must be used for at least one data source, which may also be external. The estimate of the loss given default (LGD) must also generally be based on a period of at least five years, in accordance with Article 151(7) in conjunction with Article 181(2)(c) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CIT). As a guideline for how long credit data is suitable for assessing the creditworthiness of a (potential) debtor, observation or deletion periods in legal provisions that serve to protect creditors or further define the requirements for an appropriate credit assessment were used. This primarily applies to Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 26, 2013, on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No. 646/2012 ("Capital Requirements Regulation"), which requires credit institutions, among other things, to evaluate their customers and assess various risks associated with their exposures. For credit or retail exposures to natural persons, credit institutions that are permitted to calculate their risk-weighted exposure amounts using an internal assessment-based approach (Article 143, paragraph 1, leg cit) must, in accordance with Article 151, paragraph 6, in conjunction with Article 180, paragraph 2, letters a and e, leg cit, estimate the probability of default (PD) of the exposure, among other things, based on long-term averages of the annual default rate; this must be based on a historical observation period of at least five years for at least one data source, which may also be external. The estimate of the loss given default (LGD) to be performed must also, in principle, refer to a period of at least five years, in accordance with Article 151, paragraph 7, in conjunction with Article 181, paragraph 2, letter c, leg cit.

From this, the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG) and the Administrative Court (VwGH) concluded that an observation period of at least five years of past payment defaults indicates the legality of data processing (cf. BVwG of October 30, 2019, W258 2216873-1 maN). The Administrative Court most recently confirmed this legal opinion on May 9, 2023, stating that a shorter storage period would likely convey a distorted picture (VwGH May 9, 2023, Ro 2020/04/0037). From this, the Federal Administrative Court (BVwG) and the Administrative Court concluded that an observation period of at least five years of past payment defaults indicates the legality of data processing (cf. BVwG of October 30, 2019, W258 2216873-1 maN). The Administrative Court most recently confirmed this legal opinion on May 9, 2023, stating that a shorter retention period would likely present a distorted picture (VwGH May 9, 2023, Ro 2020/04/0037).

In its recent case law, the Administrative Court has ruled that, insofar as, in view of the Capital Adequacy Regulation, a storage period of at least five years with regard to the storage of payment experience data in the bank warning list was generally considered lawful, it should be pointed out that, in accordance with Article 1 of the Capital Adequacy Regulation, the Capital Adequacy Regulation regulates the general supervisory requirements for credit institutions with regard to specific areas and therefore does not apply to credit reporting agencies (Administrative Court 01.02.2024 Ro 2020/04/0031).In its recent case law, the Administrative Court has ruled that, insofar as, in view of the Capital Adequacy Regulation, a storage period of at least five years with regard to the storage of payment experience data in the bank warning list was generally considered lawful, it should be pointed out that, in accordance with Article 1 of the Capital Adequacy Regulation, the Capital Adequacy Regulation regulates the general supervisory requirements for credit institutions with regard to specific areas and therefore does not apply to Credit reference agencies apply (VwGH 01.02.2024 Ro 2020/04/0031).

3.3.5. Recent ECJ case law

3.3.5.1. The German Administrative Court of Wiesbaden has submitted a request for a preliminary ruling to the ECJ regarding the interpretation of Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as well as Article 6(1)(1)(f), Article 17(1)(d), Article 40, Article 77(1), and Article 78(1) of the GDPR. The request was based on data processing by SCHUFA, a private credit agency (equivalent to a credit bureau), which had collected and stored information from public registers in its own databases, in particular information on discharges of residual debt, which were valid for a maximum of three years after the expiration of the registration in accordance with the code of conduct drawn up in Germany by the Association of Credit Reporting Agencies and approved by the competent supervisory authority. A previously requested deletion by a data subject was rejected. The data originated from a public insolvency register and were processed beyond the time of deletion from the insolvency register. 3.3.5.1. The German Administrative Court of Wiesbaden has submitted a request for a preliminary ruling to the ECJ regarding the interpretation of Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as well as Article 6, paragraph 1, subparagraph 1, letter f, Article 17, paragraph 1, letter d, Article 40, Article 77, paragraph 1, and Article 78, paragraph 1, of the GDPR. The request was based on data processing by SCHUFA, a private credit agency (equivalent to a credit bureau), which had collected and stored information from public registers in its own databases, in particular information on discharges of residual debt, which were valid for a maximum of three years after the expiration of the registration in accordance with the code of conduct developed in Germany by the Association of Credit Reporting Agencies and approved by the competent supervisory authority. A previously requested deletion by a data subject was rejected. The data originated from a public insolvency register and was processed beyond the time of deletion from the insolvency register.

3.3.5.2. In order to answer the admissible questions referred, insofar as they are relevant to the proceedings here regarding the admissibility of data processing within the framework of a legitimate interest, the ECJ first reiterated its previous case law on the judgment of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others. \[General terms and conditions of use of a social network\] C‑252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 106 and the case-law cited therein, and stated that three cumulative conditions (legitimate interest, necessity, and overriding interest in protecting the data subject) must be met and further stated:

‘(81) Ultimately, it is therefore for the referring court to assess whether, with regard to the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings, the three conditions referred to in paragraph 75 of the present judgment are satisfied; however, the Court may, in response to a request for a preliminary ruling from the referring court, provide guidance useful for that assessment (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 October 2022, Digi, C‑77/21, EU:C:2022:805, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited therein). case-law)." (81) Ultimately, it is therefore for the referring court to assess whether, with regard to the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings, the three conditions referred to in paragraph 75 of the present judgment are met; however, the Court may, upon request from the national court for a preliminary ruling, provide the national court with useful guidance for that assessment (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 October 2022, Digi, C-77/21, EU:C:2022:805, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).

(82) In the present case, as regards the pursuit of a legitimate interest, SCHUFA claims that credit reference agencies process data necessary to assess the creditworthiness of persons or companies in order to be able to make that information available to their contractual partners. This activity not only protects the economic interests of companies wishing to enter into credit-related contracts, but also the determination of creditworthiness and the issuing of Credit reports also form a foundation of the credit system and the functioning of the economy. The activities of credit reporting agencies also help to realize the business wishes of prospective credit-relevant transactions, as the information enables a quick and unbureaucratic review of these transactions.

(83) In this respect, while the processing of personal data such as that at issue in the main proceedings serves the economic interests of SCHUFA, this processing also serves to safeguard the legitimate interest of SCHUFA's contractual partners who wish to conclude credit-relevant contracts with individuals in assessing the creditworthiness of those individuals and thus the socio-economic interests of the credit sector.

(84) With regard to consumer credit agreements, it follows from Article 8 of Directive 2008/48, read in light of recital 28 thereof, that the creditor is obliged, before concluding the credit agreement, to assess the consumer's creditworthiness on the basis of sufficient information, if necessary also on the basis of information from public and private databases. (84) With regard to As regards consumer credit agreements, it is clear from Article 8 of Directive 2008/48, read in the light of recital 28 thereof, that, before concluding the credit agreement, the creditor is obliged to assess the consumer's creditworthiness on the basis of sufficient information, including, where necessary, information from public and private databases.

(85) Furthermore, with regard to consumer credit agreements relating to residential immovable property, it follows from Article 18(1) and Article 21(1) of Directive 2014/17, read in conjunction with recitals 55 and 59 of that directive, that the creditor must carry out a thorough assessment of the consumer's creditworthiness and has access to credit databases, with consultation of such databases being a useful element in that assessment. (85) Furthermore, with regard to consumer credit agreements relating to residential immovable property, Article 18(1) and Article 21A(b)(s)(1) of Directive 2014/17, read in conjunction with recitals 55 and 59 of that directive, apply. that the creditor must carry out a thorough assessment of the consumer's creditworthiness and has access to credit databases, consultation of such databases being a useful element in that assessment.

(86) It should be added that the obligation to assess the creditworthiness of consumers, as provided for in Directives 2008/48 and 2014/17, is intended not only to protect the credit applicant but also, as recital 26 of Directive 2008/48 underlines, to ensure the smooth functioning of the credit system as a whole.

(87) However, the data processing must also be necessary to pursue the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, and the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject must not override that interest. In balancing the respective competing rights and interests, namely those of the controller and the third parties involved, on the one hand, and the data subject, on the other, it is necessary, as set out in paragraph 80 of the present judgment, to take into account, in particular: the reasonable expectations of the data subject, as well as the scope of the processing in question and its impact on that person must be taken into account (see judgment of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others (General terms and conditions of use of a social network), C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 116). (87) However, the data processing must also be necessary to achieve the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, and the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject must not override that interest. In balancing the respective competing rights and interests, that is to say, those of the controller and the third parties involved, on the one hand, and of the data subject, on the other, it is necessary, as set out in paragraph 80 of the present judgment, to take into account, in particular, the reasonable expectations of the data subject, as well as the scope of the processing in question and its impact on that person. See judgment of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others (General terms and conditions of use of a social network), C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 116). a.\[General terms and conditions of use of a social network\], C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 116).

(88) With regard to Article 6(1), first subparagraph, point (f) of the GDPR, the Court has held that that provision must be interpreted as meaning that processing can be considered necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, within the meaning of that provision, only if that processing is carried out within the limits of what is strictly necessary to achieve that legitimate interest and if, after weighing the competing interests, taking into account all the relevant circumstances, it follows that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects do not override the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party (see, to that effect, judgments of 4 May 2017, Rīgas satiksme, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph 116). 30, and of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others (General Terms and Conditions of Use of a Social Network), C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 126). (88) With regard to Article 6(1), first subparagraph, point (f) of the GDPR, the Court has held that that provision must be interpreted as meaning that processing can be regarded as necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party within the meaning of that provision only if that processing is carried out within the limits of what is strictly necessary to achieve that legitimate interest and if it follows from a balancing of the competing interests, taking into account all the relevant circumstances, that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects do not override the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party. See, to that effect, judgments of 4 May 2017, Rīgas satiksme, C-13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph 30, and of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others (General Terms and Conditions of Use of a Social Network), C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 126).

(89) In this context, the referring court refers to two aspects of the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings. First, that processing implies multiple storage of the data, i.e., not only in a public register, but also in the databases of credit reporting agencies, which companies do not store for a specific reason, but in case their contractual partners request information from them. Second, those companies store that data for three years on the basis of codes of conduct within the meaning of Article 40 GDPR, whereas national law provides for a storage period of only six months for the public register. (89) In this context, the referring court draws attention to two aspects of the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings. First, that processing entails multiple storage of the data, i.e., not only in a public register, but also in the databases of credit reporting agencies, which companies do not store for a specific reason, but rather in case their contractual partners request information from them. Second, those companies store that data for three years on the basis of codes of conduct within the meaning of Article 40 of the GDPR, whereas national law provides for a storage period of only six months for the public register.

(90) Regarding the first aspect, SCHUFA argues that it would be impossible to provide information in a timely manner if a credit agency were required to await a specific request for information before beginning to collect data.

(91) In that regard, it is for the referring court to examine whether SCHUFA's retention of the data at issue in its own databases is limited to what is strictly necessary to pursue its legitimate interest, even though the data in question can be consulted in the public register and without a commercial undertaking having requested information in a specific case. Otherwise, SCHUFA's retention of that data during the period during which that data is publicly available could not be considered necessary.

(92) As regards the duration of data retention, it must be considered that the examination of the second and third conditions referred to in paragraph 75 of this judgment overlaps in that the assessment of whether, in the present case, the legitimate interests pursued by the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings cannot reasonably be achieved by a shorter retention period requires a balancing of the competing rights and interests.

(93) As regards the balancing of the legitimate interests pursued, it should be noted that, insofar as it enables an objective and reliable assessment of the creditworthiness of the potential customers of the credit agency's contractual partners, the analysis carried out by a credit agency may compensate for discrepancies in information and thus reduce the risk of fraud and other uncertainties.

(94) However, as regards the rights and interests of the data subject, the processing by a credit agency of data relating to the granting of discharge of residual debt, such as the storage, analysis and transmission of those data to a third party, constitutes a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the data subject as enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Such data serve as a negative factor in the assessment of the data subject’s creditworthiness and therefore constitute sensitive information concerning his or her private life (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph 98). Their processing may cause serious harm to the interests of the data subject, since such disclosure is likely to make it significantly more difficult for the data subject to exercise his or her freedoms, in particular when it comes to meeting basic needs. (94) However, as regards the rights and interests of the data subject, the processing of data relating to the granting of discharge from residual debt, such as the storage, analysis and transmission of those data to a third party, by a credit agency constitutes a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the data subject as enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Such data serve as a negative factor in the assessment of the data subject’s creditworthiness and therefore constitute sensitive information concerning his or her private life (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph 98). Their processing may cause serious harm to the interests of the data subject, since such disclosure is likely to make it significantly more difficult for the data subject to exercise his or her freedoms, in particular when it comes to meeting basic needs.

(95) Furthermore, as the Commission has stated, the longer the data in question are stored by credit reference agencies, the greater the consequences for the interests and private life of the data subject and the higher the requirements regarding the lawfulness of storing that information.

(96) It should also be noted that, as is clear from recital 76 of Regulation 2015/848, the objective of a public insolvency register is to ensure better information for the creditors and courts concerned. In this context, Article 79(5) of that Regulation merely provides that Member States must inform data subjects of the period for which their personal data stored in insolvency registers will be accessible, without specifying a retention period for those data. However, it follows from Article 79(4) of this Regulation that, in accordance with this Article, it is incumbent on Member States to collect data and store it in national databases. The retention period for this data must therefore be determined in compliance with this Regulation.

(97) In the present case, the German legislature provides that information on the granting of discharge from residual debt is to be stored in the insolvency register for only six months. It therefore assumes that, after a period of six months, the rights and interests of the data subject outweigh those of the public in having access to this information.

(98) Furthermore, as the Advocate General stated in point 75 of his Opinion, the discharge of residual debt granted is intended to enable the beneficiary to re-engage in economic life and is therefore, in general, of vital importance for that person. However, the achievement of that objective would be jeopardised if, in order to assess a person’s financial situation, credit reference agencies could store data relating to a discharge of residual debt and use such data after they have been deleted from the public insolvency register, since those data are always used as a negative factor in the assessment of such a person’s creditworthiness.

(99) In those circumstances, the interest of the credit sector in having information relating to a discharge of residual debt cannot justify the processing of personal data such as those at issue in the main proceedings after the expiry of the period for storing the data in the public insolvency register. Consequently, the storage of those data by a credit reference agency for the period following the deletion of those data from a public insolvency register cannot be relied upon in the light of the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) of the EC Treaty. (99) In those circumstances, the interests of the credit sector in having information relating to discharge from residual debt cannot justify the processing of personal data such as that at issue in the main proceedings after the expiry of the period for storing the data in the public insolvency register, so that the storage of those data by a credit reference agency cannot be based on Article 6(1), first subparagraph, point (f) of the GDPR, as regards the period following their deletion from a public insolvency register.

(100) As regards the six-month period during which the data in question are also available in that public register, it should be noted that, although the effects of storing those data in the databases of such credit reference agencies in parallel with that period can be considered less serious than after the expiry of the six-month period, that storage nevertheless constitutes an interference with the rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. In that regard, the Court has already held that the presence of the same personal data in several sources increases the interference with the individual’s right to respect for private life (see judgment of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraphs 86 and 87). It is for the referring court to balance the interests in question and the impact on the data subject in order to determine whether the parallel storage of that data by private credit agencies may be regarded as limited to what is strictly necessary, as required by the case-law of the Court cited in paragraph 88 of the present judgment. (100) As regards the period of six months during which the data in question are also available in that public register, it should be noted that, although the effects of storing that data in the databases of such agencies in parallel with that period may be regarded as less serious than after the expiry of that six-month period, that storage nevertheless constitutes an interference with the rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. In that regard, the Court has already held that the presence of the same personal data in several sources aggravates the interference with the individual’s right to respect for private life (see judgment of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C-131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraphs 86 and 87). It is for the referring court to balance the interests at issue against the impact on the data subject in order to determine whether the parallel storage of that data by private credit reference agencies may be regarded as limited to what is strictly necessary, as required by the Court’s case-law cited in paragraph 88 of the present judgment.

3.3.5.3 The ECJ thus ultimately leaves considerable discretion to the courts of the Member States in the balancing of interests to be carried out, even though it states that the existence of a discharge of residual debt in connection with the statutory deletion from a public register indicates unlawful further processing in private databases.

3.3.5.4. The complainant has rightly objected that the present case differs in that the data origin is not a public register, but the underlying data was disclosed and processed based on private law agreements. In the already cited case law of the Administrative Court Ro 2020/04/0031, the Administrative Court has already adopted the ECJ's legal opinion regarding data originating from public registers.

3.3.6 Right to erasure due to unlawful processing pursuant to Art. 17 (1) (d) GDPR

3.3.6 Right to erasure due to unlawful processing pursuant to Art. 17 (1) (d) GDPR

3.3.6.1. Pursuant to Art. 17 (1) (d) GDPR, the data subject has the right to request the controller to erase personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller is obliged to erase personal data without undue delay if it has been "unlawfully processed." Art. 17 GDPR grants the data subject, among other things, a right to erasure if personal data has been unlawfully processed (lit. d). Article 17 therefore provides protection against unlawful data collection, similar to Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act, by obliging a controller to delete data immediately (regardless of a request) if the other criteria of the cumulative requirements to be examined no longer apply (judgment of 24 November 2011, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, and reiterated in the judgment of 11 December 2019, C-708/17 ECLI:EU:C:2019:1064; likewise judgment of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others (General Terms and Conditions of Use of a Social Network), C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, para. 109 and the case law cited therein) or if they were not met at all. 3.3.6.1. According to Article 17, paragraph 1, letter d, GDPR, the data subject has the right to request the controller to erase personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller is obliged to erase personal data without undue delay if it has been "unlawfully processed." Article 17, GDPR grants the data subject, among other things, the right to erasure if personal data has been unlawfully processed (letter d). Article 17, similar to paragraph 1 of the Data Protection Act, therefore provides protection against unlawful data collection by obliging a controller to delete data immediately (without request) if the other criteria of the cumulative requirements to be examined no longer apply (judgment of 24 November 2011, C-468/10 and C-469/10, EU:C:2011:777, and reiterated in the judgment of 11 December 2019, C-708/17 ECLI:EU:C:2019:1064; likewise judgment of 4 July 2023, Meta Platforms and Others (General Terms and Conditions of Use of a Social Network), C-252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 109 and the case law cited therein) or if they were not met at all.

3.3.6.2. The complainant has also complied with this criterion regarding the collection of data, as the collection of data is based on a legally permissible private-sector agreement.

However, the complainant is mistaken in that the permissibility of disclosure by transmission pursuant to Article 4(1) GDPR as a processing requirement does not allow any statement to be derived regarding the maximum permissible storage period within the scope of processing in the overriding legitimate interest. However, the complainant is mistaken in that the permissibility of disclosure by transmission pursuant to Article 4(1) GDPR as a processing requirement does not allow any statement to be derived regarding the maximum permissible storage period within the scope of processing in the overriding legitimate interest.

As already stated above, throughout the entire data processing period, personal data must be processed cumulatively in a lawful manner in accordance with Article 5 (1) (a) GDPR, in good faith and in a manner that is understandable to the data subject (“lawfulness, processing in good faith, transparency”), whereby the necessary requirements for lawful processing are explicitly set out in Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (VwGH 09.05.2023, Ro 2020/04/0037 para. 35 and cf. ECJ 4.5.2023, C-60/22, Federal Republic of Germany \[Electronic Court File\], ECLI:EU:C:2023:373, para. 56). As already stated above, throughout the entire data processing period, personal data must be processed cumulatively in a lawful manner in accordance with Article 5 (1) (a) GDPR, in good faith and in a manner that is understandable to the data subject. processed in a comprehensible manner ("lawfulness, fairness, transparency"), whereby the necessary requirements for lawful processing are explicitly set out in Article 6, paragraph 1, letter f, GDPR (VwGH 9 May 2023, Ro 2020/04/0037, para. 35 and compare ECJ 4 May 2023, C-60/22, Federal Republic of Germany \[Electronic Court File\], ECLI:EU:C:2023:373, para. 56).

3.3.7. On the overriding legitimate interest

3.3.7.1. First (also to avoid repetition), reference should be made to the recent case law of the VwGH and the ECJ under 3.3.6 and 3.3.5. The following will address the extent to which the principles can be transferred and the extent to which the subject matter of the complaint should be viewed differently:

The complainant operates as a credit information agency pursuant to Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO). The duties of traders within the meaning of Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) include providing information on the creditworthiness of companies and private individuals to third parties. The purpose of these traders is to provide lenders with meaningful information about existing or potential borrowers, in particular about the nature and manner of their debt repayment to date (Riesz in Ennöckl/Raschauer/Wessely, GewO Section 152, margin number 2). This is a defined, clear, and legally recognized purpose (Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act). In this respect, and in the absence of any additional submissions or apparent differences from SCHUFA, it can be assumed that the ECJ's considerations regarding the legitimate interests of the controller can be applied to the complainant. The complainant does not object to this, as she identified the essential difference between the present case and the ECJ's ruling in another data source. The complainant operates as a credit information agency pursuant to Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO). The duties of traders within the meaning of Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) include providing information on the creditworthiness of companies and private individuals to third parties. The purpose of these traders is to provide lenders with meaningful information about existing or potential borrowers, in particular about the nature and manner of their debt repayment to date (Riesz in Ennöckl/Raschauer/Wessely, GewO Section 152, para. 2). This is a defined, unambiguous, and legally recognized purpose (Section 152, Trade Regulation Act). In this respect, and in the absence of any additional arguments or apparent differences from SCHUFA, it can be assumed that the ECJ's considerations regarding the legitimate interests of the controller can be applied to the complainant – in this respect, the complainant does not object, as she identified the essential difference between the present case and the ECJ's ruling in another data source.

The data is also correct and complete. It is also fundamentally necessary and suitable for making a forecast of future payment behavior (see also ECJ 23.11.2006, Case C-238/05 para. 47 regarding systems for the exchange of information between financial institutions).

3.3.7.2 Regarding the interests of the co-participating party, there are also no apparent reasons why the ECJ's reasoning could not be applied to the present case:

As regards the rights and interests of the data subject, the processing of data relating to the granting of discharge of residual debt, such as the storage, analysis, and transmission of such data to a third party, by a credit agency constitutes a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the data subject enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Such data serve as a negative factor in the assessment of the data subject's creditworthiness and therefore constitute sensitive information concerning their private life (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C‑131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph 98). As regards the rights and interests of the data subject, the processing of data relating to the granting of discharge of residual debt, such as the storage, analysis and transmission of those data to a third party, by a credit agency constitutes a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the data subject as enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Such data serve as a negative factor in the assessment of the data subject’s creditworthiness and therefore constitute sensitive information concerning his or her private life (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 May 2014, Google Spain and Google, C‑131/12, EU:C:2014:317, paragraph 98).

This assessment by the European Court of Justice, that the processing of data relating to insolvency constitutes a negative factor in assessing the creditworthiness of the data subject due to the processing of sensitive information concerning their private life, and that its processing may significantly harm the interests of the data subject, as it is likely to significantly impede the exercise of their freedoms, particularly when it comes to meeting basic needs, also applies, in the opinion of the court, to the processing of payment history data disclosed to credit agencies by debt collection agencies and not derived from public insolvency registers, due to at least similar consequences. In particular, it is not clear why it should be less intrusive for the furtherance of the co-participating party that the data does not concern claims pursued in court and that there is no (court-determined) over-indebtedness, but merely temporary default. A granted discharge of residual debt is also comparable to the debt-discharging payment of an amount owed – especially since, as a rule, it does not satisfy a portion of the debt, but rather discharges the debt completely. Here, too, the beneficiary should be able to participate in economic life again and is therefore generally of existential importance for that person. Furthermore, the longer the data in question is stored by credit reporting agencies, the greater the consequences for the interests and private life of the data subject.

3.3.8 Right to erasure due to cessation of the purpose of data processing pursuant to Art. 17 (1) (a) GDPR - Retention period (Art. 5 (1) (c) and (e) GDPR). 3.3.8 Right to erasure due to cessation of the purpose of data processing pursuant to Article 17 (1) (a) GDPR - Retention period (Article 5 (1) (c) and (e) GDPR).

The principles set out by the European Court of Justice in its judgment of 7 December 2023 in joined cases C‑26/22 and C‑64/22 \[SCHUFA Holding AG\], that the practice of storing information on the insolvencies of natural persons from public registers by private credit agencies for the purpose of providing information on the creditworthiness of these persons for a period exceeding the storage period of the data in the public registers is not compatible with Article 5 (1) (a) in conjunction with. Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR are therefore also relevant to the subject matter of the proceedings. The principles set out by the European Court of Justice in its judgment of December 7, 2023, in the joined cases C-26/22 and C-64/22 \[SCHUFA Holding AG\], namely that the practice of storing information on the insolvencies of natural persons originating from public registers by private credit agencies for the purpose of providing information on the creditworthiness of these persons for a period exceeding the storage period of the data in the public registers is not consistent with Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a, in conjunction with Article 6, paragraph 1, letter f, GDPR, are therefore also relevant to the subject matter of the proceedings.

Taking into account the cited case law of the European Court of Justice, the balancing of interests generally favors the co-participating party if credit-relevant entries are retained for longer than in public registers. As already explained, the data processed through the private collection of debts is potentially no less of a hindrance to the advancement of a data subject if it results in a negative assessment of their creditworthiness.

In accordance with the principles of purpose limitation (Article 5 (1) (b) GDPR), data minimization (Article 5 (c) leg. cit.) and storage limitation (Article 5 (e) leg. cit.), data are subject to a right to erasure if they are no longer necessary to fulfil the purposes for which they were originally collected or otherwise processed (see ECJ 20 October 2022, C‑77/21, Digi, ECLI:EU:C:2022:805, para. 54; Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm \[2022\] Art. 17 para. 48; Dix in Simitis/Hornung/Spiecker (eds), Datenschutzrecht \[2019\] Art. 17, para. 10; Peuker in Sydow, Europäische Datenschutzgrundverordnung2 \[2018\] Art. 17 para. 16). This principle of storage limitation establishes a time limit for the processing of personal data (Herbst in Kühling/Buchner, GDPR BDSG3 \[2020\] Art. 5 para. 64). As a guideline for how long payment history data is suitable for assessing the creditworthiness of a (potential) debtor, observation or deletion periods in legal provisions that serve to protect creditors or specify the requirements for a suitable credit assessment can be used (cf. OGH 23.6.2021, 6 Ob 87/21v, para. 19; VwGH 09.05.2023, Ro 2020/04/0037, para. 63). According to the principles of purpose limitation (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter b, GDPR), data minimization (letter c, leg. cit.), and storage limitation (letter e, leg. cit.), data is subject to a right to deletion if it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was originally collected or otherwise processed (cf. ECJ 20.10.2022, C‑77/21, Digi, ECLI:EU:C:2022:805, para. 54; Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm \[2022\] Article 17, para. 48; Dix in Simitis/Hornung/Spiecker (eds), Datenschutzrecht \[2019\] Article 17, para. 10; Peuker in Sydow, European General Data Protection Regulation \[2018\] Article 17, para. 16). This principle of storage limitation establishes a time limit for the processing of personal data (Herbst in Kühling/Buchner, GDPR BDSG \[2020\] Article 5, para. 64). As a guideline for how long payment history data is suitable for assessing the creditworthiness of a (potential) debtor, observation or deletion periods in legal provisions that serve to protect creditors or further specify the requirements for a suitable credit assessment can be used (see OGH June 23, 2021, 6 Ob 87/21v, para. 19; VwGH May 9, 2023, Ro 2020/04/0037, para. 63).

In this assessment, the amount of the individual claims, the time at which the final default on the claim was established, and the date of entry in the database are important factors. Historical payment information becomes less meaningful the further back it dates and the longer there has been no further payment delays or defaults. As a guideline for how long payment history data is suitable for assessing the creditworthiness of a (potential) debtor, observation or deletion periods in legal provisions that serve to protect creditors or further specify the requirements for a suitable credit assessment can be used (see OGH 23.6.2021, 6 Ob 87/21v, para. 19). In weighing up the various factors, the amount of the individual claims, the time at which the final default on the claim was established, and the date of entry in the database are important. Historical payment information becomes less meaningful the further back it dates and the longer there has been no further payment delays or defaults. As a guideline for how long payment history data is suitable for assessing the creditworthiness of a (potential) debtor, observation or deletion periods in legal provisions that serve to protect creditors or that further specify the requirements for an appropriate credit assessment can be used (see OGH June 23, 2021, 6 Ob 87/21v, para. 19).

According to the cited case law of the European Court of Justice, the storage of data from public insolvency registers with regard to the period after the deletion of this data from a public insolvency register cannot be based on Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

According to the cited case law of the European Court of Justice, the storage of data from public insolvency registers with regard to the period after the deletion of this data from a public insolvency register cannot be based on Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The Austrian Insolvency Code stipulates in Section 256 (2) IO that insolvency data is generally publicly accessible for up to one year after the conclusion of insolvency proceedings. Section 256 (2) IO stipulates that insolvency data is generally publicly accessible for up to one year after the conclusion of insolvency proceedings.

Accordingly, creditworthiness data (under Austrian law) must be deleted no later than one year after debt-discharging payment (enforcement proceedings) unless there are individual reasons to the contrary, because a legitimate interest in processing is contraindicated. Therefore, claims that have been verifiably settled positively must be deleted at least after one year, in accordance with Article 5 (1) (a) in conjunction with Article 17 (1) (d) GDPR in conjunction with Section 256 IO. The claims of the co-participating party in question were verifiably settled on XXXX 2021, XXXX 2023, XXXX 2021, and XXXX 2021, which is why all of the payment history data stored by the complainant had to be deleted. Accordingly, creditworthiness data (under Austrian law) must be deleted no later than one year after debt-discharging payment (debt enforcement), unless there are individual reasons to the contrary, because a legitimate interest in processing is contraindicated. Therefore, verifiably settled claims must be deleted at least after one year, in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a, in conjunction with Article 17, paragraph 1, letter d, GDPR in conjunction with Section 256, IO. The claims of the co-participating party in question were verifiably settled on Roman 40 2021, Roman 40 2023, Roman 40 2021, and Roman 40 2021, which is why all the payment history data stored by the complainant had to be deleted.

In the present case, no (additional) circumstances have emerged that would indicate individual reasons relating to the co-participating party (such as relevant criminal convictions or other evidence) that would influence the balancing of interests to the detriment of the co-participating party.

Conversely, no reasons are apparent that storage was inadmissible even before the expiration of the maximum permissible period of one year.

Nor is there a case in which the underlying legitimate claim has not been positively settled.

3.4. Regarding the omission of the oral hearing:

According to Section 24 (1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems it necessary, ex officio.

According to Section 24 (1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems it necessary, ex officio. Pursuant to Section 24(4) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), unless otherwise provided by federal or state law, the administrative court may, notwithstanding a party's request, dispense with a hearing if the records indicate that the oral argument is unlikely to provide further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Article 6(1) of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude the dispensation of the hearing. Pursuant to Section 24(4) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), unless otherwise provided by federal or state law, the administrative court may, notwithstanding a party's request, dispense with a hearing if the records indicate that the oral argument is unlikely to provide further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Article 6(1) of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude the dispensation of the hearing.

The fact that the complainant processed the payment history data of the co-participating party, as well as the number and amount of the settled claims, are clearly evident from the facts of the case and were never disputed by the parties to the proceedings. The date on which the claims were settled by the co-participating party was also undisputed. In the present case, the failure to hold an oral hearing could therefore be justified by the fact that the facts of the case had been clarified from the file, which is why holding a public oral hearing would not contribute to further clarifying the facts and could therefore be omitted.

3.5. B) Admissibility of the appeal on points of law:

According to Section 25a (1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGG), the administrative court must state in its judgment or decision whether the appeal on points of law is admissible pursuant to Article 133 (4) of the Federal Constitutional Constitution Act (B-VG). The ruling must be briefly justified. Pursuant to Section 25a, Paragraph 1, of the Administrative Court Act (VwGG), the administrative court must state in its ruling or decision whether an appeal is admissible pursuant to Article 133, Paragraph 4, of the Federal Constitutional Court Act (B-VG). The ruling must be briefly justified.

The appeal is admissible pursuant to Article 133, Paragraph 4, of the Federal Constitutional Court Act (B-VG) because the decision depends on the resolution of a legal question of fundamental importance, namely whether credit reporting agencies may store data from private sources for periods exceeding one year, and under what conditions this is permissible. The previous case law of the Administrative Court on VwGH May 9, 2023, Ro 2020/04/0037 (Bank Warning List), and VwGH February 1, 2024, Ro 2020/04/0031 (Insolvency Files) does not provide any information on the maximum permissible storage period for data from private data sources in the area of private credit reporting agencies. Therefore, there is no case law of the Administrative Court on this issue and on whether the same time limits under Section 256 IO apply to data that does not originate from the insolvency file pursuant to Section 256 IO, in light of the judgment of the European Court of Justice of December 7, 2023, C-26/22 and C-64/22 (SCHUFA Holding/Residual Debt Discharge). The appeal is admissible pursuant to Article 133, Paragraph 4, of the Federal Constitutional Act (B-VG) because the decision depends on the resolution of a legal question of fundamental importance, namely whether credit reporting agencies may store data from private sources for periods exceeding one year and under what conditions this is permissible. The previous case law of the Administrative Court on VwGH May 9, 2023, Ro 2020/04/0037 (bank warning list) and VwGH February 1, 2024, Ro 2020/04/0031 (insolvency files) does not provide any information on the maximum permissible storage period for data from private sources in the area of private credit reporting agencies. Therefore, the Administrative Court lacks case law on this issue and on whether, in light of the judgment of the European Court of Justice of December 7, 2023, C-26/22 and C-64/22 (SCHUFA Holding/Residual Debt Discharge), the same time limits as per Section 256, IO, apply to data that does not originate from the insolvency file pursuant to Section 256, IO.

The decision was therefore made in accordance with the ruling.
