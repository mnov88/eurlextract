## English Summary

### Facts

While browsing on the Internet, a complainant typed his father's name into Google search and through one of the results managed to open a database without any authorization check. The DPA initiated an investigation. It concluded that the database included personal data of clients of a travel agency Robinson-Tours, such as names, dates of booking, reservation status, address, ID card details, passport numbers with date of issue and expiry, date of conclusion of the travel contract. On the website, it was also possible to filter people by destination and date. In some of the cases, it was possible to upload a passport photo or freely download individual customers' travel contracts.

As it turned out during the investigation, Robinson-Tours assigned Next Time Media Agency as a data processor with a task to implement appropriate security measures: firewall, anti-virus, multi-level authentication and access control, strong use and forced exchange of passwords, daily backup. Exposed data came from a test database which was filled with data of 781 real customers. They were available to anyone from November 13, 2019 to February 4, 2020.

The controller did not communicate data breach to data subjects. It did not carry out regular checks for security risks.

### Dispute

Robinsons-Tour and Next Time Media Agency were fined respectively 20 000 000 HUF and 500 000 HUF .

III. Decision

    1. Management, high risk classification and reporting of the data protection incident

About the vulnerability that triggered the data protection incident, Customer 1. first said that a
Authority NAIH / 2020/66/4. obtained from a fact-finding order on 4 February 2020

note. He was previously unaware of the vulnerability and the privacy incident. Customer
1. access to a database containing data on data subjects using their travel services
access could not be detected by Client 1 itself, thus about the incident and enabling it
only on the basis of an indication from the Authority.

Pursuant to Article 4 (12) of the General Data Protection Regulation, a
breach of security resulting in unauthorized access to the personal data processed

results. In terms of the concept, thus, the relationship with the security event is a key element
considered. The Authority shall grant several accesses on the basis of the information provided by the notifier of public interest
made to the database through the vulnerability, and later Customer 1.
he also acknowledged the vulnerability in an incident report. Through a website maintained by Customer 1
exploiting an available vulnerability, it was therefore possible to access the data concerned
access. Unauthorized access to personal information is therefore an IT security
this could have been exploited, which in several cases led to a data protection incident

resulted. Of these unauthorized accesses, the Authority has several cases
documented in his referenced notes.

Pursuant to Article 33 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, a data protection incident is
without undue delay and, if possible, no later than 72 hours after
data protection incident, he must report it to the supervisory authority. The incident
notification may be waived only if the incident is not likely to pose a risk to
the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Assessing the risks associated with the incident

the task of the data controller.

Recital 75 of the General Data Protection Regulation deals with the processing of data
which may result in identity theft or misuse of identity, and
in particular the processing of children's data with regard to the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned
considered fundamentally risky data management. The Authority also highlights that travel
data contained in contracts, such as the time and time of travel, and the contract

                                               From its value 11, further conclusions can be drawn regarding the financial circumstances of the given passenger. On this
in addition, compared to the address data also available, the residence of the person concerned
a conclusion can be drawn. The joint management of these data compared to the incident
circumstances, the Authority considers that there is a high-risk data protection incident
resulted.

In terms of the high risk to the privacy of the natural persons concerned

another important circumstance is that according to the Client's 2nd (data processor) statement the data subject
External illegal access to the database shall be restricted to the period from 24 January 2020 to 10 February 2020.
he was able to save his diary between. Total duration of the vulnerability (13 November 2019 -
The exact number of unauthorized accesses under February 4, 2020) is thus unknown.
based on the content of the public interest notification sent to the Authority on 29 December
has already been made, at least by the public interest notifier. The vulnerability lasts longer
its existence also increased the risks.

In view of the above, the Authority also considers high risk to be a factor justifying
that the database was accessed by both the notifier in the public interest and the Authority, but that
the total number of unauthorized accesses and the identity of the accessors for the duration of the vulnerability
cannot be accurately measured in the absence of a complete log file for The identity of the accessors and
number of Customer 1. can no longer subsequently assess and identify which is involved in the incident
gives a high degree of uncertainty and concern about the further fate of personal data

okot. The data controller is of an immeasurable degree and extent, but it has been proven to have happened
in the event of a data leak, you can only try to reduce the data subject by informing the parties concerned
high risks anyway.

The Authority considers that the additional circumstances justifying the high risk are that
personal information managed in this database has also been indexed by Google on this search engine
they were also available through, making them much easier to access even on the internet

you may also come across while browsing, randomly searching for a name.

Based on the above, the Authority considers that the data protection incident is high risk
therefore, if the controller becomes aware of such a case, it should be reported
report to the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 33 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
authority. The notification was made by the Data Controller by e-mail to the Authority on 6 February 2020,
Having become aware of that fact-finding order of the Authority in its opinion of 4 February 2020,

upon receipt. The data controller is thus obliged to report the incident
within 72 hours of receipt. The Authority shall comply with the notification obligation
therefore found no infringement.

    2. Informing data subjects about the data protection incident

In its 1st incident report, the client stated that it plans to inform the stakeholders a
the outcome of the official procedure after its conclusion. This statement or the official

on the basis of further statements sent to the Authority during the procedure, the Client 1. this decision
did not inform those concerned about the data protection incident by the general
under Article 34 of the Data Protection Regulation.

According to Article 34 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, it is the responsibility of the controller to:
inform the data subjects of the data protection incident without undue delay, if any
considered a high-risk incident.

                                               12The Authority considers that the incident is of a high risk which justifies
Article 34 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
as there may be spill-over effects on the privacy of those concerned
which the controller no longer has any influence over the incident management which he may carry out
(see previous section III./1 of this Decision on risk classification).

Incident risks - in recitals 85 to 86 of the General Data Protection Regulation
can only be effectively mitigated if those concerned do so
they are aware of and can take any further action they deem necessary.

Customer 1. as data controller is responsible for the occurrence of the data protection incident
you can assess your risks. This is because primarily the data controller is aware that
what personal data you handle, for what purposes and using data management methods. The

the possible high risk classification of the data protection incident and therefore the information to the data subject
assessment of the need is the Client's main task, the assessment of this issue cannot be transferred to the
"Depending on the outcome of the official procedure" by referring to the supervisory authority. The
the controller shall inform the data subjects of the incident without undue delay as soon as possible
has become known to him under Article 34 of the General Data Protection Regulation, he cannot wait for the authority
until the end of the procedure.

The Authority draws attention to Article 34 (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation
(c), if the information would require a disproportionate effort, the persons concerned
shall be informed by means of publicly available information or a similar measure shall be taken,
which ensures similarly effective information to stakeholders.

Based on the above, the Authority finds that the Client 1. due to the lack of information and its postponement
did not comply with Article 34 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, therefore a

With regard to Article 34 (4), Client 1 called on the parties concerned to inform them
on the high-risk privacy incident.

    3. Findings on security of data management

The Authority also examined that Client 1 as a data controller and Client 2 as a data processor
the extent to which data security directly related to the occurrence of the incident has been complied with

requirements for an existing system.

Pursuant to Article 32 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
and guaranteeing the data processor a level of data security commensurate with the degree of risk
technical and organizational measures in line with the state of science and technology
including the personal data pursuant to Article 32 (1) (b) of the Regulation
the continuing confidentiality of the systems and services used to manage the data
integrity, availability and resilience.

This is confirmed by Article 32 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, which states that
in determining the appropriate level of security, explicit consideration shall be given to
risks arising from the processing of data, in particular those transmitted, stored or otherwise
accidental or unlawful destruction or loss of personal data processed in this way,
unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized disclosure
derive from access.

                                               13The resulting vulnerability in the system affected by the data protection incident
it has been possible that inadequate security in the handling of personal data
settings were applied to the affected system as follows.

Customer 2. During the operation of the website, the relationship between the test and live database involved
has not terminated, and the website has not been subjected to adequate security or vulnerabilities

tests. The test database and already real data Customer 1. uploaded and used sharp
database thus maintained a connection channel through which the sharp data
were continuously transmitted in real time to the test database. This real-time connection
In addition to Client's 1st and Client's 2nd statements, trial downloads documented by the Authority and
accesses are also confirmed.

The vulnerability, a test database with live data, was therefore available for the vulnerability

as its safety was no longer addressed by Customer 2. after the development was completed.
The incident would not have occurred if the test database had been deleted by Customer 2. or it was secure
relocates to the environment or disconnects from the live database. These are omissions
thus, direct access to personal data was made possible.

The test database, as defined above, is practically a vulnerable copy of the live database
functioned, the size of which increased steadily over time. This is customer data

will result in duplication over three months. Extremely for personal information
it was easily accessible from the outside without being noticed by Customer 1 or Customer 2.

Customer 1. personal data processed in connection with the travel services it offers
because of the above, he used and operated his storage system and website in a way that anyone could do
could access it over the Internet due to the existence of a vulnerability. In this security
due to this deficiency, the confidentiality of the data is severely compromised, which is directly possible

made the occurrence of the high-risk privacy incident.

Customer 1. also argued that as a data processor, Customer 2. did not act to build the system
quite carefully and carefully during the course, and there was no authorization check for the system
system built.

In view of the above, the Authority concludes that:

    - Customer 1. loading the data into the system and managing it there, actually a
       use of the system,
    - Customer 2. careless operation of the system and inadequate security controls and
       through testing,
infringed Article 32 (1) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as a
during the running of the service, its confidential nature is neither data management nor data processing
could not guarantee.

    4. Findings on the principle of privacy by design and default

Article 25 (1) to (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation contains the built-in and
the principle of default data protection, according to which the risks of data management
appropriate technical and organizational measures must be taken by the controller
when defining the method of data management aimed at data protection principles
effective implementation. In addition, the controller is also responsible for providing appropriate technical and

                                                14Implement organizational measures to ensure that only the specific purpose
necessary data management. These measures must, in particular, ensure that:
personal data by default without the intervention of a natural person
become accessible to an indefinite number of persons.

To the database involved in the incident, originally created for testing purposes (which will later be live
data is also constantly updated), via Google search and simple web links

held by anyone from 13 November 2019 to 4 February 2020.

Managing the data stored in the database as explained in the previous sections alone
also resulted in high-risk data management, especially for children and contractual
data. The handling of such data is therefore increasingly on the part of data controllers
technical and organizational measures proportionate to the high risk are expected
already in the planning period of data management in order to guarantee the principles of data management.

Guaranteeing the confidentiality of data processing is enshrined in Article 5 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
also appears in paragraph (f). According to this, personal data must be processed in this way
to be carried out by appropriate technical or organizational measures
adequate security and confidentiality of personal data, such as illegal data processing
to prevent.

Pursuant to Article 25 (1) to (2), data controllers are thus required to plan, process and
they must proceed in such a way that, at the start of future data processing, it is
principles - e.g. the principles of integrity and confidentiality.

Customer 2. explained in connection with guaranteeing the confidentiality of the data management affected by the incident that
the whole system developed by him (which is practically the 1st website of the Client) during the development
not tested, not tested for safety, only done “around the point of entry”

inspections, the error leading to the incident could not be detected earlier. Customer 2. and a
nor does it have records of the inspections carried out
you could prove. Within the framework of Client's 1st order, Client 2 therefore failed to perform the
website and system design and development during those security tests or other
measures to eliminate or eliminate the causes of the vulnerability
would have been (e.g. website vulnerability scan, test and live database remaining
disconnection of the test environment).

The lack of the above planning measures allowed both knowing the link to the site,
both through Google’s search engine to anyone without any prior authorization checks
access personal data and documents stored on the online interface.

European Data Protection Board No. 4/2019, built-in and default data protection
guidelines on the principle of subsidiarity state that data controllers already have new data processing
should take into account the implementation of this principle and its implementation

they should check later. The guidelines emphasize that
data controller is responsible for the principle of built-in and default data protection
data processing operations performed by the data processor (s) for the fulfillment of obligations

                                               15 also. This must be taken into account by the controller when concluding a contract
with a data processor. 2

When defining data management, so in this case the website and related IT
the measures taken to design and develop the infrastructure were not sufficient

to ensure the confidentiality of data in accordance with Article 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation
nature. Thanks to this, later, through the website of personal data
have become available to an indefinite number of individuals.

As data controller, Customer 1 is responsible for the data processor entrusted by him (Customer 2).

due diligence when concluding a data processing contract
act when selecting the appropriate data processor. Within the framework of the data processing contract
Customer 2. negligently designed and developed the system for which only the privacy
at the time of the incident, it was not previously reported by either Customer 1 or Customer 2
note.

At the basic level, data processing that is illegal, unsafe and leading to a serious incident is thus
was practically determined already in the design and development phase of the system, when even the
specific data management has not yet started. Subsequent infringements are straightforward
consequence of careless design and inadequate data processing mandate.

Serious design deficiencies and gender leading to a high-risk privacy incident

due to the order of the appropriate data processor Customer 1. therefore violated the general data protection
Article 25 (1) to (2) of this Regulation.

    5. Sanction and justification applied

1) In clarifying the facts, the Authority has established with regard to Client 1 that

data management
    - infringed Article 25 (1) to (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation,
    - infringed Article 32 (1) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation,
    - infringed Article 34 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

In view of this, the Authority instructed the Client to do so, as set out in the operative part

take the necessary measures to inform those concerned about the data protection incident
Article 34 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Authority has examined whether it is justified to impose a data protection fine on Client 1. E
Article 83 (2) of the GDPR and Infotv. 75 / A. § considered by the

all the circumstances of the case.

In view of this, the Authority Pursuant to Section 61 (1) (a), in the operative part
and in this decision Customer 1 to pay a data protection fine
obliged.

In imposing the fine, the Authority took into account the following factors:

2.0\_en.pdf

                                                 16The Authority considered the following as an aggravating circumstance:

  - The handling of personal data affected by the incident is high due to the nature of the data
      therefore data controllers should exercise extreme caution
      to guarantee a level of data security commensurate with the level of risk. Customer 1.
      nevertheless, a large number of personal data (a total of 781 data subjects, a total of about 2506 pieces)
      personal data, including data on children and contractual amounts

      ensure the continued confidentiality of your data management system
      has not taken appropriate measures to

  - The Authority has identified a fundamentally high-risk data management
      Customer 1. Unsuitable for preventing and detecting unauthorized access, a
      applied disproportionate data security measures when personal
      data could be accessed extremely easily from the outside without being noticed by Customer 1.

      would be. Security preparedness to handle such data from for-profit businesses
      highly expected.

  - the Authority became aware of the data protection incident on the basis of a public interest report,
      No privacy incident was detected by Customer 1.

  - The Authority identified identified data security vulnerabilities as a systemic problem

      considers that the infringing situation has been demonstrated by unauthorized access
      months before the occurrence of the test, the data controller had the relevant test database
      respect.

  - The breach of data confidentiality was practically determined by the system
      sloppy design when even specific data management has not begun. The later
      infringing data management is a direct consequence of negligent design and inadequate

      data processing mandate.

  - Customer 1. as data controller is responsible for ensuring that any data protection has occurred
      assess the risks of an incident. This is because the controller is aware that
      what personal data, for what purposes and using data management methods
      treats. The potential high risk classification of a privacy incident and therefore about
      Assessing the need for stakeholder information Customer's 1st main task is this issue

      cannot be transferred by reference to the “functions of the outcome of the official procedure” a
      supervisory authority. The controller shall, without undue delay, consult the data subject
      report the incident as soon as it becomes aware of it, in accordance with Article 34 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
      may not wait until the formal procedure has been completed.

The Authority considered the following as mitigating circumstances:

    - In the course of the procedure, the Authority did not become aware of any information
        that the persons concerned have suffered damage as a result of the infringement.

    - From the facts revealed, it can be concluded that the infringement was not intentional, it
        Caused by customer 1. negligence. This is also indicated by the fact that the Client is about the incident
        immediately upon becoming aware of the vulnerability, action was taken
        in order to eliminate.

                                                 17 - The Authority took into account that the Client had not previously established a
        personal data breach.

Other circumstances considered:

    - After becoming aware of a data protection incident, Customer 1. is the incident
        Article 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation

        immediately took the action required by the Commission to investigate the incident, it referred it to the Authority
        reported the vulnerability within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, Customer 2.
        terminated and the illegally managed database deleted. The Authority
        Thus, Customer 1 did not identify any problem in its specific privacy incident management practices.
        The Authority did not, in breach of its legal obligations,
        not specifically assessed as an attenuating circumstance.

    - The Authority also took into account that Client 1. cooperated in everything a
        Authority in the investigation of the case, although this conduct is not - as the law
        obligations were also not exceeded, he assessed as explicitly mitigating
        as a circumstance.

In view of the above, the Authority considers it necessary to impose a fine, only Infotv. 75 / A.
Did not consider it appropriate to apply the warning under

The amount of the data protection fine shall be exercised in the exercise of the Authority's statutory discretion
determined.

Infringements by Customer 1. Article 83 (4) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
are considered to be infringements of the lower fine category.

In imposing the fine, the Authority finally took into account the Client's 1. economic weight. In this round
took into account that
    - according to its 2019 report, HUF 5,344,545,000 (five billion
        three hundred and forty-four million to five hundred and forty-five thousand forints).
    - According to its annual report closing the liquidation activity in 2020, on 1 January 2020
        551,404,000 HUF (five hundred and fifty-one million
        four hundred and four thousand forints).

    - It will be liquidated from 16 June 2020.

The Authority for the period of the infringement (13 November 2019 to 4 February 2020)
took into account the economic data for 2019 and 2020. The infringement
In view of the weight of the Client and the above-mentioned management data of the Client, the amount of the fine imposed is therefore a
In the opinion of the Authority, it can be considered proportionate to the gravity of the infringement.

2) In clarifying the facts, the Authority has established with regard to Client 2 that the
infringed Article 32 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
(b).

The Authority has examined whether it is justified to impose a data protection fine on Client 2.
In this context, the Authority will comply with Article 83 (2) of the GDPR and Infotv. 75 / A. § considered by the
all the circumstances of the case.

                                                 18 In view of this, the Authority Pursuant to Section 61 (1) (a), in the operative part
and in this decision the Client also pays 2 data protection fines
obliged.

In imposing the fine, the Authority took into account the following factors:

The Authority considered the following as an aggravating circumstance:

  - The handling of personal data affected by the incident is higher due to the nature of the data
      therefore data controllers should exercise extreme caution
      to guarantee a level of data security commensurate with the level of risk. Customer 2.
      nevertheless, a large number of personal data (a total of 781 data subjects, a total of about 2506 pieces)
      personal data, including data on children and contractual amounts
      data) system developed and operated by it for the Client

      has not taken appropriate measures to ensure its continued confidentiality.

  - The Authority has identified a fundamentally high-risk data management
      Customer 2. Unsuitable for the prevention and detection of unauthorized access, a
      applied disproportionate data security measures when personal
      data could be accessed extremely easily from the outside without being noticed by Customer 2.
      would be. Security preparedness to handle such data from for-profit businesses

      highly expected.

  - the Authority became aware of the data protection incident on the basis of a public interest report,
      No privacy incident was detected by Customer 2.

  - The Authority identified identified data security vulnerabilities as a systemic problem
      considers that the infringing situation has been demonstrated by unauthorized access

      months before the occurrence of the test database in question.

  - Customer 2. failed to perform the website and system development during that security
      tests or other security measures to detect the vulnerability; or
      could have been eliminated (e.g., website vulnerability scan, test and live database
      termination of the remaining relationship). These defaults to Customer 2 are high
      as the main activity is the provision of IT services

      operates as a business.

The Authority considered the following as mitigating circumstances:

    - In the course of the procedure, the Authority did not become aware of any information
        that the persons concerned have suffered damage as a result of the infringement.

    - The Authority took into account that Client 2 had not previously established a

        personal data breach.

Other circumstances considered:

    - The Authority also took into account that Client 2. cooperated in everything a
        Authority during the investigation of the case, although this conduct - as required by law

                                                  19 obligations were also not exceeded - it was not assessed as explicitly mitigating
        as a circumstance.

In view of the above, the Authority considers it necessary to impose a fine, only Infotv. 75 / A.
Did not consider it appropriate to apply the warning under

The amount of the data protection fine shall be exercised in the exercise of the Authority's statutory discretion

determined.

Infringements by Customer 2. Article 83 (4) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
are considered to be infringements of the lower fine category.

In imposing the fine, the Authority finally took into account the 2nd economic weight of the Client. In this round
took into account that

    - According to its 2019 report, HUF 47,155,000 (forty-seven million to one hundred and fifty-five thousand forints)
        had net sales.
    - According to its annual report for the year 2020 due to the changeover of the tax type, 1 January 2020
