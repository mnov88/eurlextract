## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is an employer (company) that had dealt with a mass infection of COVID-19 at the company. To prevent this from happening again, the controller collected the full name and medical condition of employees who were positive with COVID (the data subjects). It then sent out an email to all of the other employees who may have been in contact with an infected employee, by informing them of the person who had been tested positive for COVID. Moreover, the controller did not keep a database of all persons infected with COVID and had informed all employees about their rights under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

The DPA started an investigation ex officio into the processing of health data and whether the controller was compliant with the GDPR.

### Holding

The DPA noted that informing employees who may have been in contact with an employee of the fact that they have been in contact with an infected colleague, was a preventive measure of public health protection. However, it found that the controller could have also informed these employees without disclosing the infected employees' full name. According to the DPA, the objective of preventing a mass-spreading could still have been achieved this way. Consequently, the DPA found that the controller unlawfully processed the infected employee's health data, pursuant to [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), and violated the principle of data minimisation, [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR").

The DPA ordered, pursuant to [Article 58(2)(d)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2d "Article 58 GDPR"), to bring the controller's processing operations into compliance with [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), and thus to inform employees who had contact with a positive employee, without providing that positive employees' name.

## Comment

There is no detailed information whether the controller complied sufficiently with [Article 13(1)](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#1 "Article 13 GDPR") and [Article 13(2)](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#2 "Article 13 GDPR"). Moreover, although health data was being processed and the DPA referred to [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), it did not specify which exception of [Article 9(2)](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2 "Article 9 GDPR") was applicable.

II. IP findings and explanations and positions of the obligor:

During the inspection procedure, the liable party was reminded that in the procedure before the IP he had to tell the truth and the consequences of a false confession.

During the proceedings, the liable party explained the following, namely that:

 does not keep records of covid-19 cases, estimates that there were approximately… patients;
 the procedure of informing employees about patients with covid-19 disease is carried out by informing the patient by phone… the taxpayer stays at home or in quarantine until recovery, if no high-risk contacts have occurred , the taxpayer warns by e-mail all employees who are or could be in high-risk contact with the sick person (providing the person's name and test result);
 in principle informs only persons who came into direct contact with an infected or sick person in the course of the work process, exceptionally acted differently when the virus first entered…, as it was not possible to identify who was in high-risk contact. A questionnaire was sent to the employees, on the advice of occupational medicine, so that high-risk contacts could be traced as soon as possible. During the month…, however,… it sent an individual questionnaire to all employees on the connection with high-risk groups in order to organize work in a way that would minimize the impact on potentially endangered employees or employees who are close to people at risk;
 have adopted the Rules on procedures and measures for personal data protection (adopted on the basis of cooperation between employees and the union), and in specific cases collected data… as… and organizer of the work process, communication was by telephone, patients were properly informed about the content has no written evidence;
Lovni the work process is… specific, work usually takes place in smaller but often flexibly composed…. Potential high-risk contacts between employees cannot always be assumed. In the last two years, work has been going on in extremely difficult circumstances.

The taxpayer submitted the following documentation:

 emails to employees of ...

On the basis of the Obligor's acquaintance with the findings in the inspection procedure and the call for clarification before the decision no. … Of… provided evidence that he had informed employees of their rights to information in accordance with Article 13 of the General Regulation and stated that he had observed the principle of proportionality in notifying infections by providing the name of infected employees by e-mail of… infections that are expected to occur at least… before detection and work in small… and the likelihood that all employees have come into contact with an infected employee (the liable party has… employees and external collaborators). He went on to state that they had been informed exclusively by e-mail of…, as all of them had been exposed to high-risk contact, and no information on the infection outside of that had been provided.

III. Reasons for such a decision in the light of the facts established:

On the basis of the inspection procedure carried out so far, the IP establishes the following facts. The person responsible for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus database does not keep employees informed of covid-19 patients in order to protect the health of employees and ensure a healthy working environment, but informing employees about the infection could and had to do so in such a way that he would not provide a specific name and surname when he provided information on persons suffering from covid-19 from the e-mail address zaposle… to employees with the name and surname in an e-mail dated…, that even insofar as the messages sent were forwarded to all employees who may have been able to come to t with the sick person. i. high-risk contact, the taxpayer should not provide the name and surname, as it would be sufficient to notify the infection and provide such a hidden copy - depending on the circumstances of the case, the taxpayer will have to decide in each case whether such initiation should be provided to a particular circle of employees or all.

The taxpayer should not provide the names and surnames of individuals suffering from covid-19 disease by processing their health data by passing it on to individuals, as such information may be provided without providing a specific name and surname.

If the taxpayer considers that anyone who could be in the taxpayer's registered office during a certain period could come into high-risk contact, he should further examine and substantiate why the general notice without mentioning a specific individual in such a way that he would not determined or identifiable would not achieve the same purpose.

IP notes that the taxpayer could send the same content of the message even without the name and surname of the employees, while achieving the same purpose of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. High-risk contacts could be sought individually, without disclosing the individual suffering from the disease, to all employees. Consequently, such information, in particular with the name and surname, resulted in unlawful processing of personal data and breach of the minimum data principle set out in Article 5 (1) (c) of the General Regulation, as the taxpayer could achieve the same effect and already with a general notice without stating the name and surname, which could also be sent to all listed stakeholders, if he found that in certain premises and in a certain period of time according to the specifics of the work process at the taxpayer, there was t. i. high-risk contact.

IV. Conclusion:

Point (d) of Article 58 (2) of the General Regulation provides that the supervisory authority shall order the controller or processor to comply with the provisions of the processing, if applicable, in a specified manner and within a specified time limit.

In view of the explained reasons, due to the identified irregularities, pursuant to Articles 2 and 8 of the ZInfP, point 1 of the first paragraph of Article 54 of ZVOP-1, the first paragraph of Article 32 of the ZIN and point (d) of Article 58 (2) of the General order the elimination of identified irregularities and the harmonization of the processing of personal data with the provisions of Article 5 (1) (c) of the General Regulation and Article 9 of the General Regulation, as set out in point 1 of the operative part of this Decision.

The fifth paragraph of Article 29 of the ZIN stipulates that if the inspector has ordered the elimination of irregularities and deficiencies and set a deadline for the obligor to eliminate them, he must immediately inform the inspector of the rectified irregularities. In accordance with the above, the liable party must notify the IP in writing of all implemented measures referred to in point 1 of the operative part of this decision no later than five (5) days after the elimination of the irregularity. The notification must also contain indications and evidence that the liable party has implemented the measures referred to in point 1 of the operative part of this decision and in what manner he has implemented them.

The ruling on the costs of the procedure is based on the provision of the first paragraph of Article 31 of the ZIN, according to which the costs of the inspection procedure, which were necessary to establish the facts proving that the taxpayer violated a law or other regulation, the taxpayer suffers. The liable party did not notify the costs of the procedure during the procedure, but no special costs of the procedure were incurred by the body.

This decision is issued ex officio and is based on Article 22 of the Administrative Fees Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 106/10 - official consolidated text, 14/15 - ZUUJFO, 84/15 - ZZelP-J, 32/16 , 30/18 - ZKZaš and 189/20 - ZFRO) tax free.
