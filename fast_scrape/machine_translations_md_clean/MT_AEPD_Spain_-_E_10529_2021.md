## English Summary

### Facts

#### Background

About a month after the "Schrems II ruling" by the CJEU ([CJEU - C-311/18 - Schrems II](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-311/18_-_Schrems_II "CJEU - C-311/18 - Schrems II")) the NGO _noyb_ filed 101 complaints regarding data transfers from EEA based websites to Google LLC and Facebook Inc. in the U.S (s_ee [here](https://noyb.eu/en/101-complaints-eu-us-transfers-filed) and [here](https://noyb.eu/en/update-noybs-101-complaints-eu-us-data-transfers))._ In order to coordinate the work of all involved DPAs, the EDPB created a [special task force](https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2020/european-data-protection-board-thirty-seventh-plenary-session-guidelines-controller_en?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTVRrMVlqRmpOMlF3TnpCbCIsInQiOiJFekdLKzFydWlOSHpaU1RDUTNUaHVWR2JxTVN4MnRDUm9jYTRkOGRxWG1LSDBWY1lBQkhaM2dsTkdoSEdYNlQrN2lFbm84d1Y3STRWMFlXZk5lM0dzeGFMd2p2NGFjVmltS1wvNnlCSmhrK3Nra1dGcGNjd2lEQWN6UW9EQVdtNmsifQ%3D%3D).

#### Complaint

On 18.08.2020, a data subject (represented by _noyb_) filed a complaint with the DSB against both the website provider (in its role as data exporter) and Google LLC (in its role as data importer), arguing that both respondents violated Articles 44 et. seqq. GDPR in light of the "Schrems II" ruling by transferring their personal data to Google LLC. As Google LLC qualifies as "_electronic communication service provider_" under 50 U.S. Code § 1881(b)(4), it is subject to surveillance by U.S. intelligence services and can be ordered to disclose data of European citizens - such as the data subject - to them.

The complaint was filed against the Spanish Royal Academy (Real Academia Española, "RAE").

The controller alleged that it is a public law institution that uses Google Analytics tools solely and exclusively for fulfilling the general interest purposes that constitute its ultimate goal, which is to ensure the development, dissemination, proper use and update of the Spanish language; in order to achieve that, it is necessary to have access to statistical data related to the access and use of these instruments, and also to know its evolution and adaptation to the reality of the use of the language at any given moment (e.g. statistics related to the use of terms not included in the dictionary can allow a better knowledge of the evolution in the use of the language and the possible inclusion of such terms in the future).

Through the use of Google Analytics, the controller can know essential information related to the use of the language and its diffusion worldwide.

The controller also alleged that it only had access to aggregated data that did not allow for identification of users. The controller had no access to personal data whatsoever, nor IPs or any other information. Hence, no personal data was processed.

The controller also indicated that it had subscribed a contract with Google LLC (Conditions for the Processing of Data) and that therefore the RAE was a controller while Google was a processor.

Furthermore, the controller alleged that it had only used the most basic functionalities of Google Analytics, guaranteeing the minimization of the use of data, so only aggregated data was processed.

Only the following data was gathered:

1.  Identification of the geographic area (city and country) from which the user of the user accessed the website and statistics by country.
2.  Language.
3.  Source from which the visit originates.
4.  Statistical flow of visits to the Web Site.
5.  Statistical analysis of visits, offering percentages of recurrent or first access visits.
6.  Browser used for access.
7.  Type of mobile device used.
8.  Screen resolution of the device and its operating system.

Nor Google Signals nor Comparatives were activated.

On 08.09.2020, the AEPD verified that the code of the website included the creation and storage of Google Analytics cookies.

On 27.10.2021, the AEPD confirmed that such code was not on the website anymore.

### Holding

The AEPD decided to accept the allegations of the controller and considered that the controller had not violated [Article 45 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_45_GDPR "Article 45 GDPR") nor any of the subsequent Articles from Chapter V of the GDPR. The AEPD took into account that the controller had stopped using Google Analytics short after the Schrems II ruling and that it had never used the obtained information to identify specific users.

Therefore, the DPA concluded that, at the time of issuing the decision, the controller was not in breach of the GDPR under the competential scope of the AEPD.

## Comment

This decision is the first DPA decision following _noyb_'s 101 complaints regarding EEA-US data transfers. The EDPB formed a "task force" on these cases to come to similar decisions in the EEA. Further decisions are expected soon. For details see [here](https://noyb.eu/en/101-complaints-eu-us-transfers-filed) and [here](https://noyb.eu/en/update-noybs-101-complaints-eu-us-data-transfers).

Some decisions have already been published by European DPAs. E.g. see [here](/index.php?title=DSB_\(Austria\)_-_2021-0.586.257_\(D155.027\) "DSB (Austria) - 2021-0.586.257 (D155.027)") and [here](/index.php?title=CNIL_\(France\)_-_Google_Analytics_\(no_case_number\) "CNIL (France) - Google Analytics (no case number)").

     File No.: E/10529/2021

                  RESOLUTION OF ACTIONS FILE

Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and
based on the following:

                                       FACTS

FIRST: Don A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claiming party), dated August 21,
2020, filed a claim with the Spanish Agency for Data Protection. The
The claim is directed against GOOGLE LLC and the ROYAL SPANISH ACADEMY (in
forward, this last RAE or the claimed party).

The reasons on which the claim is based are the following:

- Through HTML code embedded in the WWW.RAE.ES web page,
collected personal data from the claimant and have transferred it to the US through the
Google Analytics and Google Ads services contracted by the person in charge of the portal,

the RAE.

- During the visit of the complaining party to the mentioned website, the person in charge treated
your personal data (at least IP address and "cookies"), and, apparently,
some of this data was transferred to Google LLC. The complaining party had

signed in to your Google account associated with your email inbox.

- The complaining party maintains that the transfer of personal data to the US by
part of the person in charge through his treatment manager has no legal basis,
since the CJEU has invalidated the decision on the "EU-US Privacy Shield" in the
ruling C-311/18 ("Schrems II"), and the controller can no longer base the transfer of

data to Google in the USA in an adequacy decision pursuant to Art. 45 of the
GDPR.

- The person in charge cannot base the transfer of data on the clauses
contractual type provided for in arts. 46.2.c and 46.2.d of the GDPR, if the third country of
destination does not guarantee adequate protection of the personal data transferred

under those clauses, in accordance with EU law. The CJEU has ruled
explicitly that onward transfers to companies covered by the
Article 50 of the United States Code (USC), as is the case of Google,
violate the relevant articles of Chapter 5 of the GDPR, since, by virtue of this
regulations (50 USC Par. 1881, or "FISA 702"), are subject to surveillance by the

US intelligence. As can be seen from the "Snowden Slides" and from the
Google Transparency Report, this entity is actively providing data
personal data to the US government under that precept.

- The controller and Google have continued to rely on the "EU-US Privacy Shield" and on
the standard data protection clauses for the aforementioned transfers

of data.

 Therefore, it requests that the claim be fully investigated and that the following be established:
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/15

 1. What personal data was transferred from the controller to Google LLC in
 USA or any other third country and international organization.

 2. In which transfer mechanism under article 44 et seq. of the

 GDPR the controller based this data transfer.

 3. If the provisions of the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the
 new Conditions for the treatment of data of Google Ads in its current version
 and with effect from 08/31/2020 they comply with the requirements of article 28 GDPR
 regarding the transfer of personal data to third countries.

 4. Immediately impose a ban or suspension of any
 flow of data to Google LLC in the USA and order the return of that data to the
 EU/EEA or to another country offering adequate protection under Articles
 58(2)(d), (f) and (j) GDPR.

 5. That an administrative fine be imposed on the person responsible and on Google.

GDPR. Requests that the facts be investigated, that the RAE data flow be prohibited
against Google LLC in the US, and that a fine be imposed on RAE and Google LLC.

treatment carried out, addressed both to the data controller and to Google.

The will of all data protection control authorities is the cessation
of the flow of data to third countries without the guarantees established in the GDPR.
