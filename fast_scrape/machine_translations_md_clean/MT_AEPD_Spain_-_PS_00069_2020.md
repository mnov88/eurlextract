## English Summary

### Facts

On 23 October 2019, a complaint was lodged before a court relating to the fact that the personal data of users have been falsified by Lycamobile or a mobile telephone establishment authorized by that entity.

The personal data of the users of the prepaid cards which are registered in the Lycamobile register do not correspond to the data of the person who acquires the prepaid mobile phone card.

In addition, it was indicated that the use of the personal data of a third person that is not related to the facts stated in the complaint, has caused the complainant serious non-consensual patrimonial harm.

On 17 March 2020, the AEPD initiated the sanctioning procedure, transferred the documents to the defendant, and the latter sent allegations.

### Dispute

Is the use of personal data without the consent of the persons concerned a breach of Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD considered that the defendant company carried out the treatment without having any legitimacy to do so. The personal data were incorporated into the company's information systems, without it being proven that the company had legitimately contracted, had its consent to the collection and subsequent processing of its personal data, or that there was any other cause that made the processing carried out lawful.

In setting the amount of the penalty, the AEPD took into account: the link between the business activity of the respondent and the processing of personal data (83 (2) (k) GDPR); the fact that basic personal identifiers are affected (83 (2) (g) GDPR); the intentionality or negligence of the infringement (83 (2) (b) GDPR) and the lack of cooperation with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (83 (2) (f) GDPR).

Therefore, in view of the aggravating factors applied to the case, the Director of the Spanish DPA imposed a penalty of EUR 60000 on the company Lycamobile S.L.

LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

I
By virtue of the powers conferred on each of the parties by Article 58(2) of the GDPR authority, and in accordance with the provisions of Articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

II
Article 6, Lawfulness of processing, of the GPDR, establishes that "Processing shall only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met conditions:
a) the data subject has given his consent to the processing of his data for one or more specific purposes;
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the interested is a party to or for the application at his request of measures pre-contractual;
(…)”
Article 4 of the GPRS, Definitions, in paragraph 11, states that "(11) "Consent of the data subject" means any expression of free will specific, informed and unequivocal by which the data subject accepts, either by
a statement or clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that concern him".
Also Article 6, Treatment based on the consent of the person concerned, of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on Data Protection Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), states
that:
"In accordance with Article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the consent of the person concerned is understood as an expression of will specific, informed and unequivocal reason why he accepts, either by a

3. The execution of the contract may not be subordinated to the consent of the person concerned to
processing of personal data for purposes unrelated to the maintenance, development, or control of the contractual relationship".

Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of "the principles for treatment, including conditions for consent under the of Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9" is punishable, in accordance with Article
mentioned in Article 83 of that Regulation, "with administrative fines of 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, an equivalent amount to a maximum of 4% of the total annual turnover for the financial previous year, opting for the one with the highest amount".

In particular, the following:
(…)
b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing laid down in Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(…)”

III

The personal data were incorporated into the information systems of the company, without proof of legitimate employment,
