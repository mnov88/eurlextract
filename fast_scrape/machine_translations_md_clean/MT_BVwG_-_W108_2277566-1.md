## English Summary

### Facts

On 27 June 2022, the District Court issued a request to the controller — a statutory social insurance carrier — asking for the name and address of the therapy facility where the data subject was undergoing rehabilitation. The request was part of ongoing enforcement proceedings against the data subject. The controller received this request on 11 July 2022.

Relying on its statutory duty to provide administrative assistance under Section 360(1) ASVG, in conjunction with Section 129 B-KUVG and Section 89h GOG, the controller disclosed the name and address of the rehabilitation center. The duration of the data subject’s stay had already been communicated to the court separately.

On 30 August 2022, the controller informed the data subject in writing about the data disclosure and explained the legal basis for this action. The controller argued that the request did not appear to exceed the court’s lawful authority and that only minimal and necessary data had been shared. Moreover, the controller maintained that if the information disclosed qualified as special category data under [Article 9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#1 "Article 9 GDPR"), the disclosure was nonetheless lawful pursuant to [Article 9(2)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2f "Article 9 GDPR"), which permits processing necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or judicial activities.

On 10 January 2023, the data subject filed a complaint with DPA under [Article 77 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_77_GDPR "Article 77 GDPR") and Section 24 DSG. The data subject alleged a violation of the right to confidentiality under Section 1 DSG and [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), asserting that the controller had unlawfully transferred sensitive health-related data to the court without a proper legal basis or consent. The data subject emphasized that the location of the rehabilitation facility could allow for inferences about health status, and that the controller failed to clarify exactly what data had been transferred despite multiple requests for access.

At the request of the DPA, the controller submitted a response on 17 February 2023, reaffirming that the data transfer had been lawful, limited in scope, and in compliance with judicial cooperation obligations under Austrian law. The controller denied that there had been a breach of confidentiality, citing both domestic provisions and [Article 9(2)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2f "Article 9 GDPR") as legal justification.

On 28 February 2023, the data subject submitted a rebuttal, arguing that the court’s request lacked legal grounding, especially within the context of enforcement proceedings, and that the controller had an obligation to critically assess the legitimacy of the request. According to the data subject, the controller should have at minimum requested clarification from the court or sought consent prior to disclosure.

In its decision, the DPA dismissed the complaint as unfounded pursuant to Section 24(5) DSG. It held that while the right to confidentiality under Section 1 DSG is constitutionally protected, it may be lawfully restricted where overriding legitimate interests exist, provided such restrictions are based on statutory provisions and are consistent with Article 8(2) ECHR. The DPA concluded that the controller had acted within its legal duties under Section 360(1) ASVG and that no obvious unlawfulness was evident in the court’s request. Even if the data disclosed were considered health data, the DPA held that the disclosure was permissible under [Article 9(2)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2f "Article 9 GDPR"), as part of judicial proceedings.

The data subject appealed the DPA’s decision to the Federal Administrative Court, reiterating that the controller failed to properly review the request or take appropriate safeguards. The data subject maintained that disclosure of the rehabilitation facility’s name inherently revealed sensitive health information, and that neither legal justification nor informed consent had been validly established. The appeal sought annulment of the decision and full recognition of a violation of data protection rights.

### Holding

The Federal Administrative Court dismissed the appeal. It held that the proceedings solely concerned whether the controller had violated the data subject’s right to confidentiality under Section 1 DSG. Other issues raised — including the controller’s alleged failure to provide information under Articles 12 et seq. GDPR or the lawfulness of the district court’s data request — were not within the scope of this proceeding.

The Court first established that the information disclosed — namely, the fact that the data subject was undergoing treatment at a rehabilitation facility specializing in mental and psychiatric care — constituted health data under [Article 4(15) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#15 "Article 4 GDPR"). In line with guidance from the former Article 29 Working Party and national jurisprudence, it emphasized that indirect inferences about health status (e.g., from a facility’s specialization) suffice for classification as sensitive data under [Article 9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#1 "Article 9 GDPR").

Despite this classification, the Court found the disclosure justified. It acknowledged that limitations to the right to confidentiality under Section 1 DSG may be lawful where grounded in statutory provisions and where the processing respects the principles set out in the GDPR, particularly [Article 5 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). In this case, the processing was found lawful under [Article 9(2)(g) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2g "Article 9 GDPR"), which permits the processing of special category data where necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of Member State law, provided appropriate safeguards are in place.

The Court further held that the controller’s actions satisfied the legality conditions under Article 6(1)(c) and (e) GDPR. The data processing was necessary to fulfill a legal obligation under Section 360(1) ASVG and to perform a public interest task under Section 89h GOG, both of which required the controller to respond to a court order by providing the data subject’s whereabouts.

Importantly, the Court found no indication that the controller exceeded the scope of the court’s request. Only the necessary data — the name and address of the facility — were disclosed, and only to the court. This aligned with the data minimization principle in [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"). Since the data subject had failed to provide an alternative contact address during their rehabilitation period, the court’s request was considered neither excessive nor unlawful, and the controller could reasonably assume its legality.

Finally, the Court rejected the data subject’s reliance on CJEU case C-252/21, finding it irrelevant to the context, which involved public authorities fulfilling statutory obligations rather than commercial processing.

The Court held that the controller lawfully disclosed the data subject’s sensitive personal data in compliance with both national procedural law and the GDPR. As such, no violation of the right to confidentiality under Section 1 DSG, or of [Article 9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#1 "Article 9 GDPR"), had occurred. The appeal was therefore dismissed.

Text

Reasons for the decision:

I. Course of proceedings and facts: roman one. Proceedings and Facts:

1. In the data protection complaint filed with the Data Protection Authority (the respondent authority before the Federal Administrative Court) pursuant to Article 77 GDPR and Section 24 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) on January 10, 2023 (as amended by a submission dated January 23, 2023), the complainant alleged a violation of the right to confidentiality pursuant to Section 1 DSG and Article 9 GDPR by the now co-participating party, an insurance carrier (XXXX; former respondent in the proceedings before the respondent authority). 1. In the data protection complaint filed with the Data Protection Authority (the respondent authority before the Federal Administrative Court) pursuant to Article 77 of the GDPR and Section 24 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) of January 10, 2023 (as amended by a submission of January 23, 2023), the complainant alleged a violation of his right to confidentiality pursuant to Section 1 of the DSG and Article 9 of the GDPR by the now co-participating party, an insurance provider (Roman 40; the former respondent in the proceedings before the respondent authority).

In this regard, the complainant argued that from XXXX to XXXX, he was on a rehabilitation stay in XXXX, in building XXXX, approved by the co-participating party. The co-participating party unlawfully transmitted information about his whereabouts during this stay to the District Court of XXXX (hereinafter: District Court). It was none of the District Court judge's business where he specifically spent his rehabilitation, as his medical conditions could easily be deduced from the location of his rehabilitation stay and his knowledge of the rehabilitation facility of the co-participating party. The exact personal data that the co-participating party had provided to the judge has been concealed from him to this day, even though he had already submitted corresponding written requests for information. He requested a declaration of a violation of his right to confidentiality. In this regard, the complainant argued that from 1940 to 1945 he was in the building at 1940 in Roman 40 on a rehabilitation stay approved by the co-participating party. The co-participating party had unlawfully transmitted information about his whereabouts during this stay to the District Court in Roman 40 (hereinafter: District Court). It is none of the district court judge's business where he specifically undergoes his rehabilitation, as his medical conditions can be easily and effortlessly deduced from the location of his rehabilitation stay and the co-participating party's knowledge of the rehabilitation facility. The exact personal data that the co-participating party provided to the judge has been concealed from him to this day, even though he has already submitted corresponding written requests for information. He requests a declaration of a violation of his right to confidentiality.

2. At the request of the authority concerned, the co-participating party submitted a statement on the complainant's data protection complaint on February 17, 2023, stating that, contrary to his statements, the complainant had demonstrably been informed several times about the fact, reason, and extent of the disclosure of his personal data. Following a request from the District Court in case number XXXX dated June 27, 2022 (received on July 11, 2022) to disclose the health resort where the complainant stayed from XXXX to XXXX, the co-participating party provided the court with the address of this facility. The following data was disclosed: "Therapy Center XXXX." The court had already been informed of the duration of the stay. The co-participating party provided this data due to its obligation to provide administrative assistance pursuant to Section 360 ASVG in conjunction with Section 129 B-KUVG and Section 89h GOG. In a letter dated August 30, 2022, the co-participating party explained the data disclosure to the complainant, along with legal explanations. In any case, the co-participating party did not perceive the court's request as an obvious overstepping of its authority, and by only disclosing the address of the place of residence, the co-participating party did not transmit excessive data. If it can be assumed that information about a person's spa stay is to be considered health data, Art. 9 (2) (f) GDPR is applicable, which permits processing if it is "necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for actions by the courts in the exercise of their judicial activity." The co-participating party had no reason to doubt that the court's request was made in the course of its judicial activity and that it had to be complied with in accordance with Section 89h of the German Court of Justice Act (GOG). The address data was therefore passed on to the requesting court lawfully and in compliance with data protection regulations. In the co-participating party's view, the complainant's right to confidentiality of his personal data was therefore not violated. 2. At the request of the authority concerned, the co-participating party submitted a statement on the complainant's data protection complaint on February 17, 2023, stating that, contrary to his statements, the complainant had demonstrably been informed several times about the fact, reason, and extent of the disclosure of his personal data. Following the District Court's request in case number roman 40, dated June 27, 2022 (received on July 11, 2022), to disclose the health resort where the complainant had stayed between roman 40 and roman 40, the co-participating party provided the court with the address of this facility. The following data was disclosed: "Therapy Center roman 40." The court had already been informed of the duration of the stay. The co-participating party provided this data due to its obligation to provide administrative assistance pursuant to Section 360 of the General Social Insurance Act (ASVG) in conjunction with Section 129 of the Federal Act on the Protection of Personal Data (B-KUVG) and Section 89h of the General Administrative Court Act (GOG). In a letter dated August 30, 2022, the co-participating party explained the data transfer to the complainant, including legal arguments. In any case, the co-participating party did not perceive the court's request as an obvious overstepping of its authority, and by only disclosing the address of the place of residence, the co-participating party did not transmit excessive data. If it can be assumed that information about a person's spa stay is to be considered health data, Article 9, paragraph 2, letter f, GDPR is applicable, which permits processing if it is "necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for actions by the courts in the course of their judicial activities." The co-participating party had no reason to doubt that the court's request was made within the scope of its judicial activities and that it had to be complied with in accordance with Section 89h, GOG. The address data was therefore passed on to the requesting court lawfully and in compliance with data protection regulations. From the point of view of the co-participating party, the complainant’s right to confidentiality of his personal data was therefore not violated.Attached to the statement were letters from the co-participating party to the complainant dated July 27, 2022, and August 30, 2022, as well as the note from District Court XXXX dated June 27, 2022, reference number XXXX. Attached to the statement were letters from the co-participating party to the complainant dated July 27, 2022, and August 30, 2022, as well as the note from District Court Roman 40 dated June 27, 2022, reference number Roman 40.

3. The complainant responded to this in his statement dated February 28, 2023, after being granted the opportunity to be heard as a party regarding the results of the investigation. Summarizing this, the complainant argued that the District Court's note was manifestly unlawful because it contained no reference to any law. This was an enforcement proceeding, and the Enforcement Act did not contain any authorization to determine which sanatorium a patient was currently staying at. This information was also completely irrelevant for enforcement proceedings. This completely unlawful action by the district court judge was clearly evident to the co-participating party, who therefore should not have complied with the request in the note.

4. In the now contested decision of the respondent authority, the complainant's data protection complaint was dismissed as unfounded.

The respondent authority initially stated that the subject matter of the appeal was the question of whether the co-participating party had violated the complainant's right to confidentiality by disclosing the complainant's whereabouts during his rehabilitation stay to the district court.

The respondent authority made the following findings of fact:

"Enforcement proceedings against the complainant are pending before District Court XXXX, case number XXXX. "Enforcement proceedings against the complainant are pending before District Court Roman 40, case number 40.

From XXXX to XXXX, the complainant was in a rehabilitation stay at the XXXX Therapy Center, approved by the respondent \[co-participating party\].

From XXXX to XXXX, the complainant was in a rehabilitation stay at the Roman 40 Therapy Center, approved by the respondent \[co-participating party\].

On June 27, 2022, District Court XXXX sent the following note to the respondent \[co-participating party\].

On June 27, 2022, District Court XXXX sent the following note to the respondent \[co-participating party\]. addressed to:

The respondent \[co-participating party\] has complied with the request of the XXXX District Court and has provided the following information to the XXXX District Court:

"Therapy Center XXXX." "Therapy Center Roman 40."

The respondent authority held that the fundamental right to data protection enshrined in Section 1 of the Data Protection Act (DSG), according to the first paragraph of which everyone, in particular with regard to respect for their private and family life, has the right to confidentiality of personal data concerning them, insofar as there is a legitimate interest in doing so, includes the protection of the data subject against the collection of their data and the disclosure of the data collected about them. However, the fundamental right to data protection is not absolute, but may be restricted by certain permissible interventions. According to Section 1 Paragraph 2 of the Data Protection Act, restrictions on the right to confidentiality, insofar as the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the data subject or with their consent, are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another, whereby interventions by a state authority may only be carried out on the basis of laws that are necessary for the reasons stated in Article 8 Paragraph 2 of the ECHR. The respondent authority held that the fundamental right to data protection enshrined in Section 1 of the Data Protection Act, according to the first paragraph of which everyone, particularly with regard to respect for his private and family life, has a right to confidentiality of personal data concerning him, insofar as there is a legitimate interest in doing so, including the protection of the data subject against the collection of his data and the disclosure of the data collected about him. However, the fundamental right to data protection is not absolute, but may be limited by certain permissible interventions. According to paragraph 1, paragraph 2, of the Data Protection Act, restrictions on the right to confidentiality, insofar as the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the data subject or with his consent, are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another person. In the case of interventions by a state authority, these may only be based on laws that are necessary for the reasons stated in Article 8, paragraph 2, of the ECHR.

According to Section 360, paragraph 1, of the General Social Insurance Act (ASVG), administrative authorities and courts are obligated to comply with requests from insurance carriers and the umbrella organization addressed to them in the implementation of this federal law, within the scope of their subject-matter and local jurisdiction. Similarly, Insurance carriers (the umbrella association) are obliged to provide administrative assistance to the administrative authorities and the courts. Pursuant to Section 360, Paragraph 1, of the General Social Insurance Act (ASVG), the administrative authorities and the courts are obliged to comply with requests from the insurance carriers and the umbrella association made to them in the implementation of this federal law within the scope of their subject-matter and local jurisdiction. Likewise, the insurance carriers (the umbrella association) are obliged to provide administrative assistance to the administrative authorities and the courts.

As established, the co-participating party complied with the district court's enforcement request of June 27, 2022, for disclosure of the complainant's whereabouts and informed the court that the complainant was completing his rehabilitation stay at the XXXX therapy center.As established, the co-participating party complied with the district court's enforcement request of June 27, 2022, for disclosure of the complainant's whereabouts and informed the court that the complainant was completing his rehabilitation stay at the Roman therapy center. 40.

To the extent that the co-participating party has argued in this regard that the transmission of the data was covered by the provision of Section 360, Paragraph 1 of the General Social Insurance Act (ASVG), this cannot be refuted in the opinion of the respondent authority. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that, contrary to the complainant's opinion, it is not apparent from the District Court's memorandum that this was unlawful, and it is also true that the co-participating party is of the opinion that, in connection with the District Court's memorandum, no obvious exceeding of its authority could be assumed.

Regarding the complainant's argument that the District Court could easily and effortlessly deduce his medical conditions from the location of his rehabilitation stay and the knowledge of the rehabilitation facility of the co-participating party, thus qualifying the address of the therapy center XXXX as health data, it should be pointed out that even if one were to follow the complainant's argument, the processing in the present case would have been permissible under Art. 9 (1) (g) GDPR in conjunction with Section 360 (1) ASVG.

Against this background, the complaint pursuant to Section 24, paragraph 5, DSG proved to be unfounded and therefore had to be dismissed. Against this background, the complaint pursuant to Section 24, paragraph 5, DSG proved to be unfounded and therefore had to be dismissed.

5. The complainant filed a timely party complaint against this decision with the Federal Administrative Court pursuant to Article 130, paragraph 1, item 1, B-VG, in which he repeated his arguments from the administrative proceedings and summarized that the co-participating party had not conducted any kind of review of the court request, although an exceeding of its powers was clearly evident even to non-lawyers. The co-participating party should have asked the district court judge on what legal basis it relied. or even support their written note. The co-participating party had failed to do so, just as it had failed to inquire with him, at least by telephone, whether he agreed to the disclosure of the location of the rehabilitation facility. Obligated parties in enforcement proceedings are only obliged to provide information regarding their permanently registered place of residence and date of birth. It is therefore requested that the appeal be upheld and that his data protection complaint be fully complied with; alternatively, an application for annulment is filed. 5.

It is therefore requested that the appeal be upheld and that his data protection complaint be fully complied with; alternatively, a motion for annulment is filed.

6. The respondent authority did not exercise its right to a preliminary decision on the appeal and submitted the appeal, along with the relevant files of the administrative proceedings, to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision, defending the contested decision.

7. The Federal Administrative Court forwarded the appeal to the co-participating party by way of a notification of appeal pursuant to Section 10 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG) for information and comment.

8. On September 8, 2023, the co-participating party submitted a statement on the complainant's party appeal, in which it referred to the clear and legally correct decision of the respondent authority and stated that the allegation of unlawful conduct by the co-participating party was thus clearly refuted by the statements made by the respondent authority in the contested decision. It is requested that the appeal be dismissed.

9. The complainant responded to the co-participating party's statement in a submission dated June 12, 2024, essentially repeating his previous statements and arguing that the co-participating party had clearly violated the GDPR within the meaning of the ECJ judgment in Case C-252/21. As a public institution, the co-participating party had the opportunity at any time, but also the legal obligation, to obtain the execution act before making its decision on data transfer – which it considered unnecessary, contrary to the GDPR. If the Federal Administrative Court still has any doubts as to whether the written note of June 27, 2022, justifies an exception to the GDPR, it should refer the relevant question to the ECJ. The co-participating party would also have had an obligation to inform him at the time his personal data was disclosed and to inform him of the legitimate interests pursued. In the event that the Federal Administrative Court does not assume from the outset that the landmark decision of the ECJ C-252/21 clearly demonstrates that the co-participating party has violated the GDPR in a serious manner and to the detriment of one of its insured persons, a public and oral hearing before the Federal Administrative Court is requested for cautiary reasons.

II. The Federal Administrative Court considered: Roman II. The Federal Administrative Court considered:

1. Findings:

The explanations above under point I. regarding the course of the proceedings (administrative proceedings) and the facts of the case, in particular the findings of the authority concerned in the contested decision, are used as a basis. The explanations above under point Roman 1. The procedural process (administrative activity) and the facts of the case, in particular the findings of the respondent authority in the contested decision, were taken as a basis.

2. Assessment of Evidence:

The findings are derived from the submitted administrative files and the court file in question, in particular from the contested decision. The factual circumstances relevant to the decision have been clarified, and the relevant investigation results and documents are contained in the submitted administrative files. The respondent authority conducted a flawless, proper investigation and correctly established the relevant facts in the grounds for the contested decision, in accordance with the available documents. The complainant did not challenge these facts and the assessment of evidence in his party appeal, or did so with merely unsubstantiated arguments. However, the facts relevant to the decision are thus established. Therefore, there is no need for further clarification of the facts by taking additional evidence and conducting an oral hearing.

3. Legal Assessment:

Regarding A)

3.3.1.3. Article 6 of the GDPR reads in part:

"Lawfulness of processing

(1) Processing shall only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:

a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for one or more specific purposes;

e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;

f) the processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, except where such interests override the interests or fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data prevail, in particular where the data subject is a child.

Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.

(2) Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for the purpose of complying with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by specifying more precisely specific processing requirements and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, including for other specific processing situations as referred to in Chapter IX.

(3) The legal basis for processing operations referred to in points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be established by

a) Union law or

b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.

The purpose of the processing must be specified in that legal basis or, with regard to the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation, including provisions on the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller, the types of data processed, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which and for what purposes the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitation, the storage period, and the processing operations and procedures that may be applied, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, such as those for other specific processing situations referred to in Chapter IX. Union or Member State law must pursue an objective in the public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate purpose pursued. The purpose of the processing must be specified in that legal basis or, with regard to the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1 is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. This legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of the provisions of this Regulation, including provisions on the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller, the types of data processed, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which and for what purposes the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitation, the storage period, and the processing operations and procedures that may be used, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, such as those for other specific processing situations pursuant to Chapter IX of this Regulation. Union or Member State law must pursue an objective in the public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate purpose pursued.

3.3.1.4. Article 9(1) and (2)(g) GDPR read:

(1) The processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, as well as the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health, or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation, shall be prohibited.

(2) Paragraph 1 shall not apply in the following cases:

(g) processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of Union or Member State law which is proportionate to the aim pursued, respects the essence of the right to data protection and provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject.

3.3.1.5. Section 1, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Data Protection Act read: 3.3.1.5. Paragraph 1, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Data Protection Act read:

"(1) Everyone has the right to confidentiality of personal data concerning him or her, in particular with regard to respect for his or her private and family life, provided that there is a legitimate interest in doing so. The existence of such an interest is excluded if data is not subject to a right of confidentiality due to its general availability or its inability to trace back to the data subject.

(2) To the extent that the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the data subject or with his or her consent, restrictions on the right to confidentiality are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another person; in the case of interventions by a state authority, this right is only permissible on the basis of laws resulting from the reasons listed in Art.8 (2) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), Federal Law Gazette No. 210/1958. Such laws may only provide for the use of data that, by their nature, merits special protection to safeguard important public interests and must, at the same time, establish appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality interests of those affected. Even in the case of permissible restrictions, the interference with the fundamental right may only be carried out in the mildest way that achieves the objective. (2) Unless the use of personal data is in the vital interest of the data subject or with their consent, restrictions on the right to confidentiality are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another person. In the case of interference by a state authority, this may only be permitted on the basis of laws that are necessary for the reasons stated in Article 8, paragraph 2, of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), Federal Law Gazette No. 210 of 1958. Such laws may only provide for the use of data that, by their nature, are particularly worthy of protection to protect important public interests and must simultaneously establish appropriate safeguards for the protection of the data subject's interests in confidentiality. Even in the case of permissible restrictions, the interference with the fundamental right may only be carried out in the mildest way that achieves the objective.

3.3.1.6. Section 360, Paragraph 1 of the General Social Insurance Act (ASVG), including the heading, reads: 3.3.1.6. Section 360, Paragraph 1 of the General Social Insurance Act (ASVG), including the heading, reads:

"Legal and Administrative Assistance

Section 360 (1) Administrative authorities and courts are obligated to comply with requests from insurance carriers and the umbrella organization made to them in the implementation of this federal law, within the scope of their subject-matter and local jurisdiction. Likewise, the insurance carriers (the umbrella organization) must provide administrative assistance to the administrative authorities and courts."

Section 360, (1) Administrative authorities and courts are obligated to comply with requests from insurance carriers and the umbrella organization made to them in the implementation of this federal law, within the scope of their subject-matter and local jurisdiction. Likewise, the insurance carriers (the umbrella organization) must provide administrative assistance to the administrative authorities and courts." 3.3.1.7. Section 89h of the Court Organization Act (GOG) reads, including its heading:

"Administrative Assistance of Social Insurance Institutions

"The social insurance institutions and their main associations must, upon request, provide the courts with information on circumstances relevant to the proceedings; the requests and information must be made with the aid of automated means, if possible (Section 31, Paragraph 4, Item 3, Letter b, ASVG). Provisions that stipulate specific requirements for certain proceedings remain unaffected.""The social insurance institutions and their main associations must, upon request, provide the courts with information on circumstances relevant to the proceedings; the requests and information must, if possible, be made with the aid of automated means, if possible (Section 31, Paragraph 4, Item 3, Letter b, ASVG). Provisions that stipulate specific requirements for certain proceedings remain unaffected."

3.3.1.8. Section 120 of the Civil Servants' Health and Accident Insurance Act (B-KUVG) reads:

With regard to the procedure for implementing this federal law, Part Seven of the General Social Security Act applies, provided that:

1. A notice shall be issued in any case regarding the application for the award or the official determination of any other benefit from the accident insurance of public employees - except for a benefit pursuant to Section 88, Paragraph 1, Letter b;

1. A notice shall be issued in any case regarding the application for the award or the official determination of any other benefit from the accident insurance of public employees - except for a benefit pursuant to Section 88, Paragraph 1, Letter b; 2. Section 414, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the General Social Insurance Act (ASVG) does not apply." 2. Section 414, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the General Social Insurance Act (ASVG) does not apply."

3.3.2. Applied to the present case, this means the following:

3.3.2.1. It should be noted that the subject matter of these appeal proceedings is (solely) whether the co-participating party violated the complainant's right to data protection or confidentiality pursuant to Section 1 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) by disclosing the complainant's whereabouts during his rehabilitation stay to the district court. 3.3.2.1. It should be noted that the subject matter of these appeal proceedings is (solely) whether the co-participating party violated the complainant's right to data protection or confidentiality pursuant to Section 1 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) by disclosing the complainant's whereabouts during his rehabilitation stay to the district court.

The subject matter of the proceedings is therefore not the question of whether – as alleged by the complainant in his party complaint – the co-participating party violated its duty to provide information pursuant to Art. 12 et seq. GDPR, nor whether the district court can be blamed for a data protection violation by requiring the disclosure of the complainant's whereabouts. With regard to the latter, it should be noted that this matter was already the subject of the pending proceedings under case number W176 2281424-1, whereby the complainant's party complaint was dismissed as unfounded by a decision of August 21, 2024, with the proviso that the data protection complaint regarding the respondent, District Court XXXX, is dismissed as inadmissible. The subject matter of these proceedings is therefore not the question of whether – as alleged by the complainant in his party complaint – the co-participating party violated its duty to provide information pursuant to Articles 12 et seq. of the GDPR, nor whether the district court can be held responsible for a data protection violation by requiring the disclosure of the complainant's whereabouts. With regard to the latter, it should be noted that this matter was already the subject of the pending proceedings under case number W176 2281424-1, whereby the complainant's party complaint was dismissed as unfounded by a decision of August 21, 2024, with the proviso that the data protection complaint regarding the respondent, the District Court of Rome 40, is dismissed as inadmissible.

3.3.2.2. First, it should be noted that the information that the complainant is staying at the XXXX therapy center, which specializes in the treatment of mental and psychiatric illnesses, constitutes "health data" within the meaning of Art. 4(15) GDPR. The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party has already stated that, for example, data on membership in a patient support group (e.g., a cancer support group) should be qualified as sensitive health data (Kastelitz/Hötzendorfer/Tschohl in Knyrim, DatKomm Art. 9 GDPR, para. 28 \[as of May 7, 2020, rdb.at\]). Even under the provisions of the GDPR, temporary or permanent stays in special facilities (e.g., AIDS, cancer, health resort, psychosocial residential group) fall under this protection (Weichert in Kühling/Buchner, General Data Protection Regulation4, Art. 4 No. 15 GDPR, para. 2). This is also consistent with the case law of the Administrative Court, according to which an indirect emergence of sensitive information or indirect references to sensitive characteristics are sufficient for the applicability of Art. 9 (1) GDPR (cf. VwGH 17.05.2024, Ra 2023/04/0005, para. 30; 14.12.2021, Ro 2021/04/0007; cf. also ECJ 01.08.2022, C-184/20, Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija). 3.3.2.2. First of all, it should be noted that the information that the complainant is staying at the therapy center Römische 40, which specializes in the treatment of mental and psychiatric illnesses, constitutes "health data" within the meaning of Article 4, paragraph 15, GDPR. The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party has already stated that, for example, data on membership in a patient support group (e.g., a cancer support group) should be classified as sensitive health data (Kastelitz/Hötzendorfer/Tschohl in Knyrim, DatKomm Article 9, GDPR para. 28 \[as of May 7, 2020, rdb.at\]). Even under the provisions of the GDPR, temporary or permanent stays in special facilities (e.g., AIDS, cancer, health resort, psychosocial residential group) fall under this protection (Weichert in Kühling/Buchner, General Data Protection Regulation4, Article 4, No. 15 GDPR, para. 2). This is also consistent with the case law of the Administrative Court, according to which an indirect emergence of sensitive information or indirect references to sensitive characteristics are sufficient for the applicability of Article 9(1) GDPR (see Administrative Court decisions of May 17, 2024, Ra 2023/04/0005, para. 30; December 14, 2021, Ro 2021/04/0007; see also ECJ decision of August 1, 2022, C-184/20, Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija).

3.3.2.3. In view of the established facts, the rejection of the complainant's data protection complaint by the competent authority in the contested decision was (nevertheless) justified:

3.3.2.3.1. A permissible limitation of the right to confidentiality under Section 1 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) generally arises from the second paragraph of this provision; however, the GDPR and, in particular, the principles enshrined therein (in Article 5 GDPR) must be taken into account when interpreting the right to confidentiality (see Thiele/Wagner, Practical Commentary on the Data Protection Act \[DSG\]² Section 1, margin number 39 \[as of February 1, 2022, rdb.at\]). 3.3.2.3.1. A permissible limitation of the right to confidentiality under Paragraph 1 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) generally arises from the second paragraph of this provision; however, the GDPR and, in particular, the principles enshrined therein (in Article 5 GDPR) must be taken into account when interpreting the right to confidentiality (see Thiele/Wagner, Practical Commentary on the Data Protection Act \[DSG\]² Paragraph 1, margin number 39 \[as of February 1, 2022, rdb.at\]).

Article 5 GDPR sets out the principles for the processing of personal data (principle of lawfulness, fairness, transparency \[Article 5 (1) (a)\], purpose limitation principle \[Article 5 (1) (b)\], data minimization principle \[Article 5 (1) (c)\], accuracy principle \[Article 5 (1) (d)\], storage limitation principle \[Article 5 (1) (e)\], integrity and confidentiality principle \[Article 5 (1) (f)\], accountability principle \[Article 5 (2)\], cf. Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 5 GDPR \[as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at\]). Article 5 GDPR sets out the principles for the processing of personal data (principle of lawfulness, fairness, transparency \[Article 5 (1) (a)\], principle Purpose limitation \[Article 5(1)(b)\], Principle of data minimization \[Article 5(1)(c)\], Principle of accuracy \[Article 5(1)(d)\], Principle of storage limitation \[Article 5(1)(e)\], Principle of integrity and confidentiality \[Article 5(1)(f)\], Principle of accountability \[Article 5(2)\], cf. Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 5, GDPR \[as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at\]).

The requirements for lawful processing of health data are specified in Article 9(2) GDPR. In the present case, the justification provided for in Article 9(2)(g) GDPR is relevant, according to which processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of Union or Member State law that is proportionate to the objective pursued, respects the essence of the right to data protection, and provides for appropriate and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject. The requirements for lawful processing of health data are specified in Article 9(2) GDPR. In the present case, the justification provided for in Article 9(2)(g) GDPR is relevant, according to which processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of Union or Member State law that is proportionate to the objective pursued, respects the essence of the right to data protection, and provides for appropriate and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject.

This means that the use of (sensitive) data in accordance with procedural laws is (continued) also permissible from a data protection perspective (cf. Supreme Court of Justice, November 27, 2019, 6Nc30/19t; see also Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation, para. 61 on Art. 6 GDPR \[as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at\]). This means that the use of (sensitive) data in accordance with procedural laws is (continued) also permissible from a data protection perspective (cf. Supreme Court of Justice, November 27, 2019, 6Nc30/19t; see also Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation, para. 61 on Article 6 GDPR \[as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at\]).

Furthermore, according to the case law of the ECJ, processing of, for example, health data based on Article 9 (2) (a) to (h) GDPR is only lawful if it complies with both the requirements arising from this provision and the obligations arising from Article 5 (1) (a) and Article 6 (1) GDPR and, in particular, fulfils one of the legality requirements set out in Article 6 (1) GDPR (cf. ECJ 21.12.2023, C-667/21, Krankenversicherung Nordrhein, paras 76-79). However, it is not necessary for the justifying legal basis to identify the disputed data processing itself (cf. VwGH 21.12.2023, Ro 2021/04/0010 with reference to ECJ C-136/17). According to the case law of the ECJ, processing of, for example, health data based on Article 9, paragraph 2, letters a to h GDPR is only lawful if it complies with both the requirements arising from this provision and the obligations arising from Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a and Article 6, paragraph 1, GDPR and, in particular, fulfills one of the legality requirements set out in Article 6, paragraph 1, GDPR (cf. ECJ 21.12.2023, C-667/21, Krankenversicherung Nordrhein, paras 76-79). However, it is not necessary for the justifying legal basis to identify the disputed data processing itself (cf. VwGH 21.12.2023, Ro 2021/04/0010 with reference to ECJ C-136/17).

In the present case, the justifications under Article 6 (1) (c) and Article 6 (1) (e) GDPR apply.

According to Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR, the processing of data is lawful, among other things, if the processing is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation to which the controller is subject. According to Article 6 (1) (e) GDPR, this is also the case if processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. According to Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR, the processing of data is lawful, among other things, if processing is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation to which the controller is subject. According to Article 6 (1) (e) GDPR, this is also the case if processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

3.3.2.3.2. Against this legal background, however, a violation of the right to confidentiality pursuant to Section 1 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) by the co-participating party cannot be assumed in the present case because the disclosure of the complainant's (albeit sensitive) data by the co-participating party to the court, which is the subject of the complaint, was made in accordance with a court order (note of the district court dated June 27, 2022, which, as the complainant himself points out, is a court act \[a decision, cf. Section 425 of the Code of Civil Procedure\]) and was justified under data protection law due to a legal (statutory) obligation incumbent on the co-participating party or to perform a task in the substantial public interest within the meaning of Section 360 (1) of the General Social Security Act (ASVG) in conjunction with Section 89h of the General Administrative Court Act (GOG). According to this provision, the co-participating party was entitled and obliged to disclose the complainant's whereabouts to the district court based on the order. It cannot be seen that the co-participating party acted excessively or went beyond the court order. Rather, it merely provided the data requested by the court in its note (its decision) and disclosed these only to the court. Thus, it disclosed the complainant's data only to the extent ordered and necessary, thus complying with the principle of data minimization in Art. 5 (1) (c) GDPR. The complainant also does not argue that the actions of the co-participating party subject to the complaint did not comply with the wording of the court order. 3.3.2.3.2. Against this legal background, however, a violation of the right to confidentiality pursuant to Section 1 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) by the co-participating party cannot be assumed in the present case because the disclosure of the complainant's (albeit sensitive) data by the co-participating party to the court, which is the subject of the complaint, was made in accordance with a court order (note of the district court dated June 27, 2022, which, as the complainant himself points out, is a court act \[a decision, see Section 425 of the Code of Civil Procedure\]) and was justified under data protection law due to a legal (statutory) obligation incumbent on the co-participating party or to perform a task in the substantial public interest within the meaning of Section 360, Paragraph 1 of the General Social Security Act (ASVG) in conjunction with Section 89h of the General Social Security Act (GOG). According to this provision, the co-participating party was entitled and obliged to disclose the complainant's whereabouts to the district court based on the order. It cannot be seen that the co-participating party acted excessively or went beyond the court order. Rather, it merely disclosed the data requested by the court in its note (its decision) and disclosed these data only to the court. Thus, it disclosed the complainant's data only to the extent ordered and necessary, thus complying with the principle of data minimization in Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c, GDPR. The complainant also does not argue that the actions of the co-participating party subject to the complaint were inconsistent with the wording of the court order.

Contrary to the complainant's opinion, there is no "clearly recognizable illegality" with regard to the court order of June 27, 2022, which the co-participating party should have observed. Given the circumstances of this case, the co-participating party could conceivably assume (cf. Constitutional Court of March 14, 2013, B1326/12) that the information submitted as the subject of the complaint was necessary for the continuation of the enforcement proceedings against the complainant and that the district court's jurisdiction had not been exceeded. Whether the district court or the district court judge can be blamed for a data protection violation by requiring the co-participating party to disclose the complainant's whereabouts is – as already explained above – not the subject of the proceedings.Irrespective of this, it should be noted that, according to the complainant's own statements, he did not comply with the request to provide a serviceable address for the duration of his absence due to his rehabilitation stay, which was issued to him by order of the District Court of June 8, 2022, file number XXXX. Therefore, a request to this effect to the co-participating party does not appear to be unnecessary from the outset. There were good reasons for the co-participating party to believe that the information requested by the District Court was necessary for its judicial activities (cf. Art. 9 (2) (f) GDPR). Contrary to the complainant's opinion, there is no "clearly recognizable illegality" with regard to the court order of June 27, 2022, which the co-participating party should have observed. Rather, given the circumstances of this case, the co-participating party could conceivably assume (cf. Constitutional Court, March 14, 2013, B1326/12) that the information submitted as the subject matter of the complaint was necessary for the continuation of the enforcement proceedings against the complainant and that the district court's jurisdiction had not been exceeded. Whether the district court or the district court judge can be blamed for a data protection violation by requiring the co-participating party to disclose the complainant's whereabouts is – as already explained above – not the subject of these proceedings. Irrespective of this, it should be noted that, according to the complainant's own statements, he did not comply with the request to provide a serviceable address for the duration of his absence due to his rehabilitation stay, which was issued to him by order of the district court of June 8, 2022, file no. 40. Therefore, a request to this effect to the co-participating party does not appear to be unnecessary from the outset. The co-participating party had good reasons to believe that the information requested by the district court was necessary for its judicial activities (see Article 9, paragraph 2, letter f, GDPR).

This shows that the co-participating party used the complainant's personal data in accordance with the (procedural) laws applicable to it and the court's mandate, so that this cannot be objected to from a data protection perspective.

This is also not contradicted by the ECJ judgment of July 4, 2023, C-252/21, cited by the complainant. In the cited judgment, the ECJ essentially addressed the legal basis that operators of online social networks can use to process users' personal data, which means that in any case, no comparable circumstances exist.

As a result, the form of processing (use/transmission/disclosure) of the complainant's personal data by the co-participating party that is the subject of the complaint can be based on the Data Protection Act or the GDPR, as it was covered by a legal basis (and by a court order) and was legitimated in pursuit of a legal purpose or a court order, as well as in the performance of a legal obligation or a task in the substantial public interest of the co-participating party. The data processing under review complied with the requirements and obligations arising from the GDPR and fulfilled the legality requirements set out in the GDPR. Especially since the interference with the fundamental right to data protection in this specific case appears to be proportionate, the restriction of the complainant's right to confidentiality with regard to his (sensitive) data proves to be justified.

Thus, the data processing by the co-participating party that is the subject of the complaint is permissible from a data protection law perspective. A violation of the fundamental right to data protection pursuant to Section 1 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) or provisions of the GDPR (in particular Article 9 (1) GDPR) cannot therefore be seen in the present case. Therefore, the data processing by the participating party, which is the subject of the complaint, is admissible from a data protection law perspective. A violation of the fundamental right to data protection pursuant to Section 1 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) or provisions of the GDPR (in particular Article 9 (1) GDPR) cannot therefore be seen in the present case.

3.3.3. The alleged illegality of the decision therefore does not exist. The proceedings also did not reveal that the decision was unlawful for other, unasserted reasons. Since the contested decision is therefore not unlawful within the meaning of Article 130 (1) (1) of the Federal Constitutional Constitution Act (B-VG), the complaint had to be dismissed. 3.3.3. The alleged illegality of the decision therefore does not exist. The proceedings also did not reveal that the decision was unlawful for other, unasserted reasons. Since the contested decision is therefore not unlawful within the meaning of Article 130, paragraph one, number one, of the Federal Constitutional Law (B-VG), the appeal had to be dismissed.

3.3.4. The Federal Administrative Court does not consider the present appeal to be grounds for submitting an application to the Court of Justice of the European Union pursuant to Article 267 TFEU. Furthermore, in the present case, the Federal Administrative Court is not a court of last instance within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU due to the possibility of filing an ordinary or extraordinary appeal against its decisions with the Supreme Administrative Court (cf. VfSlg. 19.896/2014).

3.4. Pursuant to Section 24(1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the Administrative Court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems it necessary, ex officio.

3.4. Pursuant to Section 24(1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the Administrative Court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems it necessary, ex officio. Pursuant to Section 24(4) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), unless otherwise provided by federal or state law, the administrative court may, notwithstanding a party's request, dispense with a hearing if the records indicate that the oral argument is unlikely to provide further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Article 6(1) of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude the dispensation of the hearing.

This is such a case: In the present case, the facts relevant to the decision are established and clarified based on the records. According to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, an oral hearing is not required to resolve legal issues. The ECHR and the Charter of Fundamental Rights therefore do not preclude waiving an oral hearing. For these reasons, it was also not necessary to hold a public oral hearing ex officio.

Regarding B)

According to Section 25a(1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGG), the administrative court must state in its judgment or decision whether the appeal on points of law is admissible pursuant to Article 133(4) of the Federal Constitutional Constitution Act (B-VG). The judgment must be briefly reasoned. According to Section 25a(1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGG), the administrative court must state in its judgment or decision whether the appeal on points of law is admissible pursuant to Article 133(4) of the Federal Constitutional Constitution Act (B-VG). The judgment must be briefly reasoned.

The present decision does not depend on the resolution of a legal issue of fundamental importance. There is neither a lack of case law of the Administrative Court, nor does the present decision deviate from the case law of the Administrative Court; furthermore, the present case law of the Administrative Court cannot be considered inconsistent. There are also no other indications of the fundamental importance of the legal issues to be resolved. The Federal Administrative Court can rely on established case law of the Administrative Court or on an already clear legal situation for all significant legal issues. It is also not apparent that the appeal raises a legal issue that has significance beyond the (concrete) individual case at hand. Based on this, a legal issue of fundamental importance cannot be affirmed in this respect either. It was therefore necessary to declare that the appeal is inadmissible pursuant to Article 133(4) of the Federal Constitutional Law (B-VG).
