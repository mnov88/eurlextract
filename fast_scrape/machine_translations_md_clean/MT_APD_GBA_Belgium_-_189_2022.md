## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was contacted on 24 August 2022 by the controller, a human resources provider. The controller stated that it possessed the data subjects file and wanted to provide assistance for job hunting. Wanting to find out more, the data subject sent an access request where she requested among the others the source of personal data, the purpose of processing, the storage period and the legal basis.

On 25 August 2022, the controller replied providing guidance on the right of erasure. The data subject responded that she did not request erasure, but merely wanted access at this point in time. The controller provided its privacy policy as a response and stated that the data subject could look for an answer therein. The data subject replied that the answer was not in the privacy policy and that she was still unable to determine the source of personal data, the purpose of processing, the storage period and the legal bases. On 29 August 2022, the controller did provide some information regarding the source of the data: It received the data subject's data from another service (nature and name of the service undisclosed), which worked together with employers to find suitable jobs for potential employees.

The data subject filed a complaint at the Belgian DPA on 14 December 2022, because the controller did not provide a substantive enough answer within one month to the access request ([Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR")) nor any extension under [Article 12(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR") had ever been communicated.

### Holding

The DPA deemed the controllers answer to the access request inadequate, because it had only provided the name of the source of personal data while the data subject requested more information described in [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR"). Therefore, the controller violated [Articles 12(3)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR"), [12(4)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR") and [15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR").

The DPA went into further detail regarding the source of the personal data. The DPA specified that the controller had the obligation to provide certain basic information to the data subject because of the accountability principle ([Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR")). The controller had to show that personal data was processed in a GDPR compliant manner. This would also obligate the controller to show it had assessed if a third party was lawfully processing personal data before the receiving personal data from this third party. For this reason, the data subject could expect the controller to provide information about the way the third party had collected the data subject's personal data in the first place, as well as provide information about the legal basis this third party was using for its processing. The controller should also provide the contact details of this third party to the data subject. This would enable the data subject to exercise the right of access by contacting such third party.

The DPA ordered the controller to comply with the access request pursuant of [Article 58(2)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2c "Article 58 GDPR") and Article 95(1)(5) WOG. This was a preliminary decision prior to the decision on the merits.

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of 27 April 2016 on

on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (general

Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter GDPR;

Having regard to the law of 3 December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority, hereinafter WOG;

                                                                                                  .
The complainant: Mrs X, hereinafter referred to as “the complainant”; .

                                                                                                  .

The controller: Y, hereinafter “the controller” Decision on the substance 189/2022 - 2/7

I. Factual Procedure

    1. On 14 December 2022, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority against

        the controller.

    2. The object of the complaint concerns the exercise of the right of inspection by the complainant without

        that it has received a substantively satisfactory answer from the controller

        active in the human resources sector, within the period of one month (article 12.3 GDPR), nor
        to notify the extension of that period (article 12.4 GDPR). The specific reason for the

        exercise of the right of access was the fact that the complainant became on August 24, 2022

        contacted by the controller who stated that the file of the complainant

        located in its database, offering the complainant to provide assistance in finding

        a new professional challenge. The complainant will also be asked to renew the
        contract. On August 25, 2022, the complainant will receive a response to the effect that the

        controller explains how the complainant can obtain data erasure.

        The complainant, in turn, responds that it wishes to erase data and, for the time being, no data

        the complainant will receive on August 25, 2022 from the controller the

        privacy statement with the question whether she can find the answer to her questions
        on August 29, 2022 that this is not the case and that she still did not receive an answer to her

        ask about the origin, purpose, retention period, and legal basis for the hair

        regarding data processing. The controller informs the complainant about 30

        August 2022 that her personal data was obtained as a result of

        a registration with the \[…\] that forwards the data to employers who work with them

        the framework of job placement, with the aim of finding suitable employment. The
        the complainant subsequently stated on 2 December 2022 that he still had no answer

        received on her question about the legal basis for the data processing and the retention period

        of it, nor about the extent to which it was informed about the data processing and how

        processing fits within the principle of purpose limitation, the principle of minimum

        data processing and correctness, since she has been employed with her for more than two years
        current employer and has never lived or worked in (…), nor has any interest in doing so

        shown.

    3. On December 14, 2022, the complaint will be declared admissible by the First Line Service on the grounds

        of Articles 58 and 60 WOG and the complaint is settled on the basis of art. 62, §1 WOG transferred to

        the Disputes Chamber. Decision on the substance 189/2022 - 3/7

II. Motivation

    4. Based on the documents supporting the complaint, the Litigation Chamber determines that the complainant has its right

         has exercised access, but the controller has failed to do so

         to take appropriate action by limiting itself to only mentioning the name of the body whose

         personal data were obtained, notwithstanding the fact that the complainant also

         requested other information (including legal basis, retention period) included in Article 15.1

         AVG. As a result, the controller has acted in violation of Articles 12.3 and 12.4
              1 2
         GDPR , as well as Article 15.1 GDPR .

                                                                                                      3
    5. Specifically with regard to the origin of the personal data about which the

         controller, the Litigation Chamber states that the accountability
                            4
         (article 5.2 GDPR) of the controller entails basic information

         is provided to the person concerned, being the complainant, showing that the

         controller itself processes the data in accordance with the GDPR and prior to the

         obtaining the personal data checks whether that data is lawfully processed by

         the authority from which the personal data originates. Thus, the complainant can expect that the

(“accountability”). Decision on the substance 189/2022 - 4/7

        came into possession of the complainant's personal data, as well as the legal basis on which it is based

        whose data are processed by that authority in order to demonstrate that the data

        from the complainant have been lawfully obtained by the controller. In order to the

        rights of the complainant, the controller must also provide it with the

        make contact details of that authority available in order to enable the complainant

        to exercise its right of access vis-à-vis that authority, being the \[…\].

    6. With regard to the other information that the complainant has requested and is entitled to

        Pursuant to Article 15.1 GDPR, the controller has left nothing there

        to provide an answer.

    7. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that on the basis of the above analysis it should be

        concluded that the controller has committed a breach of the provisions of the
        GDPR was committed, which justifies taking a

        decision pursuant to Article 95, §1, 5° WOG, more specifically the controller in

        orders to follow up on the exercise by the complainant of his right of access (art

        15.1 GDPR) and this in particular in view of the document submitted by the complainant showing that

        the complainant has indeed exercised its right of access, but the

        controller has not taken appropriate action.

        in accordance with article 95 WOG on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant, in the context of

        the 'procedure prior to the decision on the merits' and no decision on the merits of the

        Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 WOG.

    9. The purpose of this decision is to inform the controller of the

        fact that it may have committed a breach of the provisions of the GDPR and put it in the

        possibility to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.

    10. However, if the controller does not agree with the content of this

        prima facie decision and considers that it may leave factual and/or legal arguments

        funds that could lead to a different decision, this can be done via the e-mail address
