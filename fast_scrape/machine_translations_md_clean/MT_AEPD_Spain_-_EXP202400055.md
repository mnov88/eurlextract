## English Summary

### Facts

Caja Rural de Jaén, Barcelona y Madrid, Sociedad Cooperativa de Crédito (the data controller), is a Spanish financial institution that provides banking services, including online banking through its platform Ruralvía Clásica. The bank outsourced its IT and data security operations to Rural Servicios Informáticos S.L. ("RSI"), a third-party service provider acting as a data processor. On December 12, 2022, RSI notified the AEPD (Spanish DPA) about a data breach affecting multiple entities within the Caja Rural Group, including Caja Rural de Jaén. The breach resulted from a cyberattack that exploited vulnerabilities in the online banking system. Unauthorized third parties gained access to data subjects, including personally identifiable information. The breach itself occurred on November 10, 2022, but was not detected until December 7, 2022.

Following RSI’s initial notification, Caja Rural de Jaén submitted an additional breach notification on January 12, 2023. The AEPD subsequently launched an investigation to determine whether the bank had failed to implement adequate security measures in compliance with GDPR. The investigation revealed that the bank’s security controls were insufficient. Furthermore, the investigation examined whether Caja Rural de Jaén had adequately notified the data breach in accordance with Articles 32 and 33 of the GDPR.

On January 23, 2024, the AEPD initiated a sanctioning procedure against Caja Rural de Jaén, proposing a fine for violations of data protection laws. The agency issued its resolution on December 2, 2024, concluding that the bank had violated Article 5.1(f) (failure to ensure data security) and imposed a €500,000 fine.

### Holding

AEPD held that Caja Rural de Jaén, Barcelona y Madrid, S.C.C. violated Article 5.1(f) of the GDPR by failing to implement adequate security measures to ensure the confidentiality of the data subjects. The bank’s online banking system (Ruralvía Clásica) had known security vulnerabilities that were not properly addressed, allowing unauthorized third-party access to personal data. The AEPD concluded that these deficiencies directly contributed to the data breach and exposed customers to risks such as identity theft and financial fraud.

The AEPD further ruled that the bank breached [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") by failing to implement effective security mechanisms, including intrusion detection systems and real-time monitoring tools, which could have prevented or at least mitigated the attack. The bank relied on its IT provider, Rural Servicios Informáticos, S.L. (RSI), without proper oversight, despite its obligation as the data controller to ensure compliance with data protection regulations according to [Article 28 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR "Article 28 GDPR"). The investigation found that internal security audits had previously flagged risks, but corrective measures were either insufficient or not properly enforced.

Additionally, the AEPD found a violation of [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"), as the bank failed to detect and respond to the breach on time. The attack occurred on November 10, 2022, but was not detected until December 7, 2022, nearly a month later. This delay prolonged the exposure of sensitive customer data, and the official notification to the AEPD did not take place until December 12, 2022. The prolonged unauthorized access period indicated a lack of effective monitoring and threat detection measures.

As a result, the AEPD imposed a €500,000 fine on Caja Rural de Jaén for violations of Articles 5.1(f), 32, and 33 GDPR.

## Comment
