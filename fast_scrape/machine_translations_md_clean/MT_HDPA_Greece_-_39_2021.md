## English Summary

### Facts

A bus driver ("X") working for the Municipal Transport Company of Rhodes ("RODA") was dismissed following a controversial incident. After having been dismissed, X asked RODA to provide him with a certificate of service. According to the applicable Greek law, such certificate should indicate the identity of the individual concerned, the type of occupation, as well as the period of employment. RODA however delivered a certificate which also included, in addition to the legally required information, the fact that X had been fired because of a criminal act. X considered that adding this information on the certificate was disproportionate and could cause him prejudice.

Exercising his right to access under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"), X requested RODA to provide him with a copy of the video-tape from the bus camera in order to verify what had happened on the day of the controversial incident. In accordance with [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR"), RODA had the obligation to answer that request within one month upon receipt. RODA however never replied to X's request.

X considered that by acting this way, RODA had infringed the GDPR. He therefore lodged a complaint with the Greek DPA. During the procedure, RODA explained that it had orally informed X of the fact that the video-tapes of the bus were systematically deleted after 7 days. X, however, denied having received that information.

### Holding

After considering all the facts of the case, the Greek DPA found that RODA had breached [Article 5(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1 "Article 5 GDPR") (principle of data minimisation), as well as [Article 12(3)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") [and 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") (right of access by the data subject - obligation to reply within a month). In particular, the Greek DPA considered that, by adding on the certificate of service an information that was unnecessary and which could cause prejudice to the data subject, RODA had infringed the principle of data minimisation. Furthermore, by not replying to X's request to be provided with a copy of the video-tape, RODA had infringed its obligation with respect to access requests. The Greek DPA therefore decided to impose on RODA a fine of 5,000 EUR for breach of [Article 12(3)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") [and 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"), and a fine of 3,000 EUR for breach of [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR").
