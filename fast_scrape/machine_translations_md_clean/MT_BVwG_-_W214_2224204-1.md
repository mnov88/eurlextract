## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a municipality. The data subject owns property in the controller’s district. The data subject won a lawsuit against the controller, obliging it to connect the data subject’s property to the municipal drinking water supply. The judgement was limited to the supply needed for a single-family home. The controller complied with the judgement and connected the data subject’s property to its water supply system. It also installed an analogous water meter (not a smart meter) at the beginning of the water pipe to measure the consumption of the data subject’s property. The water meter is checked once a year by the municipality. The results are stored in the municipality’s software application which is hosted in an Austrian datacenter. The data is retained for thirty years to exercise or defend against possible legal claims.

Moreover, because multiple times in the past the data subject used vast amounts of water, exceeding the need of a single-family home by far, the municipality installed a system that measured the daily consumption of the data subject. At the beginning, the system worked as follows: An incremental encoder was installed on top of the water meter. This incremental encoder sent digital signals to a programmable logic controller (PLC) at the water supply facility of the controller every time water was used by the data subject. The programmable logic controller counted the signals and if the usage of the data subject exceeded the threshold of 950 liters per day, the PLC closed the solenoid valve of the pipe, cutting of the water supply to the data subject's property. The counter was automatically reset each day to zero. After five months the controller switched to a system where the water supply was not automatically shut off by the PLC but an employee was notified to check whether the alarm was accurate and, if yes, to shut off the water supply manually.

After the data subject learned about this conduct of the controller, she asked the controller for the information according to [Articles 13](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and [14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"), objected to the processing pursuant to [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR") and requested the restriction of the processing under [Article 18 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_18_GDPR "Article 18 GDPR"). The controller provided the data subject with the information according to [Articles 13](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and [14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR") but denied the request for restriction under [Article 18 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_18_GDPR "Article 18 GDPR"). As a consequence, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Austrian DPA (Datenschutzbehörde – DSB) asserting a violation of its rights under [Articles 17](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"), [18](/index.php?title=Article_18_GDPR "Article 18 GDPR"), [21](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR") and [22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR"). The Austrian DPA rejected the complaint as unfounded which lead to the data subject initiating court proceedings.

### Holding

The Austrian Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht – BVwG) rejected the complaint and upheld the DPA’s decision entirely.

The court held that the controller was processing personal data according to [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1 "Article 4 GDPR") because, at least, in (small) private homes measuring the water consumption can give insights into the beaviour of the residents. The court also corrected the view of the DSB which was of the opinion that the controller is not obliged to erase data of its own accord but only if the data subject requested it to do so. It clarified that according to the explicit wording of [Article 17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR") erasing the data of its own accord is an obligation of the controller and a request by the data subject is not necessary. However, it found that [Articles 17(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1c "Article 17 GDPR"),[(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1d "Article 17 GDPR") and [21(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#1 "Article 21 GDPR") were not violated because the processing was lawful under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") since measuring the water consumption was necessary to fairly distribute the costs among all users, to check whether the data subject exceeds the water supply needed for a single-family home, to ensure daily reliability of the distribution system and to detect damages to it. The court further held that the controller did not violate [Article 18 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_18_GDPR "Article 18 GDPR") because the data subject did not show that the data was inaccurate ([Article 18(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_18_GDPR#1a "Article 18 GDPR")) and the data subject did not oppose the erasure of the data but rather tried to achieve it with its complaint ([Article 18(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_18_GDPR#1b "Article 18 GDPR")). Moreover, since the controller did not violate [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"), the court found that the requirements of [Article 18(1)(d)](/index.php?title=Article_18_GDPR#1d "Article 18 GDPR") were also not met, and a violation of [Article 18(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_18_GDPR#1c "Article 18 GDPR") was not indicated by the data subject's submissions. Lastly, the court did not find a violation of [Article 22(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#1 "Article 22 GDPR"). It clarified that [Article 22(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#1 "Article 22 GDPR") does not require a request of the data subject – contrary to the DPA’s opinion – because it constitutes a prohibition, although it is systematically listed in Chapter 3 of the GDPR. However, the court found that there was no decision solely based on automated processing as required by [Article 21(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#1 "Article 21 GDPR") because the decision to cut off the supply if the data subject exceeds the daily limit was taken by the controller as a kind of "fundamental decision" before the respective system was installed and was not taken again each time when the supply was actually cut off by the automatic system or the employee (the automatic system or the employee just being the means to enforce the "fundamental decision" of the controller). Furthermore, the court reasoned that there was no automated decision making because, even if the decision was taken each time again, the controller switched from an automated system to a system where the accuracy of the counter is checked by an employee, who is also responsible for shutting off the water supply manually, and therefore the decision was not solely based on automated processing.

## Comment

The court did not address the 30 years’ storage period. The statute of limitations for the majority of claims in Austria is 30 years. However, this should not mean that storing the information is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of a claim ([Articles 17(3)(e)](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#3e "Article 17 GDPR"), [18(2)](/index.php?title=Article_18_GDPR#2 "Article 18 GDPR"), [21(1)](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#1 "Article 21 GDPR") sentence 2 GDPR). The requirement the data must be "necessary" for these purposes requires a balancing of interest, taking into account the likelihood of litigation, the significance of the claims concerned and the interests of the data subject. The statute of limitations does not automatically give a controller the right to store the data for the whole period of the statute.

The argument of the court that [Article 22(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#1 "Article 22 GDPR") is not violated because the controller took a "fundamental decision" to shut off the water supply before installing the system and not every time the automatic system or the employee actually shut off the water supply is legally incorrect. The court basically argued that the automatic system or the employee were just mere tools to enforce the decision of the controller. Other controllers could use this argument in cases where the tool to enforce the decision is not just a simple counter which measures the daily usage and automatically cuts off the supply, but a more sophisticated algorithm. In such a case a controller might also argue that the decision was taken beforehand and that the programmer just designed the algorithm in the way that the decision is enforced when a certain set of conditions are met. The controller could basically argue as long as there is no (real) artificial intelligence a decision is never solely based on automated processing but is always the pre-formulated human decision of the controller manifested in the source code and the algorithm is just a mere tool to enforce this decision. However, "decision based solely on automated processing" does not mean that a machine/computer needs to make an intelligent decision comparable to a human decision. The purpose of [Article 22(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#1 "Article 22 GDPR") is exactly to limit the risks to privacy resulting from the error-proneness of programming and machines/automation in general. Until today no human ever created a machine which worked (forever) flawless.

Legally, the relevant authority stated that water consumption data that

Furthermore, the authority concerned explained that the exercise of the right to deletion as

however, the complaint should also be dismissed with regard to the right of objection. To

the authority concerned explained that according to the wording of Art. 21 Para. 1 DSGVO a

were not presented to the party involved as responsible, thus
is not a claim to the handling of the exercised objection by the co-involved

party emerged. Even if you consider the statements in the application of June 10, 2019 \[meaning:

06/10/2018\], as "explanation of the special situation" in the sense of the above considerations
would qualify, the complaint was to be unsuccessful on this point, since the

no fee is charged, there is also a particular need to check

to be able to ensure that the total water withdrawal of the "XXXX" does not exceed 3050 l/day and

that the water extraction on the complainant's property within the
specified limits, namely for the needs of a single-family home. The opposite

there are no compelling reasons worthy of protection recognizable, which is why the co-involved party

the processing in question should be omitted. So the complainant only
generally brought to the meeting that "profiling" was carried out with the water consumption data

without going into more detail about this process. The water consumption data would

purposes and not otherwise used, so no disproportionate

6. Against the decision in question, the complainant raised with input from
02.10.2019 complaint to the Federal Administrative Court within the deadline and demanded the

this is not frost-free. Furthermore, the complainant submitted that the assessment of evidence

Administrative Court of April 20, 2021, Ro 2021/07/0001-5.

That the water pipe line, at the beginning of which water meter No. XXXX is located,

only measures the amount of water flowing from the complainant's property
is consumed, as well as the flushing processes that take place on a case-by-case basis, which are carried out by the operator

of the water supply system are initiated, results from the above

Comments of the involved party. This is plausible if only because a
Distribution of the electricity costs among the (other) connected customers is not possible

would be, their consumption would not be measured by other water meters. For that yet

other properties (except those to which the flushing line leads) on the water line and

there are no clues., - 19 -

That the maximum daily water consumption is exceeded

Appellant not disputed. That this overrun is not due

Flushing operations of the operator of the water supply system was caused, results for
one from the fact that the complainant herself on the occasion of the incident on XXXX 2017

admitted to having left the water running despite being absent. Also

flushing processes are always documented by the operator of the system in the operating log.
Furthermore, the list provided by the party involved shows the

First of all, it should be noted that the complainant raised a number of legal issues

has, which is not to be dealt with in the context of this procedure. in the representational

not subject to the complaints procedure. Any civil claims can

if necessary, be asserted in civil courts.

The subject of the proceedings is the question of whether by those mentioned in the findings
data processing is a violation of the complainant's rights as a data subject,

namely the right to erasure, the right to object, the right to restriction

the processing and the right, not subject to any automated individual decision
to be, by the involved party.

To qualify water consumption data as personal data in accordance with Art. 4 Z 1
GDPR:

The authority concerned stated in the contested decision that the definition of

"Personal data" according to Art. 2 lit. a of Directive 95/46/EC, mutatis mutandis in Art. 4 Z

1 GDPR has been adopted. information "about" a specific person
inter alia, if data relate to the situation of a person (cf. the

Opinion of the Art. 29 Data Protection Group 4/2007 on the term "personal, - 26 -

Data”, WP 136, 01248/07/DE, p. 10). On the water pipe line, which the
measures the complainant's water consumption and consumption for rinsing purposes,

there are no further connections or consumers. As the party involved in

stated in her statement of November 12, 2021, it is possible with the
water meters to determine the consumption of the complainant's property. the

The authority concerned further explained that water consumption data, which, like

in the present case, to a specific property and thus to a specific one
living situation, to handle personal data in accordance with Art. 4 Z 1 GDPR. It

namely insofar as (also) information would be available "about" the complainant, as

based on the water consumption data, for example, the size of your household or any
and absences can be closed.

The explanations of the authority concerned are to be followed that in (smaller) private

Households a recording of the water consumption conclusions about specific people and
enables their individual habits (cf. also decisions of

Data protection commission from 14.11.2008 to Zl. K121.388/0008-DSK/2008, as well as from

22.10.2008 to Zl. K121.386/0009-DSK/2008, as well as legal aspects of digitization in
of urban water management, Karl Weber, May 9, 2019, p. 369). It is at

Water consumption data is therefore personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 Z. 1 DSGVO.

Violation of certain data subject rights:

The complainant alleged a violation of the right to erasure, the right to

Objection, restriction of processing and in law, none
to be subjected to automated data processing.

For the sake of completeness, it is noted that the right to secrecy according to § 1 DSG

is not the subject of the proceedings, although this is - apparently - by the authority concerned
erroneously - is noted in the course of the contested decision. At long last

However, the authority concerned only spoke about a possible violation of the above

rights off.

It is therefore to be examined below (only) whether a violation of the

The rights of the data subject mentioned by the complainant are given:

Regarding the right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR):

The authority concerned explained in its legal assessment that the exercise of the

processed data are to be deleted (cf. Jahnel/Pallwein-Prettner/Marzi, data protection law
113). This results from the wording of Art. 17 Para. 1 GDPR: "\[...\] the

The person responsible is obliged to delete personal data immediately if

one of the following reasons applies” (cf. Data Protection Law (Spring) 2nd edition, September
2020). The statements of the authority concerned that the complainant had none

The request is not a claim to the handling of the request for deletion by the party involved
arisen, therefore cannot be followed. Rather, it must (also) be checked whether the

involved party itself the personal data of the complainant

would have to delete.

In total, Art. 17 Para. 1 GDPR provides six reasons, after which a

Deletion is to be made, among other things, if there is no longer a need for

Achievement of purpose or unlawful processing. In order to be able to assess whether
one of these facts is fulfilled and the involved party the personal

would have to delete the complainant's data, it must first be clarified from which

Reason the involved party the personal data of the complainant
collected, stored and processed. The authority concerned led in the contested

Notice that the party involved is responsible for the processing of the

data based on legitimate interests according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The involved
The party has given compelling reasons for the processing that are worthy of protection, namely the

measure annual water consumption and identify damage and

to detect broken pipes. In particular, there is also a need
to be able to check that the total water withdrawal of the "XXXX" 3050 l/day is not

exceeds and that the water withdrawal on the complainant's property

within the specified limits, namely for the needs of a single-family home.
The water consumption data would only be used for the aforementioned purposes and not

used elsewhere, so that no disproportionate processing or

Violation of Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR is recognizable. The party involved is also
concede that in view of the limited presence of sufficient

amount of drinking water has a certain bandwidth when dividing the maximum amount of water

will be monitored for the different buyers in order to avoid that an individual, - 28 -

user the total stipulated amount of water (or a disproportionately large proportion)

These explanations of the authority concerned are to be followed: This is how the connection of the

Property of the complainant based on the judgment of the XXXX of XXXX on line XXXX

create. In order to be able to ensure that the withdrawal of water within the framework of the with judgement

granted extent takes place, it is inevitable that a certain control or

the processing, namely to be able to measure the annual water consumption in order to

As far as the complainant in the proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court

submitted that their data will be used for their "surveillance" and to the (new)

Data processing refers to stopping the water supply after reaching
the daily maximum consumption quantity, it should first be noted that this

Even if this processing were included in the legal considerations, it would remain so
The result is the same: With this processing, the collection and

Data processing also only for the purpose of compliance with the judgment of XXXX

and to ensure that the involved party fulfills its obligation to comply with the

can. The design of the data processing also corresponds to the principle of
Data minimization, as only the data necessary to achieve the purpose is processed

will. Thus, in the given case, there are legitimate interests of the party involved

of the processing, which do not have overriding interests of the complainant
oppose Incidentally, it should be noted that the involved party also offered

has to find a solution for a foreseeable exceedance in individual cases, so here
overall, no disproportionate procedure can be assumed.

Therefore, there are none of the requirements specified in Article 17 (1) GDPR for a

deletion before. In particular, it is also due to the overriding interests of those involved
17 (1) (c) GDPR does not apply to the party.

Regarding the right to object (Art. 21 GDPR):

First of all, it should be noted that according to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR the data subject has the right
has, for reasons that arise from their particular situation, at any time against the

to object to the processing of personal data concerning you

based on Article 6 paragraph 1 letters e or f. In this respect, the insertion would be
an objection is possible in principle.

With regard to the right to object, the authority concerned stated that a data subject had

the wording of Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR the reasons arising from your particular situation
arise in the context of exercising the right of objection. This emerges from

a comparison with Art. 21 Para. 2 DSGVO, according to which an objection to the processing
of personal data is possible without such justification. These reasons are - 31 -

has not been explained to the party involved, which is why no claim to
treatment of the objection arose. The statements of the authority concerned

to follow: The complainant does not have a special situation in the entire procedure

be able to explain the reasons that would result in the processing of your
personal data would have to be avoided.

When weighing the interests, reference is made to the above statements on the right

refer to deletion. For the reasons set out above, it can be assumed that the
legitimate reasons of the party involved compared to those of the complainant

prevail, which is why no justified objection was filed and an infringement

the complainant does not have the right to object.

As to the complainant's allegation that this would be profiling,

The following should be noted: In the application of June 10, 2018, the complainant stated "\[...\]

it has been made known that you have used my water consumption data without my consent
continuously check, save and thus carry out profiling, I declare that I

file an objection".

Also in her statement (submitted in the court proceedings) of April 7th, 2020
brought the complainant a (further) prohibited profiling by the co-involved

party before.

First of all, it should be noted here that this new processing is not the subject of the

Procedure before the relevant authority was and could be.

Even if one were to concede to the complainant that she - by
Surveillance of her person or her household asserted - reasons that arise from

resulting from their particular situation, against profiling (in some cases even before the

authorities concerned, but only with regard to the measurement data of the water meters).
it appears that the said processing does not fall within the definition of profiling

correspond:

Art. 4 Z 1 GDPR reads:

"For the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:

4. "Profiling" any type of automated processing of personal data contained therein

exists that this personal data will be used to establish certain personal

As far as the objection relates to the (general) processing of the water meter
ascertained data relates, the following should be noted: In the case of the subject

Water meters are analog rotary piston meters. Only the

Water consumption of the connected property (in the case of the complainant also
nor the mud line) and no additional data that would require an analysis of the

Complainant or a creation of a "profile" would allow. Consequently can

under no circumstances should it be assumed that profiling is being carried out. Is it about
Profiling, as set out in more detail above, namely the collection of certain

personal data to evaluate personal aspects of a natural. Alone

through the measured water consumption is an analysis regarding personal aspects
a natural person within the meaning of this provision is not possible.

Also what the automated determination of a possible exceeding of the

daily water consumption (which was not part of the proceedings before the
authority concerned), it is not a matter of processing that was carried out

is "to control certain personal aspects relating to a natural person
evaluate", but this procedure serves exclusively to comply with the specifications

of the water law decision, which the party involved has to comply with, so that

Even in this case, the facts of a profiling are not fulfilled.

Thus, the complainant's right to object was not violated either., - 33 -

Regarding the right to restriction (Article 18 GDPR):

As explained in the literature, the right to restriction must be applied for

i.e. asserted by the data subject against the person responsible

(Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Art. 18 GDPR, as of December 1, 2020,
rdb.at). Although one could take the view that a restriction of

Responsible in the presence of one of the above conditions on their own

would have to be made, this consideration can be made in the present case
remain undecided, since the complainant has already submitted a request for restriction

of the processing to the party involved.

In accordance with Article 18 (1) (a) GDPR, a data subject has the right to request a restriction
to request processing if the accuracy of the personal data

data subject is disputed, for a period of time that allows the person responsible

allows to check the accuracy of the personal data.

The authority concerned stated in the contested decision that with regard to lit. a leg.

cit. it should be noted that the accuracy of the water consumption data in question has never been

had been disputed. However, in the course of the proceedings (in her
data protection complaint and in its statement of January 28, 2019 and October 2, 2019),

that the water pipeline in question supplies several connections and the
Water data could therefore say nothing about their consumption, and that the

measured data at the only meter in the well shaft of the involved party

are objectifiable or cannot be assigned in a consumption-neutral manner. Dem is
however, to counter that the involved party has not claimed that it is

the processed water meter data, which is read annually, is data

which are attributed to the complainant's property alone, since - like the
involved party is known - also the flushing line to this water meter

connected.

There is no right to restriction of processing according to Art. 18 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR,
if the person responsible comes to the conclusion that the personal data

contrary to the claim of the person concerned are correct (cf. EU-DSGVO:

Short commentary, Feiler Forgó on Article 18 EU-GDPR, 1st edition September 2016, margin no. 3). So
the party involved had no reason for the accuracy of the water meter

to doubt the measured data, the complainant could not explain it either
that the measured consumption data are incorrect. As stated by the - 34 -

party has been credibly informed, only the consumption of the water meter is used
Property of the complainant and that of the flushing line measured. The consumption

of the complainant's property can be determined, however, since the water consumption at

rinsing processes is entered in the logbook or in the meantime by its own
meter is recorded, and this consumption is to be deducted from the common meter reading. Of the

each current consumption of the property is only measured when there is a

Exceeding the amount of water comes, in which case the flushing line
is switched to inactive.

A right to restriction also exists according to Art. 18 Para. 2 GDPR

not if the data processing is to protect the rights of another natural
or legal person is necessary. The question of whether the rights of the person responsible

are protected, the literature on the similar formulations in Art. 15 para. 4 (s

Art. 15 margin no. 49), Art. 20 para. 4 (see Art. 20 margin no. 28), Art. 21 para. 1 (see Art. 21 margin no. 42) and Art. 23 para. 1
lit i (s Art 23 Rz 21) affirmed (Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm Art. 18 GDPR, as of October 1, 2018,

rdb.at). The involved party has explained the reasons for the processing of the data, im

The result was no violation of the right to restriction.

With regard to Art. 18 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR, the statements of the relevant authority in

to follow the contested decision that the complainant's deletion is obvious
has not refused, so that the requirements of this provision are not met

are.

As for the facts of Art. 18 para
lit. d GDPR, there was no doubt from the outset that the legitimate reasons

of the controller outweigh those of the data subject (see

also the considerations on the right to erasure) and this requirement was not either
given, which is why there was no violation of the complainant's right to restriction

existed and exists.

The fact that the facts of Article 18 (c) GDPR were fulfilled was confirmed by the
complainant does not claim and there are no indications for this.

Thus, the prerequisites for a restriction of data processing were and are

not given., - 35 -

The right not to be subject to an automated decision in individual cases (Art. 22
GDPR):

Art. 22 para. 1 GDPR formulates a right of the data subject, but without one

to mention the application. For those responsible, this indirectly means a ban
for automated decisions in individual cases (Schulz in Gola, DS-GVO2 Art. 22 Rz 5; Helfrich

in Sydow, European General Data Protection Regulation2 Art. 22 Rz40 (due to the

"systematic position"); Martini in Paal/Pauly, GDPR/BDSG2 Art. 22 Rz 1, 29).

It therefore seems inaccurate that - as the relevant authority explains - the exercise

of this right and the associated right in Art. 22 Para. 3 GDPR to the presentation of the

own point of view and to contest the decision as a subjective right of the person concerned
according to Art. 12 Para. 3 GDPR - a corresponding application to the person responsible

requires. Rather, the person responsible has - similar to the right to deletion - from

own provision to ensure that this provision is taken into account.

The authority concerned sees the processing of water consumption data for measurement

of the annual water consumption, as well as to identify damage/pipe bursts

and unusually high water consumption by individual consumers
to be able to counteract this, rightly no automated processing. She supports her

Considerations on the fact (relevant at the time of the decision) that the
the present water meter only measures the water consumption, but beyond that

no automated processing takes place. For this reason alone, the facts of Art 22

GDPR not fulfilled.

Incidentally, the not yet relevant in the proceedings before the relevant authority and

facts that only occurred afterwards and are therefore not the subject of the proceedings

regarding the period from the installation of the pulse generator and the solenoid valve on
October 22nd, 2019:

In Art. 22 Para. 1 GDPR, a fundamental prohibition is based solely on one

automated processing based decision. Recital 71 of
GDPR states that the data subject should have the right, no one

subject to a decision to assess personal aspects affecting them

are based solely on automated processing and the legal
have an effect on the person concerned or they are similarly significant

impaired. Art. 22 GDPR is therefore only aimed at those decisions that are made without
any human intervention and shall, based on this provision, - 36 -

Dangers posed by unchecked automated processing operations for the
protection of personality expire, be limited (see Martini in Paal/Pauly, DS-

GVO/BDSG², Art 22 DS-GVO margin nos. 2 and 20).

The complainant was informed by the involved party in a letter dated September 13, 2019
informed about what happens in the future when the maximum daily water consumption is reached

action will be taken. In this respect, the decision was already made by the party involved

taken at this time and is not every time the water consumption amount
is exceeded, by a new "automated decision in individual cases"

to go out This is also because, in the event of an incident, none from the party involved

Decisions are made, but the construction workers according to the
original decision of the involved party and corresponding instructions

Action. For this reason alone, data processing can be used to determine whether

The complainant's property was taken from the daily maximum amount of water,
not to speak of "automated decisions in individual cases". Furthermore

This procedure can also be waived if the complainant

Explains in advance that increased water consumption is necessary in individual cases. the
Procedure does not constitute a decision that the complainant made in a similar manner,

how a decision that produces legal effects is significantly affected.

It should also be noted in this context that the processing in question

(automatic collection of the data, whereupon when a certain

water quantity, an alarm is automatically set off and then the water supply
is interrupted) the controller has been programmed since March 2020 in such a way that no

the solenoid valve closes automatically when the limit value is exceeded. the

Information about reaching the maximum amount of water becomes automatic in the first step
transmitted to the building yard employee on duty, who then takes the

switch off manually. By involving a building yard employee after triggering

the alarm, which can switch off and check the water supply,
whether the triggering of the alarm is due to the high water consumption or

was incorrect, it is in any case not a question of a decision made without any

human intervention takes place. Therefore, without the intervention of a natural person,
In the present case, the water supply cannot be shut off.

The fact that the processing in question is not profiling has been confirmed
already set out above (in the considerations on the right to object). It is therefore also

no violation of Art. 22 GDPR., - 37 -

recognize (cf. ECtHR 20.6.2013, Appl. No. 24510/06, Abdulgadirov/AZE, margin no. 34 ff). Also after

the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court may hold an oral hearing
omitted if the facts are undisputed and the legal issue is not addressed by anyone

particular complexity (VfSlg. 17.597/2005; VfSlg. 17.855/2006; most recently VfGH

June 18, 2012, B 155/12).

It was therefore not necessary to conduct an oral hearing.

3.5. Re B) Inadmissibility of the revision:

According to § 25a Abs. 1 VwGG, the administrative court in the ruling of its knowledge or

Pronounce a resolution as to whether the revision is permissible in accordance with Art. 133 Para. 4 B-VG. Of the

Statement must be briefly justified.

The present decision does not depend on the resolution of a legal question

is of fundamental importance. Neither is there a lack of case law

Administrative Court, the decision in question deviates from the
Jurisdiction of the Administrative Court; further is the present

Jurisdiction of the Administrative Court should also not be judged as inconsistent. It

there are also no other indications of a fundamental importance of the to be solved
legal questions. The Federal Administrative Court can appeal to all significant

Legal questions based on existing case law or an already clear legal situation.

Based on this, a legal question within the meaning of Art. 133 Para. 4 B-VG of
of fundamental importance cannot be affirmed in this respect either (cf. e.g. VwGH 25.09.2015, - 38 -

Ra 2015/16/0085, with further references). It was therefore to be stated that the revision pursuant to Art. 133

Para. 4 B-VG is not permitted in each case.

3.5. It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
