## English Machine Translation of the Decision

The decision below is a machine translation of the Latvian original. Please refer to the Latvian original for more details.

```
The Data State Inspectorate has imposed a fine of EUR 15,000 on the online store (SIA “HH Invest”).

An important precondition for the implementation of the data subject's control over the processing of personal data by the company is the right to receive information related to the data processing. Without receiving the information, the data subject is unable to make informed, informed decisions about the company's actions with the data.

As part of its own initiative, the Data State Inspectorate examined the content of the website's privacy policy, concluding that the information available to data subjects was not in easy-to-understand language, provided in a non-systematic way. It was concluded that certain aspects of the processing that had to be explained to the data subject in accordance with Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation were not clarified.

The administrative fine was imposed taking into account the fact that the online store actively cooperated with the supervisory authority during the inspection and has eliminated the discrepancies identified by the Data State Inspectorate.

As a result of the performed inspection, it is ensured that one of the largest online stores in Latvia has improved the information provided to data subjects regarding the processing of personal data.

The online store appealed the decision in court, which means that the penalty imposed is not considered extreme.
