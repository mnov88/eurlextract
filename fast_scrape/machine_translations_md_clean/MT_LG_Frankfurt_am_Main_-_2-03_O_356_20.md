## English Summary

### Facts

It follows from the court decision that the applicant rents a property from the defendant company. Most probably (this does not result directly from the decision) there was a dispute between the parties concerning the tenancy contract (probably the tenancy rent) and the defendant wanted to distribute the applicant's personal data related to the tenancy contract by publicly displaying the contract. Due to the urgency of the case and the threat to the claimant's personal data, the claimant filed a demand with the court to issue an injunction prohibiting the defendant from making the contract public.

### Dispute

Can a person affected by illegal data processing (outside the journalistic/editorial area) assert claims for data protection by way of a civil law injunction claim?

### Holding

The court found that a person affected by illegal data processing (outside the journalistic/editorial area) may pursue claims for data protection by means of a court injunction. Such claims are not blocked by [Article 79 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_79_GDPR "Article 79 GDPR").

Furthermore, the court considered that the lack of correspondence among the parties in the time between the letter of warning and the application in the preliminary injunction procedure does not lead to the rejection of the application, but only to the obligation of the court to examine it.

## Comment

The court found that the defendant may not rely on one of the grounds indicated in [Article 6(1)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") to publicly display the contract. The publication of the tenancy contract may not be justified by the necessity of processing for the performance of the tenancy contract ([Article 6(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR")). That the defendant has relied on a legitimate interest under [Article 6(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), was neither been submitted by the defendant nor was it otherwise apparent.

The defendant also claimed that there was a discrepancy between the warning he received and the application for an injunction. The court stated that this was not a reason to reject the application, but only to have it examined by the court.

In this respect, the Chamber assumes that the person concerned can also assert claims under data protection law by way of injunction and that such claims are not blocked by Art. 79 GDPR (see also LG Frankfurt a.M.,
