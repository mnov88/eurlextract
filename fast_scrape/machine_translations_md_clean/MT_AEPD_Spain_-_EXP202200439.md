## English Summary

### Facts

In the first place, the data subject submitted a claim against their former employer company (the controller) for an illegal communication of their previous trade union membership data. Specifically, the controller sent to the CGT Union a registered mail explaining that the data subject had been a worker representative in another Union (Sindicato Unitario de Huelva) and that could lead to an incompatibility with their current nomination in CGT Union.

Additionally, the data subject claimed that their union membership and other data were also shared to the media since there were some news about their dismissal. In this regard, the data subject presented a letter sent by the controller stating that “\[Data subject’s\] disciplinary dismissal was prior to their nomination by CGT Union as company’s union section secretary, since the data subject was a member of Sindicato Unitario de Huelva when dismissed”.

Furthermore, it was published in another medium that the data subject was dismissed on disciplinary grounds.

Considering the above, the Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding and notified the controller, who claimed that the communication of the union membership data was carried out in a common context of legal cooperation between the controller and the workers who make use of their right to freedom of union. The mention of the data subject in this interaction was allegedly due to their relation with both unions and the company, and that information shared had direct effect to the right to freedom of union.

### Holding

First, the DPA agreed that data relating to trade union membership constitutes sensitive data within the meaning of [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"). The DPA alluded to [Article 9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") which prohibits the processing of these special categories of personal data. On the other hand, [Article 9(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") contains a list of exceptions for this prohibition. One of them allows for the processing of sensitive data in order to assess the working capacity of the employees. Additionally, [Article 9(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") states that the processing shall be allowed when performed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy.

The DPA also noted that [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") contains the legal bases for lawful processing. Therefore, these two Articles establish the circumstances for the legal processing of the general and special categories of data, respectively.

Finally, the DPA referred to Article 29 Working Party on its [“Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-making and Profiling for the Purpose of Regulation 2016/679”](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612053) stating that data controllers can only process sensitive data if one of the conditions of Article 9(2) is fulfilled, in addition to any one of the conditions of Article 6 GDPR.

In this case, the controller claimed to have a legitimate interest for the processing of the data, therefore it did not ask for the data subject's consent. However, legitimate interest, even if the controller had one, cannot be a legal basis for the processing of sensitive data.

Taking this into account, the DPA conclued that the controller had no valid legal basis for the processing of trade union membership data. It fined the controller twice €40,000 for infringing [Articles 6](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and [9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), respectively. This was reduced to a total of €64,000 due to voluntary payment.

                                  BACKGROUND

FIRST: On July 26, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against SERVICES
ESPECIALES, S.A (hereinafter, the claimed party), by means of the Agreement

            AGREEMENT TO START A SANCTION PROCEDURE

Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and in

based on the following

                                      FACTS

FIRST: On November 27, 2021, A.A.A. (hereinafter the part
claimant) filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

The claim is directed against SERVICIOS ESPECIALES, S.A with NIF A11001450
(hereinafter, the claimed party).

The grounds on which the claim is based are as follows:

The claimant states that the entity claimed has improperly communicated to the
CGT union, details of your previous union affiliation.

The entity informed the CGT union, through the burofax sent on August 17,

2021, that the appointment of the claimant as a representative of the workers
communicated to them by the Unitarian Union of Huelva at the end of 2020 may be
incompatible with the appointment now communicated by the CGT.

The claimant states that the respondent entity also revealed its union affiliation to
several media outlets that have published news related to his

dismissal.

Provide a letter dated December 30, 2021 sent by the entity claimed
requesting a media outlet, Huelva24.com, to rectify the content of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/12

the news published on 12/27/21, revealing in the letter "that the disciplinary dismissal is
before the CGT Huelva union appointed her secretary of the union section
of the company, because in fact A.A.A. belonged to the Unitarian Union when she was fired

of Huelva.

It also provides the publication of news in other communication media with
details of your dismissal, your name and details of your union affiliation.

In La Voz del Sur.es the statements of the director of the funeral home are published in the

that the claimant worked, informing about her union affiliation.

In the publication "the digital funeral home" it is reported that: "The company SERVISA, the
Seguros Ocaso funeral home, has issued a statement denying that the
dismissal occurred because the worker refused to wear a skirt and wear

9 cm heels and it was for disciplinary reasons".

This statement contains the same words published by Huelva24.com:
 "Servisa assures that the disciplinary dismissal is prior to the CGT union
Huelva appointed her as secretary of the union section of the company, since she belonged
upon being fired from the Unitarian Union of Huelva".

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, of Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), on January 25, 2022, said claim was transferred to
the party claimed, so that it proceeded to its analysis and inform this Agency in the

period of one month, of the actions carried out to adapt to the requirements
provided for in the data protection regulations.

On February 25, 2022, this Agency received a written response
indicating that a treatment of the data of union affiliation of the

claimant by two unions, within the scope of the legal dialogue
established for the purposes of cooperation between the entity claimed and workers in
the exercise of the right to freedom of association.

In the course of this dialogue, the claimant is the subject of attention, as the
of consideration by the two unions and by the claimed entity.

It is in this circumstance that, before his legitimate interlocutor, in this case the
second union, the claimed entity exposes some very specific circumstances
directly related to the person notified by the union and affecting the
right to freedom of association, with the sole intention of clarifying the situation of the

claimant and his new position in this second union.

The use of the data object of attention was produced in a reactive way within a
process of successive communications between the union and the claimed entity. That
this is its appropriate and even necessary environment. Without forgetting that article 7 EC

includes the democratic principle, to which unions are also subject in the
fulfillment of its functions, and that article 28 EC establishes that the freedom
Union includes the right to join the union of your choice.

                                           IV

In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered that the respondent party has communicated the trade union data
of the claimant to third parties without being in any of the assumptions that by way of
of exception allow their treatment according to article 9 of the RGPS.

The known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to the party
claimed, for violation of article 9, indicated in the foundation of law II.

Likewise, in accordance with the available evidence, and without prejudice to
what results from the instruction of this sanctioning procedure, is considered

that we are facing an illicit treatment of personal data, since in this case the
respondent party treats the union data of the claimant, considering that it had
legitimate interest for its treatment, despite not having your consent.

Its non-compliance supposes the infringement of article 6 of the RGPD indicated in the
basis of law III, since the personal data have been processed without counting

with no kind of legitimacy.

                                           v

Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: "Each control authority will have

of all the following corrective powers indicated below:

b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with a warning
when the treatment operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation;

d) order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period;

i) impose an administrative fine under article 83, in addition to or instead of

the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each
particular case;
                                           SAW

Both the infringement of article 9 and article 6 of the RGPD, are found

provided for in article 83.5 a) of the RGPD where it is established that:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or, in the case of
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of

Total annual global business of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest
amount:
a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12

In turn, article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD in its letters e) and b) qualifies as an infringement
very serious for prescription purposes:

e) “The processing of personal data of the categories referred to in article
9 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 without any of the circumstances
provided for in said precept and in the article of this Organic Law.”

b) “The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions of

legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

Both offenses can be sanctioned with a maximum fine of €20,000,000.
or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the

of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5 of the RGPD.

                                            7th

In order to determine the administrative fines to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that indicate:

“Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
under this Article for infringements of this Regulation
indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case effective,
proportionate and dissuasive.”

“Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the nature

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
“Sanctions and corrective measures”, provides:

"two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:

a) The continuing nature of the offence.

b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatment of
personal information.

c) The profits obtained as a result of committing the offence.

d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have induced the commission

instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction of fine to
impose SERVICIOS ESPECIALES, S.A, as responsible for the infractions

typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, in an initial assessment, they are estimated
Concurrent in this case, as aggravating factors, the following factors:

      Linking the activity of the offender with the performance of

it is appropriate to graduate the sanctions to be imposed in the amount of €40,000 (forty thousand euros)
for the infringement of article 9 of the RGPD and €40,000 (forty thousand euros) for the infringement

of article 6 of the RGPD.
