## English Summary

### Facts

Employees of the controller, a real estate agency, came to the data subject's home to offer their services in relation to a property owned by her father. Intrigued, she asked the employees where they had obtained her and her father's personal data. In response, employees informed that the agency used a website to find out where they lived.

The data subject then filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA, claiming that obtaining her data from a third party and using it for promotional purposes was illegal.

In the procedure, the controller admitted that its employees obtained her name from the neighbors and used the services of a website called Quality Provider to find out where she lived and offer her their services.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA began its analysis by emphasizing that all processing of personal data needs a legal basis. It recalled that access to personal data, in itself, constitutes a processing operation and must be supported by a legal basis.

In the present case, the DPA noted that the controller did not indicate any of the hypotheses of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") as a legitimizing basis for its action. In addition, it pointed out that, when the controller intends to rely on its legitimate interests, it must carry out a balancing exercise prior to the processing of personal data.

Considering that the controller failed to comply with this obligation, the DPA found a violation of article 6(1) GDPR and imposed a fine of €5,000.

                RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following

                                   BACKGROUND

FIRST: A.A.A. British citizen residing in Spain (hereinafter, the
claimant) dated 06/21/2021, filed a claim in English, before the Agency
Spanish Data Protection. The claim is directed against GSMA LTD. with

NIF N4004237F (hereinafter, the one claimed). The reasons on which the claim is based
are the following:

She was invited as a speaker in the edition of the MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS, (MWC)
June 2021, held in Barcelona. To this end, the option was given to register
for the event in "virtual", or "in person". For the "in-person" option, "the

claimed requests to upload special category data-passport details,
including photographs that are transferred to a processor located in a third country-,
for facial recognition for security purposes”.

It states that the privacy policy (https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/legal/privacy-
policy), "establishes that the basis of treatment is consent, however, in

email has been declared to be based on article 6.1 c) of the GDPR, it is
that is, compliance with a legal obligation, referring to article 22.2 of
the LOPD and article 11.1.h of Organic Law 2/1986. not possible to register
as a face-to-face speaker without uploading (uploading) biometric data. despite trying
troubleshoot the issue to find an alternative, it has been necessary to upload my
passport for registration.”

It considers that there is no valid legal obligation for this type of treatment of
face recognition.

On the other hand, neither the privacy policies nor the communications maintained with the
claimed through email, provide clear information on the
data transfers to a data processor in a third country.

While the policies do not refer to any sub-processor,
nor are transfers to third parties recognized, if it is done in documents referenced to
through the privacy policy in a FAQ section,
https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/attend/event-entry/breez/breez-faq, which indicates

that:

"If you decide to participate in BREEZ (acronym for Biometric Recognition Easy Entry
Zone, easy access zone with biometric recognition), your biometric data will be
communicated to the following third-party provider that carries out the recovery activities:

producing a transfer.

In communications with the GSMA, they have stated in an email: "Regarding
tion with your fourth point, the servers that process ID-related data are
located in Europe. There is no transfer of personal data to Russia. Our supplier-
chosen service provider has a global presence, despite being based in Bien-
lorussia. Please be assured that the GSMA only contracts with companies to
act on their behalf if such companies are able to provide representation

nes and guarantees against unauthorized transfer to third parties.”

“Although we have asked the GSMA for any standard contractual clauses or rules
relevant binding corporate laws, none have been provided.

“With reference to the recommendations of the European Committee for Data Protection
(CEPD) on measures that complement the transfer tools for
ensure compliance with the EU level of Personal Data Protection,
adopted on November 10, 2020, I believe that the GSMA has not considered the risk
potential transfer to a third country through remote access. Therefore, the
supposed confidence in the adequacy as an instrument of legal transfer is not

effective."

 Claimed, 05/28/2021, at 10:46 a.m. Indicates that information is available

about the process required for identification, the recipients and the period of

as in the registration process. “In summary, the GSMA organizes the MWC together
with the Spanish authorities. Passport and identification details are required
by the Spanish police, Mossos d' Esquadra. Please note that this is not a
new requirement. However, the manner in which this information is provided,

electronically, has changed for 2021, because businesses need to have
a non-contact environment.” That being said, keep in mind that identification, data
of identification and the fact of providing the passport, it is not obligatory for the
virtual pass holders, who may attend without providing such information.”

 Complainant, 05/28/2021, 11:26 a.m. It indicates that the website suggests that the person
can select, not opt-out, by automatic registration, "and it is something that
like to do". It also alludes to the fact that the website mentions health reasons for uploading
the documentation, but this would not justify uploading the passport and the photo for not keeping
relationship, and that on the web it can be deduced that the data is transferred to an entity

Belarus, with the dangers that this entails.

-“ an automatic verification that uses facial recognition technology to match

facial recognition technology.

"You must select the second option if you do not want automatic verification."

"In relation to your fourth point, the servers that process the identification data
are established in Europe. There is no transfer of personal data to
Russia. Our selected service providers have a global presence

On 09/10/2021, this Agency received a written response that bears the
indication GSMA Ltd., at an address in Atlanta, USA. It begins by stating:
I am writing on behalf of GSMA Ltd. (GSMA) in connection with the letter sent
E/8199/21…”.

According to information from the internet, GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications,
“Global System for Mobile Communications”) is an industry organization
of the mobile that brings together operators from all over the world, more than 750 operators of
mobile telephony and more than 400 Companies are associated as members. In the web
www.mwcbarcelona.com/legal which contains information on the Congress of

Barcelona 2022, it is indicated that "GSMA LTD with its main place of business
located in Atlanta, USA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the GSM Association, and
with respect to 4yfn 2022, GSMA 4fyn EVENT MANAGEMENT S.L., a subsidiary
of GSMA LTD., welcomes you to MWC BARCELONA 2022.", and that "GSMA LTD
and its affiliates provide you with the event…”

In response, state:

1) The claimant and the respondent continued in contact after the last copy
of mail of 06/04/2021 and a satisfactory resolution was achieved "registered for the

Congress as a virtual assistant and took part as a speaker in a round table”, and
the respondent provided you with a “free virtual pass” and you were not required to download or upload
an identity document that was the element on which his claim was based. No
It is therefore true that the defendant "uploaded the passport."

2) Provides, for clarification purposes, the statements contained in the
claim and the correction estimated by the defendant, possibly due to
“possible misunderstandings.”

a) Regarding whether the event is face-to-face or virtual, the GSMA requires uploading or uploading data

such as the passport, which are transferred to a person in charge in a third country, manifests
that:

-An identification control was necessary for all face-to-face attendance at the
conference. Identity validation by FR (facial recognition) was optional.

Identity verification was not required for most virtual passes.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/48

“There was an option for identity validation to take place without the use of
of RF”. “The FR solution was only one of the three options for the validation of
identity made available. Options include:

 validation of identification with FR,

 the manual validation of identification sent online, (standard ID validation-
common identity validation).

 and in limited circumstances, identification validation on paper, face-to-face,
in situ.

He therefore considers that it is not entirely true that: "it is not possible to register as a
face-to-face speaker without uploading biometric data”. Only the option of identification with FR
included the treatment of data of special categories, for which the
explicit consent.

b) On the disagreement in the legitimizing basis of the treatment that derives from the
privacy policy clause, states that not all forms of verification
of identification required the use of FR technologies and that consent
explicit is the legal basis on which the FR data have been processed, not having
discrepancies in the information provided by the defendant, in terms of whether
indicates that the basis of the treatment in the email that the claimant says

having received article 6.1 letter c) of the GDPR was indicated, since, “separately,
GSMA was required by law to provide certain information to the Mossos-
name surname nationality, date of birth, identity document
provided, date of issue and document number.”

c) Information on data transfers and treatment managers will not be

contained in the privacy policy. It was decided to provide that information to
through a page of frequently asked questions, FAQ, so that it was easily
accessible, thus appearing at https://mwcbarcelona.com/attend/event-entry/breez/breez-
faq where service providers are also contained.

Regarding the statement of the defendant that "this establishes that the opt-outs

are available, however, after correspondence by email,
this is incorrect. An opt-out is only available for virtual assistance.”

He states that in "frequently asked questions" they refer to the right to withdraw the
consent in the "How do I unsubscribe from BREEZ" section. "The interested
parses this option in the context of the registry (but is not related to the options

we received complaints that opting for a standard ID validation instead
from FR will adversely affect the conference experience.” “To MWC 2021,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/48

approximately 20,000 delegates attended and our registration team received
very few inquiries regarding identity verification processes, the
most of which were of a technical nature.

3) It states that its privacy policy was updated for the MWC 2021, being its
latest version, 04/29/2021.

4) "FR questions: FR technologies were used (when the person opted for this
option and gave their express consent) to verify the identity of the delegates in

the event, for security purposes. This happened in both cases:

-When the person registers online, that is, FR is used to compare a photo
of the person taken at the time of registration with the photo of the identity document
who climbs up them, and,

-To allow access to the event facilities, (i.e. the token was verified
biometric on the pass of the delegates) automatically against their image using
FR technologies).

As explained above, delegates were able to choose verification of

common identification, which did not imply the use of FR technologies. Instead, the
people had the option of uploading a copy of their identity document and a
photo (taken at the time they registered) which were later reviewed
manually by a third party engaged by the GSMA for these purposes. Your access
was facilitated by security personnel reviewing the image stored on your pass

made for certain types of passes.

Identity verification was not performed for the majority of delegates
who attended the event virtually.

As described above, only FR was required as one of the three options
available to register in person for the event.

As also noted above, the GSMA shared some of the information
obtained in the context of identity verification (excluding information

biometric when it is collected) with the Mossos, since it is legally required to
in accordance with article 11.1.h of Organic Law 2/1986, on Public Order. By

2021 event, in order to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19,
reducing queues and crowds at access points. This is in line
with the "action plan for congresses of the Generalitat of Catalonia" to which it is subject

to the GSMA and which expressly requires the replacement of manual processes by
digital processes Provide the link of this plan, dated 07/22/2020. Contains guidelines and
recommendations for the reduction of contagion by coronavirus for meetings and
congresses, which applies to organizers of conferences, congresses or
conventions, responsible for the implementation and coordination of measures between the
which include the preparation of a contingency plan to reduce the risks of

COVID-19.

In point 4.2.3.2 "registration and registration access control", it is indicated that for
adequately manage the entry and exit flows and the traffic of people,
establish the following general measures: encourage online procedures and payments

and the replacement whenever possible of manual processes by digital ones,
sending accreditations online, downloading accreditations on the mobile, promoting
contactless media and manage queues with separator tapes.

FR technologies are also used to improve security. The MWCB is a
event classified as a “high security threat” by the Spanish authorities.

The verification of identification with FR is effective in achieving the objective pursued,
that is, security in a contactless environment.

 Delegates who had chosen common or standard ID validation,
they used separate entry lines to those of the FR lines. They scanned your

digital pass and security staff compares the image stored on the pass
digital that was displayed on a screen in the appearance of the delegate. This was done to
some distance given the non-contact environment that the company considered little
likely to be as accurate as the identification check performed with
FR technologies especially in the context of trying to ensure a fast flow of

delegates to avoid overcrowding.

FR access identification checks were also faster, which
reduced waiting time and congestion within a closed space.”

Retained biometric data was deleted at the end of the event, only a few

weeks after registration and a few days after your treatment for control purposes
of access. These measures protect the data from being used for purposes other than the
identity validation.

The page that is included in “privacy policy” gives information about the process of

automatic identification validation, FR, leads to specific information about the
BREEZ (layers) and this page explains the possibility to choose verification of the
common identification, without the use of FR technology”.

Delegates have a real choice between checking their ID using-

do FR technologies or manually. The main difference between the two is that the option
tion FR allows the online registration process to be completed immediately,
while manual ID verification will require a short wait for
a few days to confirm the registration. This brief delay did not affect the ability

International data transfers

The GSMA has a contract with a third party service provider (ScanVis Limited), who
It is not contributed, for the provision of FR services. “Our commitment against

with ScanVis includes the requirement to implement appropriate security measures
to protect the personal data processed by the service provider and conforms

Also, as an added safeguard, biometric data is encrypted and only the al-

Gorithm itself can understand what it means.

The GSMA does not transfer personal data to Belarus or Russia, as disputed by the inter-
resada.

Appointment of an EU representative

“GSMA EVENT PROJECT MANAGEMENT, S.L. (EPM) is a Spanish subsidiary of
GSMA. EPM has been created specifically to provide services related to the
management of the MWC in Barcelona. Personal data processing activities

of the GSMA are inextricably linked to the activities of EPM.

Therefore, the GSMA processes personal data in the context of the activities of a
establishment of the EU and is subject to the GDPR pursuant to Article 3(1)
of the GDPR, so no EU representative is required in accordance with

whatever results from the instruction.”

SEVENTH: On 06/27/2022, the defendant indicates:

1) In its letter to the AEPD dated 09/10/2021, the GSMA provided detailed answers
to the questions of the AEPD. The GSMA did not interpret the question regarding the
Data Protection Impact Assessments ("DIAs") referred to the fact that
the AEPD was requesting the contribution of a copy of said EIPD, but was asking

confirmation that a DPIA had been carried out. According to this interpretation,
The GSMA confirmed that it had carried out an DPIA for the use of
facial recognition ("RF") and that the document was being updated for the
MWC22.

They reiterate that the claimant did not register in the mode of use of "RF" technology, "due to
Therefore, we do not consider that RF's EIPD was relevant for the purposes of this
specific claim and it was interpreted that way”.

2) They provide a copy of the EIPD of 01/12/2020 made using the “One Trust” system

"already existing when requested" and another that replaces it, updating it for the
MWC22. "The defendant did not ignore the need to mitigate the risks derived from the use
of RF technologies for the 2021 event”, “which took into account the
information and evaluation of the aforementioned EIPD 2020" and "the need to minimize the
risk of spread of COVID-19”, and took the following practical measures:

    a) “the optionality of biometric data processing and the measures to
ensure that the manual identity verification option (without the use of
RF) was not to the detriment of the user;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

    c) “the implementation of robust physical and technical security measures to stop

protect biometric data;”

    d) “the imposition of robust security measures on ScanVis, the provider of
RF technologies, including safety assessments by the GSMA; and

    e) “the deletion of the biometric information shortly, after the completion of the

event."

2) The impact assessment report, DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENT

          - Integration of a new widget that allows attendees to scan their
Passport/EU ID; this will extract the data from the machine readable zone (MRZ),
as well as the photograph in the identification.

          - The captured photo of the passport/EU ID is compared with the captured photo-

given during BREEZ registration to determine probability.

          - Inclusion of the concept of Secured Attendee Profile (SAP) which means
that through the automation process the wizard has:

          a) provided your passport/EU ID details
          b) has enrolled in the BREEZ FR program
          c) the EU ID/Passport photo matches the photo provided for

3. "About the aggravating circumstances of articles 83.2.a) and 83.2.b) GDPR that apply in the

resolution proposal, we request that they be reviewed and their applicability assessed in the
specific case taking into account the following arguments:

       3.1. The resolution proposal considers, regarding the aggravating circumstance of article
83.2.a) GDPR, that "the data of a very high number of attendees was processed
(20,000 people), without considering the level of high risk, in relation to the affectation

to their rights and freedoms, which may exist for treatments based on
face recognition”. On this aspect it corresponds to indicate that the RF was offered
as an optional registration measure and that, according to the information provided
According to our registration systems, the RF was only used by 7,585 people.
We request that this number be taken into account for the valuation of the amount of the

sanction. It also corresponds to indicate that there has been no record, not even during the
time that the treatment was carried out, nor after the damage occurred
or damages or any affectation to the rights and freedoms of the interested parties.

       3.2. The resolution proposal considers, regarding the aggravating circumstance of article

They have put the basic means so that it did not occur. The performance to which
the resolution proposal refers to is the breach of article 35 itself
of the GDPR. No additional circumstances are described or listed that may
valued to justify the applicability of this aggravating circumstance. In this regard, the GSMA has
submitted information that demonstrates diligence in the treatment performed, the
application of robust security measures imposed on service providers

RF services and the existence of adequate contracts with all of them. In this
sense, we do not agree that there is negligence in the infringement and
we consider that the violation of article 35 of the GDPR, by itself, cannot
entail the applicability of the aggravating factor of negligence.

                              PROVEN FACTS

1) In the terms and conditions of attendance for the MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS

(MWC) of Barcelona 2021, it appears that GSMA Ltd. ('GSMA') is the entity
organizer of the MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS (MWC) of Barcelona 2021, to
celebrate between 06/28 and 07/1/2021, and performs, among others, data processing of
the assistants. The website www.mwcbarcelona.com/legal contains information on the
Barcelona 2022 Congress, indicates that "GSMA LTD with its main place of

business located in Atlanta, USA, wholly owned subsidiary of the association
GSM, and with respect to 4yfn 2022, GSMA 4fyn EVENT MANAGEMENT S.L., a

2) In the terms and conditions of assistance, the registration process that

would allow face-to-face access for those attending the event for that 2021, it has been
to create an account on your website, and register for support, so that when
Arriving at the physical headquarters, you should already be registered. At headquarters there would be no areas of
registration support and paper credentials would not be provided. The system intended
have verification of identity collected prior to each person's arrival at
headquarters. For the year 2021, the MWC provided as mandatory in the modality of

face-to-face attendance at your headquarters, the registration of the DNI/passport, identity card,
uploading it to your website. Only it was not required to upload the identity documents to the
who opted for the “virtual” modality. These requirements are contemplated in Clause
of "general terms and conditions for attendance" MWC 2021, Barcelona" in the
that attendees have to accept these conditions.

In the terms and conditions of assistance, it is provided "Identification: You agree to arrive
var a photo identification issued by your government in the form of a passport or card
EU national ID card with you at all times during the Event. HE
You will be asked to present such identification. You are solely responsible for the accuracy

In addition, data such as "name, position, name,
company name, work address, work email, job functions, phone number
telephone, area of interest and photograph. If you are a speaker, as additional information,
your professional profile

3) The defendant indicated to the claimant that the passport and identification data
are required and are demanded by the Mossos d\`Esquadra, that the legitimizing basis for
the treatment of uploading passports and identity cards is article 6.1
c) of the GDPR inasmuch as they were required to provide certain information to the

provide it novel, for being electronic and "that has changed by 2021, due to
that businesses need a contactless environment.” The defendant does not prove this
requirement or that it should be through a website, of its own private ownership,

where they are collected and stored. The defendant pointed out that in previous editions
of the Congress, the assistants carried their identification cards in a credential.

4) In general terms and conditions for attendees it is indicated in privacy and
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 27/48

Data Protection that data is collected “about you in connection with the provision of the
services and for account management" and that more details about the privacy policy
practice on the processing of personal data is available in Privacy Policy-

city. The Privacy Policy indicates that information about the data is obtained
collected from various groups, among others, attendees, through the system of
registration of attendees, the event app, digital and/or printed credential cards,
or the facial recognition scanning system (at access points, to se-
sessions or to participate in closed space meetings). It indicates: "information
that you voluntarily provide: “when… you create an account with us, you register

after the event, ...you require a service…””The information collected includes, but
It is not limited to: your name, title, company name, work address, email
job, job functions, phone number, area of interest, and photograph. If you're
a speaker, as additional information, your professional profile”

5) The defendant explains that after taking the aforementioned identity documents,
there is the possibility when you register on the web, for face-to-face access, of two
modes, and one more residual:

  a) Automatic verification recognition, also called verification validation
automatic identity: Together with the identity documents already uploaded, the automatic identity

The website of the defendant requests the express consent to use BREEZ (acronym for
easy entry with biometric recognition) using facial recognition
biometric . In this modality you can enroll both during registration and
after registering for the event. The BREEZ system assumes that the
SCANVIS software -responsible for processing the claimant- takes a photo of

the person automatically matches the image “provided to us with the
photograph in their passport/national identity card”, “to whom it will attribute some
matching scores”, “the technology analyzes facial features, taking
measurements of the data points that make up the face, such as distance between eyes, or
from forehead to chin, a series of data points are processed to create a

map of your face in real time, this is converted into a data pattern using a
algorithm to create what the defendant calls a "biometric token" (biometric file,
identifier). This token is what makes it possible for your captured image to be accessed
by the FR reader matches and the event is accessed in its own differentiated queues,
for sessions or to participate in meetings in closed spaces or even areas
restricted.

In the non-contact accesses with BREEZ, it is indicated that "it will verify your image
captured by cameras against your biometric token for validation purposes
of identification”.

The consent information in BREEZ states that “You consent to
GSMA using your biometric data obtained from photographs provided by
you for identification validation purposes in the context of online registration
and for the MWC Barcelona for the purpose of accessing the venue”, preceded by a
chair that indicates "Yes, I consent to the use of my biometric data for self-validation

identity mathematics”.

It bases the purpose in a double sense, to verify the identity when attending the
event, and security in the access to the enclosure. The legal basis of this treatment according to

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 28/48

indicate it would be express consent, being able to withdraw their consent with what
its validation would become manual.

Information on the BREEZZ system is expanded in the BREEZ FAQS -FR section
The consent granted for the automatic validation of the identity can be
withdraw at any time

 a) Acknowledgment of manual verification, or manual validation of identity: Together
to the identity documents already uploaded, the web program of the claimed

Take a photo of the attendee. It implies that access will occur with
control through human presence, which performs the verification when the assistant
when approaching, he scans his digital credential in the form of a QR reading, showing the
photo taken that sees the human presence at the same time as the person.

b) Exceptionally, validation of identification on paper, face-to-face on site
2) The one called by the defendant: "biometric token" created for the process of
image comparison will be removed four (4) weeks after completion
of the event. Check the section How is my biometric data used and stored?
that each biometric token is encrypted and stored in a separate database from the
raw data used in its creation

However, in the BREEZ FAQS it is indicated that although it has no contact,
all attendees must have their digital credential available to enter the
external perimeter of the place and that the digital credential will also be the only way to
access conferences and their partner sessions.

3) According to the defendant, the SCANVIS entity with which it has an assignment
treatment of the facial recognition system for access to the headquarters,
located in a country outside the EU, and the GSMA has entered into contractual clauses
standard with SCANVIS. It adds that the MWC FR data is hosted by Amazon

Web Services (“AWS”) in Germany.

4) The defendant stated that at MWC 2019, she allowed paper copies of
identification documents will be manually verified when accessing the headquarters of
MWC, an option that in 2021 was suppressed -with some exceptions- for reasons of health and

security, in order to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19,
reducing queues and crowds at access points. This is in line
with the "action plan for congresses of the Generalitat of Catalonia" to which it is subject to
the GSMA and that expressly requires the replacement of manual processes by processes
digital.

5) According to the claim to MWC 2021, approximately 20,000 people attended.

10) Before the 2021 MWC, the defendant had a document of
IMPACT ASSESSMENT that is provided in allegations, entitled: "MWC20
Facial recognition process”, created on 12/17/2019. It has nine sections with
answer yes/no, related to the principles of data protection, appearing zero

in all kinds of risks, residual risk, none. In several issues he reproduces the
GDPR article, and the answer: Yes (example 4.5, 4.4, 4.6 among others) In the first
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 29/48

section: "general", it is indicated that "it is a new version of the
updated facial recognition for 2020” (in which events dated
in Congress in 2020, none in 2021), and that the “term BREEZ is the term

customer-oriented for our facial recognition process.” It is a review of
2019 project, which includes its changes since then, referring to the
BREEZ performance. In the section How would you assess the importance of
need for treatment operations? (5.2) does not indicate the activity of
treatment of facial recognition, indicating: "In order to satisfy the measures
security at the event, we have been instructed by the Police Form

Española to put strict processes in place to ensure that all
attendees are screened through a passport/ID check

credentials. Legacy processes are based on manual checks that
they can be slow and provide a negative experience at the event. Through the use of

the technology described in this DPIA, we may automate them to enable a more
much more efficient process, as well as a more accurate and secure event.”

In section 5.3 on the proportionality of processing operations, only
indicates that yes, "to satisfy the requirements, it is necessary to create tokens
photo-based biometrics. The document lacks an evaluation of the

necessity and proportionality of processing operations with respect to their
purpose; the use of facial recognition for access to events, of your

risks, including guarantees, security measures and mechanisms that guarantee

the protection of personal data, and to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR,
taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of the data subjects and other
affected people. Likewise, it relates the data of the passports and cards of
identity that he manifests are required by the Mossos d\`Esquadra that allegedly
have a purpose, to connect it with the photo that is taken with the software, that
initiates the facial recognition process, matching your identity to facilitate the

access.

According to the terms in which the claim is formulated, it is always mandatory
Before going to the Congress, its headquarters and its events, register at the

website of the claimed party, so when you arrive you must already be registered. It
It is carried out with the creation of an account and the registration on the web of the claimed party.
It is mandatory in general, when the registration on the web is attended in person with
the introduction on said website, in the form of uploading the document (ID card, or passport,
for security reasons required according to that claimed by the Mossos d\`Esquadra, and
a photo for identification purposes at the accesses of the event, documents of

This requirement in data processing has not been specifically analyzed in this
procedure, but if it is indicated by the defendant that for this 2021, this process has
changed, “being provided electronically”, “by the contactless environment”. Seems
It may be that in other years these documents were shown when accessing the premises, limiting

partly the intrusion that the processing of these data supposes to their owners the
have to upload them to a website owned by the claimed. In 2021 it was mandatory, not pa-
considering that, for convenience, data can be collected that could be excessive,
when before there was room for a mere exhibition of the document, especially in the case of documents

people at all times

Nor is it clear how it transfers the identifying data it collects from each
assistant the one claimed to the Mossos d\`Esquadra, if he delivers the identification document
that attendees upload the claimant's website and the photo, or only give the data that
precise, which would oblige her to extract them one by one by people dedicated to it.

When trying to promote non-contact due to the pandemic, instead of displaying the document,
the defendant keeps a copy of it.

In any case, the defendant should reassess whether she has legitimacy for this
treatment activity.

In addition, the Congress attendee is given a credential or digital card that
contains your data. The assistant in virtual mode, not face-to-face, was not required to

The common modality of registration in terms of access is manual validation, which

sample and scanning it, an employee verifies that the accessing person matches
that of the photograph and the documents that it bears in the credentials

Another method of registering and accessing involves entering the same data, but

giving consent, marking a box for it, which would associate the same
documents for an easy entry mode, through recognition

In this way, with the passport, or DNI, as mandatory, with no alternative, plus the

facial recognition, we proceed in a bivalent way to an identification with double

more agile to installation. It ensures that it is that person by the uploaded documents
to the web and by the biometric template that manages the same web of the one claimed to

On the other hand, in treatments without facial recognition, it is also saving
the photo, which is unknown if it is also managed by SCANVIS in its program that
is on the claim website, and if any pairing is made with the

The proactive responsibility system implemented by the GDPR, focused on the
continuous management of the potential risks associated with the treatment, imposes on the
data controllers who analyze what data they process, for what purposes and what

types of treatments carried out, relating the potential risks to which they are
exposed and from there, decide what measures to take and apply to ensure their
compliance based
of the risks detected and assumed.

The impact assessment on the protection of personal data, EIPD, is the
tool that in the GDPR deals with the guarantee of compliance with this
treatment aspect.

In the text of the GDPR there is no definition for the term "assessment of

impact on data protection" or EIPD. The CEPD does develop the definition
of EIPD in the WP248 Guidelines as: “…a process designed to describe the
treatment, assess its necessity and proportionality, and help manage risks
for the rights and freedoms of natural persons derived from the processing of data
personal coughs by evaluating them and determining measures to address them.” According to
For this, the CEPD considers that the EIPD is a "process" and, therefore:

• Reducing the EIPD to a specific and isolated activity in time is incompatible with the
process concept that interprets the WP248 Guidelines.

• The EIPD must be documented, but the EIPD is more than the report that reflects

Your results.

• The EIPD must assess the risks “determining the measures to address them”. The
EIPD obliges the person in charge to act and has a greater dimension than a mere form-

isism embodied in a document on which minimal changes can be made
to adapt it to any treatment.

The EIPD is a process of analyzing a treatment that extends over time, over

GDPR provisions.

Biometric processing presents, among others, the following risks, some of which
which are contemplated in Opinion 3/2012 on the evolution of technologies
biometrics of GT 29 of 04/27/2012:

-The definition of the size (amount of information) of the biometric template is a
crucial question. On the one hand, the size of the template must be large enough

to manage security (avoiding overlaps between the different data
biometrics, or identity substitutions), and on the other, it should not be too large
in order to avoid the risks of reconstruction of biometric data

-Risks involved in the use of biometric data for identification purposes in

large centralized databases, given the potential consequences
harmful to the people affected.

-It goes without saying that any loss of the qualities of integrity, confidentiality
and availability with respect to the databases would clearly be detrimental to
any future application based on the information contained in said databases

data, and would also cause irreparable damage to the data subjects. For example, if the
registered data of an authorized person will be associated with the identity of a
unauthorized person, the latter could access the services available to the
owner of the data, without having the right to do so. The result would be identity theft,
that (regardless of its detection) would make the system unreliable for future

applications and, consequently, would limit their freedom.

-The transfer of information contained in the database.

-It can create the illusion that identification through the face is always
correct, for this reason an analysis of the errors that can occur in

its use, performance evaluation meters, false acceptance rate-
probability that a biometric system will incorrectly identify an individual or
do not reject an individual who does not belong to the group, and rate of false rejection or false

Faced with decisions that legally affect a person, any decision that

is adopted based on this, such as in registration and time control systems, the
deduction of fees for registration with the system, which should only be made
safeguarding the rights and freedoms and the legitimate interests of the data subject,
at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to
express their point of view and challenge the decision.

-Linking: A large number of online services allow users to upload a
image to link it to the user's profile. The RF can be used to link the
profiles of different online services (via profile picture), but also
between the online and offline world. It is not out of the question to take a

photograph of a person on the street and determine their identity in real time
looking at these public profile pictures. Third party services may also
track profile photos and other publicly available photos to create
large collections of images in order to associate a real world identity with

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 42/48

such images. This impact increases with the increasing deployment of these
technologies. Each individual can appear in one or several biometric systems.

-Security measures must be adopted for data processing
biometrics (storage, transmission, extraction of characteristics and

comparison, etc.) and especially if the data controller transmits such data
via Internet. Security measures could include, for example, the
encryption of templates and protection of encryption keys apart from the
access control and protection that makes it virtually impossible to
reconstruction of the original data from the templates. Additionally, use of
realistic or photo use masks to try to trick the system, always on

connection with the advances and the state of the art, taking into account that the
biometric systems that are more effective when it comes to recognizing a person are also
the most potentially vulnerable

Likewise, the working document on biometrics, adopted on 08/01/2003 by GT29,
is of the opinion that biometric systems relating to physical characteristics that do not allow

trace (for example the shape of the hand, but not fingerprints) or systems
biometrics relating to physical characteristics that leave a trace but do not depend on the
storage of data held by a person other than the interested party (in other
words, the data is not stored in the access control device or in a
central database) create fewer risks for the protection of rights and
fundamental freedoms of people (Biometric data can be distinguished

that are processed centrally from the biometric reference data that is
stored on a mobile device and the compliance process is performed on the card
and not on the sensor or when it is part of the mobile device).

-It is generally accepted that the risk of reusing biometric data obtained
from physical traces left by people inadvertently (for example: footprints

digital) for incompatible purposes is relatively low if the data is not
stored in centralized databases, but in the possession of the person and are
inaccessible to third parties. Centralized storage of biometric data
it also increases the risk of using biometric data as a key to
interconnect different databases, which could allow obtaining profiles
details of a person's habits both publicly and privately. Besides,

the question of the compatibility of the purposes leads us to the interoperability of
different systems that use biometrics. The standardization required
interoperability can lead to greater interconnection between databases.

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed in the present case for the violation of article 35 of the GDPR, of the

that the claimed entity is held responsible, are deemed concurrent as
aggravating the following factors that reveal a greater illegality and/or
guilt in his conduct:

-Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR: "a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement,

taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation
in question as well as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damage and
damages they have suffered”.

Data from a very high number of attendees, 20,000, were processed without considering the

high level of risk in relation to the impact on their rights and freedoms that
may exist for treatments based on facial recognition for access to the
Congress.

- Article 83.2.b of the GDPR, "intentionality or negligence in the infringement". I don't know
is aware that the entity has acted fraudulently, although the action

reveals a serious lack of diligence in your conduct in taking action
precise proactive measures in such a unique, differentiated and special regime applicable to the type
of data that it deals with, without it being stated that the basic means have been put in place so that
did not occur. In this regard, what was declared in the Judgment of the
National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006) which, based on the fact that it is

entities whose activity involves continuous data processing, indicates that
“…the Supreme Court has been understanding that imprudence exists whenever
disregards a legal duty of care, that is, when the offender does not behave
with the due diligence. And in assessing the degree of diligence, consideration must be
especially the professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case

now examined, when the appellant's activity is of constant and abundant
handling of personal data must insist on rigor and exquisite care
for complying with the legal provisions in this regard”.

-Article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD “b) The link between the activity of the infringer and the
processing of personal data." The indisputable link between
activity of the defendant with the performance of data processing of a

staff, at least natural persons attending this type of massive event that
has been organizing for a long time (art 76.2.b of the GDPR).

In relation to the mitigations sought by the defendant:

-Estimating that the infringement was not continued, it only lasted from 03/22/2021 and ceased
four weeks after the end of the event, 07/29/2021.

The system was used every day and during the entire period of the Congress. The number
of daily attendees was presumably in the thousands, so even though
Outside of that space of time, its use was intensive and massive.

-Regarding collaboration by providing what is requested by the AEPD, it must be indicated that the
Article 5.2 of the GDPR, based on the principle of proactive responsibility, must be

interpreted broadly, in the sense that the data controller must
not only demonstrate that the data processing complies with the provisions of the same, in
In this case, before implementing biometric data, prepare an EIPD, and must

also prove that all the necessary conditions are met for said
treatment takes effect. Therefore, the collaboration and contribution of documents
to certify that the treatment conforms to the regulations is a minimum required, which
therefore, it must not produce any mitigation in case of infringement.

-Regarding the mitigating factor that the audience was familiar with the

technologies and can choose the RF option, the procedure does not start and resolve
for said use, but for not foreseeing the evaluation of the impact of the treatment.

In addition to the above, it adds that minors in the few cases that were
with an assistant, with them the F system was not used. This allusion to add it as

a mitigating factor in the sanction, it is still purely secondary and episodic, when
nothing has been specified about the minors in the procedure, their reference being
purely marginal, and not being attended to, being also analyzed, the validity
before processing the RF of a valid EIPD.

-Finally, not having committed previous infractions cannot serve as

extenuating

As a consequence, with the elements that are available, the sanction is quantified in
200,000 euros.

                                           VII

Article 58.2 of the GDPR provides the following: "Each control authority shall have

of all of the following corrective powers listed below:

\[…\]”

i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of

the measures mentioned in this paragraph, according to the circumstances of each
particular case;"

"d) order the controller or processor that the processing operations
compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in accordance with
a certain manner and within a specified period;”

"The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administration, according to the provisions of art. 83.2 of the GDPR.”

Article 36.1 and 2 of the GDPR establishes:

"1. The person in charge shall consult the control authority before proceeding to the
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 47/48

processing when an impact assessment relating to data protection in
under Article 35 shows that the processing would entail a high risk if the
responsible does not take measures to mitigate it.

2. When the supervisory authority considers that the planned treatment referred to
paragraph 1 could infringe this Regulation, in particular where the
responsible has not sufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the control authority
control must, within a period of eight weeks from the request for consultation,
advise in writing the person in charge, and where appropriate the person in charge, and may use

any of its powers mentioned in article 58. Said term may
extended by six weeks, depending on the complexity of the planned treatment. The
control authority will inform the person in charge and, where appropriate, the person in charge of such
extension within one month from receipt of the consultation request,
indicating the reasons for the delay. These terms may be suspended until the
supervisory authority has obtained the information requested for the purposes of the consultation.”

In this case, only the required impact assessment has been assessed before
of data processing of the facial recognition system for access to MWC
of 2021, without questioning that of 2022.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria of
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been accredited,
