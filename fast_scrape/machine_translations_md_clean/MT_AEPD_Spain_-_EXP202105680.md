## English Summary

### Facts

On November 2021, in order to participate in a handball competition, the data subject was required to upload, on the Federación de Balonmano de Castilla y La Mancha website, a certificate of the complete vaccination against COVID or a certificate of having recovered from the disease or an antigen test with a negative result 48 hours prior to the sporting event.

Allegedly, the controller discriminated competitors based on health data they collected, given that only competitors with the presentation of the corresponding certificate of vaccination against COVID-19 or the presentation of antigen tests could play indoors without a mask.

Also, the controller also did not provide information on the data retention period and other aspects provided for in [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

In January 2022, the controller replied and in its response highlighted that due to the evolution of the epidemiological situation and the appearance of variants or the effectiveness, it has stopped processing the data related to COVID in order to participate in the competitions.

### Holding

In its conclusion, the Spanish DPA considered that the requirement of submitting health data in order to participate in the competition without a mask by federated athletes does not fall under the requirements of [EU Regulation 2021/953](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021R0953), which created and established the COVID certificate. Also, there is no other legal justification or basis for the processing, violating [Article 9 GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR")

AEPD highlighted that Recital 46 GDPR already recognizes that, in exceptional situations, such as an epidemic, the legal basis for processing may be multiple, based on both the public interest and the vital interest of the data subject or another natural person.

In this case, the data was collected in the private area of the website managed by the Federation as part of the "safe play without mask protocol-season 21/22". Despite the fact that the website could have provided information on the collection of data, there is no explanation or legal justification about such collection and there is no explanation about the establishment of the way and procedure for reporting the data, thus proving the non-compliance with [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

Recital (46) of the GDPR already recognizes that, in exceptional situations, such as an epi-
demia, the legal basis of the treatments can be multiple, based both on the public interest

(46) The processing of personal data should also be considered lawful when necessary

In principle, personal data should only be processed on the basis of the vital interest of another
natural person when the processing cannot manifestly be based on a legal basis
different. Certain types of treatment may respond to both important reasons of interest
public and the vital interests of the interested party, such as when the treatment is

necessary for humanitarian purposes, including the control of epidemics and their spread, or in
humanitarian emergency situations, especially in the event of natural disasters or
human origin.

Article 6.1.d) of the GDPR considers not only that vital interest is a sufficient legal basis for
treatment to protect the “interested party”, in this case the athletes who face each other

yes, but that said legal basis can be used to protect the vital interests “of another
natural person”, which by extension means that they can be either unidentified persons or
identifiable, as unnamed, in terms of holding an interest worthy of being safeguarded.
Furthermore, it does not follow, as stated in article 6.3 of the RGPD, that the need to
that the basis of treatment for reasons of vital interest must be established by the right of

Union or Member State law applicable to the controller, such as

Of the following articles included in article 9.2 of the RGPD, which are cited and which
can prove the eventual legality of the processing of the data of the certificates required in

The claimant states that the following would be applicable:

a) In the RAT it only mentions “Art. 6.1 d) Protection of vital interests of the interested party or of
another natural person. In this treatment, the vital interests to be protected are those of the people
who practice the sport of Handball, and only in reference to the practice of said sport by
all federated people.” However, the alleged provision is not one that allows
this type of data processing.

b) In its statements it includes it within the framework of Regulation 2021/953 (certificate

EU digital COVID) and adds g) of article 9.2 of the GDPR “the treatment is necessary

The legal basis of the proposal was article 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union

ity and proportionality. The entities that can access the certificate are limited to the
competent authorities of the Member State of destination and to cross-border operators of
passenger transportation services airlines and shipping companies that have the obligation to collaborate
with said authorities.

Regulation 2021/953 is related to the possibility of Member States to limit the
fundamental right to free movement for reasons of public health, and culminates the approach

coordinated restriction of the free movement of people in response to the pandemic
within the EU. Its recital 48 indicates:

“Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council applies to the processing
of personal data made when applying this Regulation. This Regulation
establishes the legal basis for the processing of personal data within the meaning of the article

6(1)(c) and Article 9(2)(g) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
necessary for the issuance and verification of the interoperable certificates established in
this Regulation. It does not regulate the processing of personal data related to the
documentation of a vaccination, diagnostic test or recovery for other purposes,
such as pharmacovigilance or maintenance of personal medical records. The states

Members may process personal data for other purposes if the legal basis for their processing

certificate, as well as relevant safeguards to prevent discrimination and abuse,
taking into account the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. When the
certificate is used for non-medical purposes, personal data accessed during the
verification process must not be kept, as provided in this Regulation.”

Thus, the main objective of the Regulation is that identified in its article 1: “to establish a
framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of COVID-19 certificates to facilitate the

free movement of its holders during the pandemic and contribute to the gradual elimination of

Regarding the added article 9.2.g) of the RGPD, there is no mention of the law of the Union or of the
Member States that foresee the need for those reasons of essential public interest, and
which should, on the other hand, essentially respect the right to data protection and

Thus, it is considered that the defendant does not meet the requirement that it alleges as an exception to the

On the other hand, it follows that the claim considered in this case a purpose
specifically related to COVID 19, has not proven that it reports the extremes that
must contain the collection of data in this case, which would violate article 13 of the RGPD,

which indicates:

“For natural persons it must be completely clear that they are collecting, using,
consulting or otherwise processing personal data that concerns them, as well as the

In accordance with the evidence available, it is considered that the facts

exposed could violate the provisions of articles: 9 and 13 of the RGPD, with the scope
expressed in the previous Fundamentals of Law, which means the commission of the
infringements classified in article 83 section 5.a) and b) of the RGPD that under the rubric
“General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines” provides that:

“Infringements of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with section
2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company,

previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:
a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent to

 wording of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;
b) the rights of the interested parties under articles 12 to 22.”

acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this organic law.”

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 of the LOPDGDD, indicates:

“Infringements considered very serious.
