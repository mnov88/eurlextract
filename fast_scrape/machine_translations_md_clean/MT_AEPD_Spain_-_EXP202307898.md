## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject downloaded an app called “Shop Buo” on her phone and uninstalled it the same day. She started receiving emails from the same company (“controller”). She unsubscribed from the newsletter via the link included in the commercial email and received confirmation of the unsubscription.

The next month, she received another commercial email from the controller. The data subject then sent an email to the address provided on the controller’s website but she received an email indicating that the email address does not exist.

She therefore decided to lodge a complaint with the Spanish DPA (“AEPD”).

### Holding

Firstly, the AEPD considered that under Article 21 of the Spanish Law 34/2002 on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce (Ley 34/2002, de 11 de julio, de Servicios de la Sociedad de la Información y Comercio Electrónico (LSSI)), the sending of promotional communications by email that have not been previously requested or expressly authorized by the recipients of said communications is prohibited. The AEPD considered it appropriate to impose a €2,500 fine for the infringement of this Article.

Secondly, the AEPD pointed out that [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR") provides the data subject with the right to object to the processing of their personal data. The DPA held that the fact that the controller provided an email address which did not actually exist or could not be accessed constitutes a breach of [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"). The AEPD imposed a 5,000€ fine for the infringement of this Article.

Therefore, the AEPD imposed a €7,500 fine in total for the infringement of Spanish national law and [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR").

said email address was invalid or did not exist.

                                          III.-1
   Classification of the infringement committed by sending commercial communications

The fact that the defendant sends advertising emails to the complainant
having requested that they not send him more advertising constitutes a violation
of what is established in article 21 of the LSSI, as it establishes the following:

       "1. Sending advertising or promotional communications is prohibited

       by email or other equivalent means of electronic communication
       that had not previously been requested or expressly authorized by
       the recipients of these.

       2. The provisions of the previous section will not apply when there is a

       prior contractual relationship, provided that the provider had obtained
       lawfully authorizes the contact details of the recipient and will use them to send the
       commercial communications referring to products or services of its own
       company that are similar to those that were initially subject to
       contracting with the client.

       In any case, the provider must offer the recipient the possibility of
       oppose the processing of your data for promotional purposes through a

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12

       simple and free procedure, both at the time of data collection
       as in each of the commercial communications that I send to you.

       When the communications have been sent by email,
       said means must necessarily consist of the inclusion of an address

       email or other valid electronic address where you can
       exercise this right, being prohibited the sending of communications that
       do not include said address.”
                                          III.-2
                                        Sanction

The aforementioned violation of article 21 of the LSSI is classified as minor in the
art. 38.4.d) of said standard, which qualifies as such, “The sending of communications
commercial by email or other means of electronic communication
equivalent when said shipments do not meet the requirements established in the
article 21 and does not constitute a serious infraction.”

In accordance with these criteria, it is considered appropriate to impose a penalty of 2,500
euros, (two thousand five hundred euros), for the violation of article 21 of the LSSI, by sending
advertising messages to the claimant, having previously opposed it.

                                         IV.-1

       such provisions. The data controller will stop processing the data
       personal data, unless compelling legitimate reasons for the processing are proven.
       that prevail over the interests, rights and freedoms of the
       interested party, or for the formulation, exercise or defense of claims.

       2. When the processing of personal data aims to

       unless necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out by
       reasons of public interest.”

of the processing a series of rights regarding said data, and therefore, the fact
that the email address indicated by the person responsible for the website,

hola@pulpo.club to be able to contact him does not actually exist or is not

Furthermore, to the application of the corrective powers that article 58 of the aforementioned
