## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is Birthlink, a company providing after adoption services that maintains the adoption contact register for Scotland. This enables adopted people, birth parents, adoptive relatives and birth relatives to register their details with a view to being ‘linked’ and potentially being reunited. Birthlink maintained manual records stored in filing cabinets containing documents relating to an adopted person’s individual circumstances.

In April 2021, records containing sensitive personal data of about 4,800 individuals were destroyed without a clear approval from the board. Some of the files destroyed contained irreplaceable items.

In September 2023, following internal investigations, Birthlink notified the Data Protection Authority (Information Commissioner's Office- ICO) about the breach.

### Holding

First, the DPA established that the manual records formed part of a ‘filing system’ as defined by Article 4(6) UK GDPR.

Second, the DPA held that Birthlink violated Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR, the principle of integrity and confidentiality and Article 32(1) and Article 32(2) UK GDPR, security of processing, for failing to ensure appropriate security and organisational measures to the processing of the personal data. In particular, it failed to implement a data retention policy, a data destruction policy, any sufficient internal approval process for the destruction of the files and any data protection training for members of staff.

Third, the DPA found that it violated the principle of accountability, pursuant to Article 5(2) UK GDPR. In the absence of appropriate policies, procedures and staff training, Birthlink was not able to demonstrate compliance with its obligations under Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR.

Third, it held that Birthlink breached Article 33 UK GDPR by failing to notify the DPA within 72 hours of the personal data breach.

Lastly, the DPA imposed a fine of GBP 18,000 (€20,707). For the calculation of the fine it took into account the irreplaceable nature and sensitivity of the destroyed data, the seriousness of the infringement and high risk to affected individuals' rights.

PENALTY NOTICE
TO: Birthlink
OF: 21 Castle Street

EH2 3DN
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
1. Pursuant to section 155(1) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA”), the
Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) by this written notice
(“Penalty Notice”), requires Birthlink to pay a monetary penalty of
£18,000.
2. This Penalty Notice is given in respect of infringements of the UK General
Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”)1. This Penalty Notice contains
the reasons why the Commissioner has decided to impose a penalty,
including the circumstances of the infringements and the nature of the
personal data involved.
1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, as it forms
part of the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland by virtue of section 3 of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018.
For the period 25 May 2018 to 31 December 2020, references in this Notice to the UK GDPR should be read as
references to the GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on
the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such
data) as it applied in the UK during that period.

3. In accordance with paragraph 2 of Schedule 16 to the DPA, the
Commissioner gave a notice of intent to Birthlink on 20 January 2025,
setting out the reasons why the Commissioner proposed to give Birthlink
a penalty notice. In that notice of intent, the Commissioner indicated
that the amount of the penalty he proposed to impose was £45,000.
4. On 12 February 2025, Birthlink sought a short extension of time to make
representations. On 25 February 2025, Birthlink made written
representations about the Commissioner’s intention to give a penalty
notice2. On 19 March 2025 Birthlink made oral representations about the
Commissioner’s intention to give a penalty notice at an oral
representations meeting.
5. Following the oral representations meeting, on 19 March 2025 Birthlink
provided the Commissioner with supplemental information to support
the representations made.3
6. This Penalty Notice takes into account the entirety of the written and oral
representations from Birthlink and where appropriate, makes specific
reference to them.
7. Having carefully considered the facts of the case and the Birthlink’s
representations, the Commissioner finds Birthlink infringed the following
provisions of the UK GDPR:
a. Article 5(1)(f) (‘integrity and confidentiality’ principle)
b. Article 5(2) (‘accountability’ principle)
2 Birthlink provided a further risk assessment (“the February 2025 Risk Assessment) as part of the written
representations

impacts of historic forced adoption- a trauma lens”.

c. Article 32(1)-(2) (‘security of processing’)
d. Article 33 (‘notification of a personal data breach to the
Commissioner’)
8. The infringements are set out in detail in this Penalty Notice but in
summary:
a. In April 2021, Birthlink destroyed manual records containing
personal data of approximately 4,800 of its service users
without authorisation or lawful basis (“Relevant Processing”).
The Relevant Processing affected records that contained
sensitive information relating to adoption cases with a Scottish
connection, some of which were irreplaceable.4
b. The Relevant Processing occurred as a result of Birthlink’s
failure to implement appropriate organisational measures
ensuring the security of the personal data contained in the
records. The implementation of such measures would, in all
likelihood, have prevented the destruction of the records. In
this regard, the Commissioner finds that Birthlink contravened
Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1)-(2) of the UK GDPR.
c. A significant contributing factor leading to the Relevant
Processing was Birthlink’s failure to demonstrate compliance
with the data protection principles in accordance with Article
5(2) of the UK GDPR. Birthlink has accepted that there was
limited understanding of the UK GDPR at the time of the
4 In written representations Birthlink estimated that 10% of files contained irreplaceable items.

Relevant Processing until around March 2023 when it
introduced data protection training for its staff.5
d. Despite acknowledging the high risk to affected service users
arising from the Relevant Processing, Birthlink did not notify the
Commissioner of the personal data breach until 8 September
2023. A delay of two years and five months represents a
marked departure from the obligation to notify the
Commissioner within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal
data breach in accordance with Article 33(1) UK GDPR.
9. In deciding to give this Penalty Notice, the Commissioner has had regard
to the matters listed in Articles 83(1)-(2) UK GDPR. The Commissioner
is satisfied that the imposition of a financial penalty is an effective,
proportionate and dissuasive measure.
10. Having had regard to the matters listed in articles 83(1)-(2) UK GDPR
and in accordance with his Data Protection Fining Guidance6, the
Commissioner has determined the amount of the penalty as £18,000.
II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THIS PENALTY NOTICE
11. The legal framework relevant to the Commissioner’s findings of
infringement of the UK GDPR is produced at Annex 2 to this Penalty
Notice.
12. The legal framework relevant to the Commissioner’s setting of penalties
is set out in Section VI of this Penalty Notice (‘Calculation of penalty’).

13. This section summarises the relevant background to the Commissioner’s
findings of infringement. It does not seek to provide an exhaustive
account of the events that have led to the issue of this Penalty Notice.
As set out where relevant below, the Commissioner has taken into
account the further information provided by Birthlink in its
representations.
A. Birthlink
14. Birthlink is a charity registered with the Office of the Scottish Charity
Regulator with charity number SC013007.
15. Since 1984, Birthlink has maintained the Adoption Contact Register for
Scotland. This enables adopted people, birth parents, adoptive relatives
and birth relatives to register their details with a view to being ‘linked’
and potentially being reunited.
16. Birthlink primarily provides specialised post-adoption support and advice
for adults who have been affected by adoption with a Scottish
connection. It also provides similar support and advice to other partner
organisations to help people understand their time in care or trace
estranged family members (for example, Care Connect Service working
with Future Pathways).7
17. Birthlink maintains manual records with a view to a ‘link’ being made on
the Adoption Contact Register. The manual records contain the Adoption
Contact Register application form (for which there also will be an entry
on the digital system). The manual records are stored in filing cabinets
7 Care Connect Service helps adults who have been in care connect with their past, working with Future Pathways to
assist individuals who have been in care locate and understand care records; research and compile family trees; and
act as an intermediary to reconnect with family members (see: https://future-pathways.co.uk/meet-the-partner-
birthlink/) \[last accessed 11 June 2025\].

and contain documents relating to an adopted person’s individual
circumstances. The manual records form part of a ‘filing system’
pursuant to Article 4(6) UK GDPR.
18. Where a link has previously been made on the Adoption Contact Register
for clients of the post-adoption service (i.e. the person searching for their
family member has been informed that a match has been made) the
manual records are classified by Birthlink as “Linked Records”.
19. Whilst the personal data contained within the Linked Records in each
individual case varies, Birthlink informed the Commissioner that such
records may have included:
a. Original birth certificates
b. Adoption Contact Register application form
c. Correspondence between Birthlink and service users
d. Other information relevant to the adoption
e. Irreplaceable items (e.g. handwritten letters from birth parents
and birth families, photographs and other sensitive personal
information).8
B. Destruction of Linked Records
20. Between January and April 2021, considered
whether there were any barriers to the destruction of the Linked Records
to create space within Birthlink’s filing cabinets.9

21. A summary of minutes taken at a board meeting on 26 January 2021
indicates that the destruction of Linked Records was raised at board level
with the suggestion that the following retention periods should apply to
certain files within the Linked Records:10
a. 100 years | Family care and fostering files
b. Two years | Adoption support files
c. One year | Future Pathways
22. A summary of minutes taken at a management team meeting on 2
February 2021 records that:11
a. considered there to be no barriers to the destruction
of the Linked Records provided that Birthlink maintained adoption
and care files for 75 to 100 years;
b. consulted with on the legality of
deleting the Linked Records (although no substantive detail
relating to that consultation was recorded); and
c. it was agreed Future Pathways files should also be kept for one
year with the remaining Linked Records destroyed.
23. During the Commissioner’s investigation, Birthlink was unable to
produce any contemporaneous evidence indicating that the board was
made aware of the content of the Linked Records. Birthlink accepts that
the size and impact of the proposed destruction of Linked Records would
10 Birthlink internal investigation report dated September 2023 at p.8
11 Birthlink internal investigation report dated September 2023 at p.2

9
have required “clear board approval” and that this approval does not
appear to have been sought.12
24. A summary of minutes taken at a management team meeting on 2 March
2021 notes that the destruction of the Linked Records would wait until
team members had returned to the office following the Covid period.13
25. On 13 April 2021, at a follow-up management meeting it was recorded
that the Linked Records would be destroyed on Thursday of that week
(i.e. 15 April 2021).14 No contemporaneous record was kept of the
destruction of the Linked Records so Birthlink has determined the date
of destruction by reference to these meeting minutes only.15
26. A summary of minutes taken at a management team meeting on 25 May
2021 notes that the Linked Records had been ‘culled’ but not destroyed
on 15 April 2021. The minutes note that 40 bags of Linked Records were
ready to be shredded on Thursday of that week (i.e. 27 May 2021).
27. By its own admission, Birthlink accepts that there was limited
understanding of the UK GDPR within the organisation. At the time, it
had not implemented any data protection policies or procedures16 and
its staff had not received any data protection training. Such training was
not provided to staff until March 2023.17
28. In the absence of appropriate policy documents and relevant board
approval, the decision to destroy the Linked Records was left to

who had not received any formal data protection
training.
29. In the circumstances, the destruction of the Linked Records had not
received the relevant approval and was therefore unauthorised.
C. Birthlink’s Internal Investigation and Notification
30. The Relevant Processing was brought to the attention of Birthlink’s
Interim Chief Executive Officer following a “short notice inspection” by
the Care Inspectorate which took place between 23 and 29 August 2023,
and completed on 5 September 2023. In its report, the Care Inspectorate
noted:
a. There had been a “significant loss of information provided by
people who use the service… which has the capacity to impact
people’s experiences and outcomes seriously and negatively”.18
b. The information lost was “crucial information”.19
c. Birthlink “did not take a comprehensive approach in relation to risk
management and planning in respect of this activity, giving due
consideration to the special nature of the information held”.20
31. As a result of its findings, the Care Inspectorate required Birthlink to
carry out a review of the Relevant Processing by 15 December 2023.
32. Following the conclusion of the Care Inspectorate’s inspection, Birthlink:

a. notified the Commissioner of a personal data breach on 8
September 2023; and
b. conducted an internal investigation into the Relevant Processing21
(the findings of which were reported to the Commissioner in
October 2023).
33. As part of its internal investigation, Birthlink reviewed contemporaneous
documentary material relating to the Relevant Processing and obtained
personal accounts from the members of staff involved. The findings of
the internal investigation highlight the following relevant points:
a. The consulted by prior to the
Relevant Processing recalled being “very clear that
should only destroy records that could be replaced (i.e. records
found in national databases) and that they should set a realistic
retention period”.22
b. The also recalled informing that “it
would take time to go through files” and “suggested a list of all
types of paperwork that could be contained in the files be created,
then use that list to note what could and couldn't be destroyed”.23
c. At the time of the Relevant Processing, felt
“uncomfortable shredding people’s photographs and cards” and
raised their concerns with . In response to

those concerns, was told “it needed to be
done”.24
d. Contrary to the views of who was consulted,
recalled there being “no thorough check of what
was on the files” – they were “just ripped out and put in bags”.25
e. The noted that they were “unaware that non-
replaceable personal items such as letters from birth parents had
been destroyed” or that “entire files were destroyed without being
reviewed” contrary to their previous advice.
34. The Commissioner acknowledges that the personal accounts provided
during Birthlink’s internal investigation post-date the Relevant
Processing by two years and five months. The Commissioner has taken
this into consideration when assessing the weight to place on such
accounts.
D. Impact of the Relevant Processing
Affected individuals
35. In its notification to the Commissioner, Birthlink admits that it does not
know how many individuals may have been affected.26 In response to
the Commissioner’s enquiries, Birthlink estimated that the Linked
Records may have included personal data of approximately 4,800
individuals.27

36. In the absence of any record relating to the Relevant Processing,
Birthlink estimated the number of files destroyed based on the following
assumptions:
a. 24 drawers of filing cabinets containing Linked Records were
destroyed; and
b. each drawer contained approximately 200 records.28
37. The estimated number provided by Birthlink only represents the
identifiable individuals to which the Linked Records relate. In practice,
each Linked Record will have contained personal data relating to other
‘linked’ individuals, the number of which was described to the
Commissioner as “incalculable”.29
38. In its written representations, Birthlink told the Commissioner that:
“Due to historic record keeping practices, regrettably it is not possible to
absolutely know how many people have been impacted or indeed who
those people are. Birthlink are deeply sorry that this is the situation”. 30
Impact on affected individuals
39. In its notification to the Commissioner, Birthlink highlighted the serious
nature of the Relevant Processing for its service users, as follows:
“Amongst the documents shredded were irreplaceable handwritten
letters from parents to their children who were adopted away from

them. Photographs of babies were destroyed. The significance of
these documents cannot be underestimated. People will no longer
have access to them.
40. The Care Inspectorate Report assessed the risk to Birthlink's service
users as "high" noting that their "sense of identity and history will be
severely compromised by \[theJ loss of historical information". 32
41. The Care Inspectorate's assessment is echoed by the findings of
Birthlink's internal investigation, which summarised the risks to affected
individuals in the following way:
"There is a high, and inevitable risk that service users' sense of
identity and understanding of their family history will be
compromised.
\_"\_33
42. In its written representations, Birthlink confirmed that its initial
understanding of the likely number of Linked Records containing
cherished or irreplaceable items (that is Linked Records containing the
only available source of that personal data) was not accurate:

“On reflection, our initial representation of the breach to the
Commissioner was based on organisational memory of the event and our
understanding of what a cherished item was. Recent consideration to
content of records through file sampling has brought to light that the
criteria of cherished (irreplaceable) items is not aligned with the archive
communities understanding of what constitutes a cherished item. The
onboarding of
to the organisation has allowed us to reappraise with their
subject matter expertise what truly constitutes a cherished item or
memory. Items considered as cherished include:
• Handwritten letters from birth Mothers and Fathers to their
children
• Handwritten letters from birth families to their sibling
• Photographs
•Information disclosed during the research period that are not
documented elsewhere”34
43. Birthlink submitted in its written and oral representations that file
sampling has identified evidence of these cherished items being given to
individuals when a link was made. Birthlink now estimates that the total
number of Linked Records containing cherished items that could not be
replaced may “be less than 10%”.35
44. On 19 March 2025, Birthlink provided a report to the Commissioner
entitled “Experiences and impacts of historic forced adoption- a trauma
lens”. This opening paragraph of this report summarises Birthlink’s
current understanding of the impact on affected individuals as follows:
34 Birthlink written representations dated 25 February 2025
35 Birthlink written representations dated 25 February 2025

“On 15 April 2021 a large quantity of files was destroyed. For a small
(unknown) number of people this included irreplaceable items. This was
not a trauma informed decision. The agency has not kept these items
reliably and has significantly disempowered the people served. Included
in the destruction were photographs and letters from parents to their
adopted children.”
Communicating with affected individuals
45. In its Personal Data Breach Report, Birthlink told the Commissioner that
it had contacted the individuals affected.36
46. In response to the Commissioner’s enquiries, Birthlink clarified its
position noting that only individuals returning to Birthlink for another
service and identified as being affected by the breach had been notified.
Birthlink confirmed that without a record of the Linked Records that had
been destroyed, it was not able to communicate the breach to the
remaining affected individuals.37 Birthlink is reliant on individuals
searching for information on a Linked Record before it is able to
determine whether the individual has been affected by the Relevant
Processing. Where that is the case, Birthlink has informed the
Commissioner that it is employing a duty of candour protocol to explain
to service users that the Linked Record cannot be located.
47. The Commissioner acknowledges that Birthlink did consider whether it
would be appropriate to make a public communication regarding the
Relevant Processing.

48. Birthlink was asked to provide further representations on the appropriate
ways it could have communicated the personal data breach to affected
data subjects. In its representations, Birthlink identified three potential
approaches and provided representations on the impact and outcome of
these approaches, namely:
a. Communicating with all people recorded in the Adoption Contact
Register (Approximately 32,000 people);
b. Communicating to the general public using prominent website
banners or notifications or prominent advertisements in print
media;
C. Communicating on an individual tailored approach to people who
have historically been supported by Birthlink and return for further
services.38
49. In its written representations Birthlink outlined the ethical and practical
difficulties of communicating with all people recorded in the Adoption
Contact Register.
50. Birthlink told the Commissioner that it had not communicated the data
breach to the general public as, amongst other reasons, it did not want
“people to think they had cherished and irreplaceable items on file when
this was not the case,
”.39
51. Birthlink had therefore elected for an individual tailored approach,
communicating the data breach to people who have historically been
supported by Birthlink and they return for further services.40 Birthlink

believes that this has allowed a “trauma sensitive and person-centred
approach”.41
IV. THE COMMISSIONER’S FINDINGS OF INFRINGEMENT
A. Controllership and jurisdiction
52. Recital 15 UK GDPR provides that the “protection of natural persons
should apply to… manual processing, if the personal data are contained
or are intended to be contained in a filing system”.
53. The Linked Records were stored in filing cabinets and were, for the
proper operation of the services offered by Birthlink, able to be retrieved
according to specific criteria. The Linked Records therefore formed part
of a ‘filing system’ as defined by Article 4(6) UK GDPR.
54. Based on the nature of the Linked Records, the purposes for which they
were held, and the categories of documents they were likely to contain,
the Commissioner is satisfied that the Linked Records contained personal
data within the meaning of Article 4(1) UK GDPR.
55. Birthlink is the controller in respect of its processing of personal data
contained within the Linked Records. It determines the purposes and
means by which that personal data is processed within the meaning of
Article 4(7) UK GDPR.
56. The Relevant Processing (i.e. the destruction) of the Linked Records was
an act of processing the personal data contained within those records
within the meaning of Article 4(2) UK GDPR.
41 Birthlink written representations dated 25 February 2025
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
19
57. The UK GDPR applied to the Relevant Processing by virtue of Article 2(1)
(as supplemented by Article 2(5)(a)(ii)) UK GDPR and Article 3(1) UK
GDPR. That is:
a. the Relevant Processing was structured processing of personal
data forming, or intended to form, part of a filing system;
b. it took place in the context of the activities of a controller
established in the UK; and
c. none of the exceptions in Article 2 UK GDPR apply.
58. Part 2 of the DPA applied to the Relevant Processing by virtue of section
4 DPA.
B. Nature of the personal data and context of the processing
59. The Linked Records formed part of Birthlink’s maintenance of the
Adoption Contact Register for Scotland and its provision of specialist
post-adoption support.
60. Birthlink addressed the nature of the Linked Records in its written
representations. The February 2025 Risk Assessment, records that:
“The destroyed records were classed as ‘linked’ files. What this means
in practice is that a link with a family member has been made on the
adoption contact register (ACR). The person searching for their family
member will have been informed that a match has been made on the
ACR and supported to make decisions about what to do next. The
person then has it within their power to decide whether to connect with
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
20
their family member or not. The person will have received copies of
their information.”
61. At the oral representations meeting, Birthlink’s provided further
representations on the role of the “linked records” which were
destroyed. The minutes of the meeting record that:
“the destroyed files were all likely to be ‘linked’ files because of the
way they were stored. In this case a match will have been made
through the Adoption Contact Register (ACR) and the individuals will
have been communicating with each other. Those files were then
closed and would only have been reopened again if the person came
back to Birthlink wanting to find another family member.” 42
62. The Commissioner accepts the representations from Birthlink that the
Linked Records are likely to have been records where a link had been
made through the Adoption Contact Register.
63. Whilst some of the documents contained in the Linked Records will have
been given to the individual when a link was made and some will be
replaceable from public records (e.g. birth certificates), other documents
containing personal data (including the personal data contained in
cherished or irreplaceable items) are likely to have been destroyed.

65. Birthlink told the Commissioner that, in some cases, the Linked Records
“will have contained the only reference anywhere in the world to the
paternity of adopted children”.45
66. Whilst Birthlink now estimates that the total number of Linked Records
containing irreplaceable items may “be less than 10%”46 the weight
which can be placed on this figure is limited. Birthlink does not know the
exact nature of the Linked Records destroyed so cannot say with
certainty that the files sampled by are comparable to those
which were destroyed.
67. The Commissioner is satisfied that some of the Linked Records will have
contained irreplaceable items (e.g. handwritten letters from birth
parents and birth families, photographs and other sensitive personal
information).
68. However, as Birthlink did not document the Linked Records which were
destroyed it is therefore not possible to definitively determine which
Linked Records (including the documents and personal data contained
within them) were lost due to the Relevant Processing.
C. The infringements | Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1)-(2) UK GDPR
69. The Commissioner has considered whether the facts set out in
paragraphs 20 to 34 above constitute infringements of Articles 5(1)(f)
and 32(1)-(2) UK GDPR. The relevant text of those provisions is
reproduced in Annex 2 to this Penalty Notice.

70. In order to assess Birthlink’s compliance with Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1)-
(2) UK GDPR, the Commissioner must necessarily exercise his
judgement, as the regulator, as to what “appropriate” security and
“appropriate” organisational measures would be in the circumstances
(that is, taking into account “the state of the art, the costs of
implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of
processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the
rights and freedoms of natural persons”).
71. For the reasons set out below, the Commissioner’s view is that Birthlink
infringed Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1)-(2) UK GDPR. The infringements
involved Birthlink’s failure to use appropriate organisational measures to
ensure the appropriate security of the personal data from the Relevant
Processing.
Appropriate security of the personal data
72. In assessing the “appropriate security of the personal data” under Article
5(1)(f) UK GDPR (and, equivalently, the “level of security appropriate to
the risk” under Article 32 UK GDPR), the Commissioner has considered
the risk to the rights and freedoms of Birthlink’s service users which the
Relevant Processing presented. Recital 75 UK GDPR states that such risk
“may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical,
material or non-material damage”.
73. As explained at paragraphs 39 and 41 above, Birthlink informed the
Commissioner that the destruction of the Linked Records presents a high
and inevitable risk to affected service users. Those risks include:
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION

ICO.Information Commissioner's Office
74. The Commissioner considers all three categories of damage as identified
in Recital 75 UK GDPR (physical, material and non-material) would be
likely to flow from the risks identified at paragraph 73 above.
75. The Commissioner acknowledges that neither he nor Birthlink have
received any complaints in relation to the Relevant Processing. However,
little weight can be placed on the absence of complaints in circumstances
where Birthlink has not been able to communicate the personal data
breach to affected individuals and has not communicated the personal
data breach more widely. Publicly communicating the personal data

breach would have enabled service users to come forward and enquire
whether their personal data had been affected.51
76. Based on the risks identified at paragraphs 39 to 41 and 73 above, the
Commissioner considers the severity of the risks associated with the
Relevant Processing to be high.
77. In respect of the likelihood of risk, Birthlink should have been aware that
any unauthorised access to, loss or destruction of, the Linked Records,
was likely to pose a significant risk to rights and freedoms of its service
users.
78. The factors identified above indicate that a high level of security was
appropriate to the risk presented by the general processing of Linked
Records (e.g. storage and retention) and, in particular, the Relevant
Processing. Birthlink was therefore required to implement appropriate
organisational measures to ensure a high level of security.
Assessment of compliance
79. Under the UK GDPR, it is for Birthlink to demonstrate compliance with
Article 5(1)(f) (by virtue of Article 5(2)). It is also for Birthlink to
demonstrate compliance with Article 32(1) and (2) UK GDPR (by virtue
of Article 24).
80. The Commissioner finds that the Linked Records destroyed by the
Relevant Processing were not processed in a manner that ensured the
51 Birthlink written representations 25 February 2025 record that Birthlink recognises that publicly communicating
the breach could “offer opportunities for duty of candour to be undertaken” although this would need to be balanced
against the risks that people may think they had cherished and irreplaceable items on file destroyed when this was
not the case, discussed below at paragraphs 154-158. 154

appropriate security of the personal data (including protection against
unauthorised destruction).
81. The Commissioner’s Security Guidance52 explains:
“Every aspect of your processing of personal data is covered, not
just cybersecurity. This means the security measures you put in
place should seek to ensure that:
• the data can be accessed, altered, disclosed or deleted only by
those you have authorised to do so (and that those people only
act within the scope of the authority you give them);
…
• the data remains accessible and usable, ie, if personal data is
accidentally lost, altered or destroyed, you should be able to
recover it and therefore prevent any damage or distress to the
individuals concerned”.
82. Since, at least, 25 May 2018 (the date on which the DPA and the UK
GDPR53 came into force), Birthlink should have implemented appropriate
policies, procedures and training to demonstrate compliance with UK
GDPR. This was particularly important with regards to its processing of
Linked Records and the efficacy of the services it offers to its users. For
the reasons provided at paragraphs 73 to 77 above, Birthlink ought to
have been aware of the high risk of damage and distress likely to be

53 For the reasons set out at footnote 1 above, for the period 25 May 2018 to 31 December 2020, references in this
Notice to the UK GDPR should be read as references to the GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European

personal data and on the free movement of such data) as it applied in the UK during that period.

caused to its service users if Linked Records were destroyed without
authorisation or were otherwise lost.
83. From, at least, 25 May 2018 until remedial action was taken by Birthlink
(starting in March 2023 and then following the Care Inspectorate Report
dated 5 September 2023), Birthlink failed to implement:
a. A data retention policy 54
b. A data destruction policy
c. Any sufficient internal approval process for the destruction of
Linked Records
d. Any data protection training for members of staff55
84. These organisational measures could have been implemented at minimal
cost and would have, in all likelihood, prevented the unauthorised
destruction of Linked Records.
85. Furthermore, Birthlink has not provided the Commissioner with any
evidence demonstrating it had assessed the risk posed to personal data
contained in the Linked Records or how valuable, sensitive or confidential
the personal data was for the purposes for which it was processed (as
required by Article 32(2) UK GDPR).
86. In the absence of any assessment of the risks posed to personal data
contained in Linked Records and the implementation of any
organisational measures to ensure the security of such personal data,
54 A data retention policy was first put in place in March 2023 (Birthlink written representations 25 February 2025)

the Commissioner finds Birthlink has infringed Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1) and
32(2) of the UK GDPR.
D. The infringements | Article 5(2) UK GDPR
87. The Commissioner has also considered whether Birthlink has infringed
Article 5(2) UK GDPR. The text of Article 5(2) is reproduced in Annex 2
to this Penalty Notice.
88. Article 5(2) UK GDPR imposes a dual requirement on controllers:
a. Firstly, to be responsible for compliance with the data protection
principles.
b. Secondly, to demonstrate compliance with those principles.
89. During the Commissioner’s investigation, Birthlink explained that it had
not implemented organisational measures (such as those set out in
paragraph 83 above) and that it had a limited understanding of the UK
GDPR. At the relevant time, Birthlink also:
a. failed to maintain a record of its processing activities (Article 30
UK GDPR);
b. did not undertake any data protection impact assessments for any
of its high-risk processing activities (Article 35 UK GDPR); and
c. did not have an appointed data protection officer (Article 37 UK
GDPR).
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
28
90. In the absence of basic organisational measures safeguarding personal
data contained within the Linked Records and any record of processing
activities, Birthlink has been unable to demonstrate its responsibility for
compliance with the data protection principles. In particular:
a. Article 5(1)(a) (‘lawfulness fairness and transparency’ principle)
b. Article 5(1)(e) (‘storage limitation’ principle)
c. Article 5(1)(f) (‘integrity and confidentiality’ principle)
91. The appointment of a data protection officer would have provided
Birthlink with a specialist resource. A data protection officer would have
recognised the importance of implementing appropriate policies and
procedures, conducting data protection impact assessments, and
implementing appropriate organisational measures. By not appointing
such a resource Birthlink’s decision to undertake the Relevant Processing
was left to managers without any formal data protection training and/or
guidance and led to the destruction of private and sensitive personal
data.
92. Whilst Birthlink has now appointed a data protection officer and has
made meaningful progress in implementing important measures to bring
its data protection into compliance, in April 2021 it is accepted that the
Relevant Processing was “not well governed, controlled or
documented”.56
Demonstrating compliance with Article 5(1)(a) UK GDPR
93. The lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle requires compliance
with three further provisions of the UK GDPR:
56 Birthlink representations, February 2025 Risk Assessment
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
29
a. Article 6 (‘lawfulness of processing’)
b. Article 9 (‘processing of special category of data’)
c. Article 12 (‘transparent information, communication and means
of data subjects exercising their rights’)
94. Birthlink has not been able to demonstrate a lawful basis for the Relevant
Processing under Articles 6 and 9 UK GDPR (as appropriate). This is
compounded by Birthlink’s failure to maintain a record of its processing
activities in accordance with Article 30 UK GDPR. A record of processing
activities would have assisted Birthlink to take responsibility for retention
and destruction of Linked Records and demonstrate a lawful basis for the
Relevant Processing.
95. Furthermore, Birthlink provided the Commissioner with a copy of its
privacy notice dated November 2020 during his investigation. It referred
to the storage of personal data but did not provide any information on
the length of time the personal data would be retained or that it would
be destroyed after a specified period.
96. By not having a privacy notice informing people how long their personal
data would be retained for and how it would be destroyed when it was
no longer necessary, Birthlink did not demonstrate compliance with the
transparency requirements of Article 5(1)(a).
Demonstrating compliance with Article 5(1)(e) UK GDPR
97. Demonstrating compliance with Article 5(1)(e) UK GDPR required
Birthlink to implement appropriate policies and procedures relating to
the retention of Linked Records and the destruction of such records.
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
30
98. Without a data retention policy, Birthlink was not able to demonstrate
personal data was no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was
obtained (and could therefore be destroyed in accordance with a data
destruction policy).
99. A data retention policy would have assisted Birthlink in identifying the
personal data which had been destroyed. This would, in turn, have
supported appropriate communication with data subjects and with the
Commissioner. This failure has had significant consequences for both
Birthlink and data subjects and underscores the critical importance of
data protection compliance and accountability.
Demonstrating compliance with Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR
100. Similarly, in the absence of appropriate policies, procedures and staff
training, Birthlink was not able to demonstrate compliance with its
obligations under Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR or how it was taking
responsibility for such compliance. Birthlink’s failure to comply with
Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR is considered at paragraphs 69 to 86 above.
E. The infringements | Article 33 UK GDPR
101. The text of Article 33(1) UK GDPR is reproduced in Annex 2 to this
Penalty Notice.
102. By Article 33(1) UK GDPR controllers must notify the Commissioner
within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach unless it is
unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
The Commissioner considers that the Relevant Processing constituted a
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
31
notifiable personal data breach and Birthlink was under an obligation to
notify the Commissioner.
103. In its representations, Birthlink told the Commissioner that “people did
not identify it as a data breach at the time and did not see it necessary
to report”.57
104. This is not an adequate justification for the failure to notify the
Commissioner. The UK GDPR puts an obligation on data controllers to
have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to
quickly detect if a data breach has occurred. Birthlink cannot rely on its
failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures
as a justification for not identifying and reporting a personal data
breach.58
105. A personal data breach is defined by Article 4(12) UK GDPR and includes
“a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction
\[or\] loss… of personal data”.
106. Service users provided their personal data to Birthlink in the expectation
that their data would be held securely. This is particularly so in
circumstances where Birthlink was entrusted with documents which
contained highly sensitive and sentimental personal data. On that basis,
it ought to have been clear to Birthlink that the destruction of the Linked
Records constituted a personal data breach that was required to be
notified to the Commissioner.
57 Birthlink written representations 25 February 2025
58 The WP29 Guidelines on Personal Data Breach Notification (Guidelines 9/2022) explains that the GDPR “…requires
the controller to implement all appropriate technical protection and organizational measures to establish
immediately whether a breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data
subjects….. This puts an obligation on the controller to ensure that they will be ‘aware’ of any breaches in a timely
manner so that they can take appropriate action.” 58 WP29 has been replaced by the European Data Protection
Board (EDPB). Although these guidelines relate to the EU version of the GDPR, they are a useful resource for
understanding the requirements of the UK GDPR.
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION

107. Birthlink initially told the Commissioner that the risk to affected
individuals is high59. Birthlink therefore ought to have recognised that
the Article 33(1) UK GDPR threshold for making such a notification had
been met.
108. As part of its written representations, Birthlink submitted the February
2025 Risk Assessment. In this risk assessment, the likelihood of harm
was assessed as “medium”. Birthlink explained that the likelihood of
harm in the risk matrix submitted was assessed on the basis that “no
individuals have come back to Birthlink in 4 years and subsequently been
identified as having cherished items missing”. The Commissioner does
not accept that this is a proper assessment of the likelihood of the risks
to data subjects and is not a sufficient risk assessment for the purposes
of Article 33 UK GDPR. In assessing risk in accordance with the
requirements of Article 33 UK GDPR, a controller must have regard
objectively both to the likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights
and freedoms of data subjects. An assessment with the benefit of
hindsight based on the small number of data subjects informed60 by
Birthlink that files had been destroyed is not an objective assessment of
the potential adverse consequences for individuals from the destruction
of the Linked Records.
109. It was Birthlink’s responsibility to assess the Relevant Processing and
determine whether it met the threshold for notification to the
Commissioner as required by Article 33(1) UK GDPR. It failed to do so.

110. Birthlink did not notify the Commissioner within 72 hours of becoming
aware of the personal data breach (i.e. when the personal data contained
in the destroyed Linked Records was no longer accessible). The personal
data breach was only reported to the Commissioner two years and five
months later following the publication of a report by the Care
Inspectorate (see paragraphs 30 to 32).
111. The Commissioner therefore finds Birthlink infringed Article 33(1) UK
GDPR.
V. DECISION TO IMPOSE A PENALTY
A. Legal Framework | Penalties
112. When deciding whether to issue a penalty notice, and determining the
appropriate amount of that penalty, section 155(2)(a) DPA requires the
Commissioner to have regard to the matters listed in Articles 83(1) and
83(2) UK GDPR, insofar as they are relevant in the circumstances of the
case.
113. Article 83(1) UK GDPR requires any penalty imposed by the
Commissioner to be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in each
individual case.
114. Article 83(2) UK GDPR requires the Commissioner to have due regard to
the following factors when determining whether to issue a penalty notice
and the appropriate amount of any such penalty in each individual case:
“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement taking
into account the nature scope or purpose of the processing
concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected and the
level of damage suffered by them;
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
34
(b) the intentional or negligent character of the infringement;
(c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the
damage suffered by data subjects;
(d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor
taking into account technical and organisational measures
implemented by them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;
(e) any relevant previous infringements by the controller or
processor;
(f) the degree of cooperation with the Commissioner, in order to
remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects
of the infringement;
(g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
(h) the manner in which the infringement became known to the
Commissioner, in particular whether, and if so to what extent, the
controller or processor notified the infringement;
(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously
been ordered against the controller or processor concerned with
regard to the same subject-matter, compliance with those
measures;
(j) adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40
or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42; and
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the
circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained, or
losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement”.

B. The Commissioner’s Decision on whether to Impose a
Penalty
115. Paragraphs 117 to 174 below set out the Commissioner’s assessment of
whether it is appropriate to issue a penalty in relation to the five
infringements set out above. That assessment involves consideration of
the factors in Articles 83(1) and 83(2) UK GDPR. The order in which
these considerations are set out below follows the Commissioner’s Data
Protection Fining Guidance (“Fining Guidance”):61
a. Seriousness of the infringements (Article 83(2)(a), (b) and
(g))
b. Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors (Article 83(2)(c)-
(f), (h)-(k))
c. Effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness (Article
83(1))
116. The Commissioner has not conducted a separate assessment for each of
the infringements. He considers the infringements of Articles 5(1)(f),
5(2), 32(1) and 32(2) relate to the same processing operations. Whilst
the failure to report the personal data breach under Article 33 is a
separate infringement, in the circumstances of this case, the
Commissioner considers that failure to be linked to the lack of
appropriate technical and organisational measures and the failure to
demonstrate compliance with the data protection principles.62 An
61 Dated 15 March 2024 (available at: https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/our-information/policies-and-
procedures/data-protection-fining-guidance/) \[last accessed: 10 June 2025\]
62 For the avoidance of doubt, the Commissioner considers Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 32(1), 32(2) and 33 UK GDPR to be
evidently distinct provisions of the UK GDPR. Had the Commissioner calculated penalties for infringements of these
provisions separately, he would have had to ensure, in accordance with Article 83(3) UK GDPR, that the total penalty
did not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement (that of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR). However, in this
Notice the Commissioner has exercised his discretion and decided to calculate a single penalty.
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION

36
assessment of whether it is appropriate to issue a penalty has therefore
been taken in relation to the infringements collectively.
Seriousness of infringements | Article 83(2)(a) the nature, gravity and
duration of the infringements
117. In assessing the seriousness of the infringements, the Commissioner has
given due regard to their nature, gravity and duration.
Nature of the infringements
118. Article 5(1)(f) and 5(2) UK GDPR are core principles of processing
personal data. Infringements of these principles are subject to the higher
maximum fine63 reflecting the seriousness of such infringements.
119. Infringements of Articles 32(1), 32(2) and 33(1) UK GDPR are subject
to the standard maximum fine.64
120. The nature of the personal data and the context of the Relevant
Processing is set out at paragraphs 59 to 68 above. In the
Commissioner’s view, the absence of appropriate organisational
measures to ensure an appropriate level of security presented a high risk
to underlying individuals. The risk materialised on 15 April 2021.
121. The Commissioner has identified infringements of four provisions of the
UK GDPR which led to the unauthorised destruction of personal data (see
63 £17,500,000, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding
financial year, whichever is higher (Article 83(5) UK GDPR).

paragraphs 69 to 111 above). Birthlink accepts that there was limited
understanding of the UK GDPR at the time of the Relevant Processing.65
122. The infringement of Article 33(1) UK GDPR not only relates to Birthlink’s
failure to notify the Commissioner of the personal data breach within 72
hours of becoming aware of it, it represents a failure to implement
appropriate measures to establish whether a personal data breach had
actually occurred.66 Birthlink accepts that its staff had not undergone
any formal data protection training prior to March 2023 at which time
such training was introduced.67 This illustrates the interconnection
between Birthlink’s infringement of Article 33(1) UK GDPR and its
accountability failings under Article 5(2) UK GDPR.
123. Birthlink’s limited understanding of core principles of data protection law
increases the seriousness of the infringements.
Gravity of the infringements
124. In assessing the gravity of the infringements, the Commissioner has
considered the nature, scope and purpose of the Relevant Processing, as
well as the number of data subjects affected by the Relevant Processing
and the level of damage they have suffered.68
125. The Commissioner notes that Article 83 UK GDPR has a punitive purpose
and is not conditional on evidence of actual harm to data subjects.69

courts. However, domestic courts may still have regard to decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union
insofar as such decisions are relevant to matters before them.

126. Nature and purpose of processing | The nature and purpose of
Birthlink’s processing of the personal data contained in Linked Records
is explained at paragraphs 59 to 68 of this Penalty Notice. The
Commissioner acknowledges that the processing activities should be
viewed in the context of Birthlink furthering its charitable purposes but
nevertheless finds:
i. Service users provided personal data (some highly sensitive
and sentimental) to Birthlink in the expectation that their
data would be held securely for the purpose of establishing
a link between birth and adoptive relatives. In some cases,
birth parents entrusted Birthlink with irreplaceable
handwritten letters and photographs intended for their
children that had been placed for adoption.70
ii. The personal value of the services offered by Birthlink was
high. In its report, the Care Inspectorate highlighted the
nature and quality of the support which Birthlink provided to
its users with one user commenting that “my life has been
transformed significantly by Birthlink”.71
iii. In the absence of appropriate security measures, and in the
event of a personal data breach, the nature of Birthlink’s
processing was likely to result in a high risk to data subjects.
Paragraph 73 above contains a summary of the complex
impact the Relevant Processing may have on affected
individuals.

NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION

39
iv. The highly sensitive and sentimental nature of some of the
personal data likely to have been destroyed by the Relevant
Processing adds to the seriousness.
127. Scope of processing | In regard to the scope of Birthlink’s processing
activities, the Commissioner notes that:
i. The territorial scope of the processing is broad. Birthlink’s
processing of personal data within Linked Records is for the
purpose of maintaining the Adoption Contact Register and
providing services to partner organisations. The Adoption
Contact Register was established in 1984 and relates to
adoption cases with a Scottish connection.
ii. Birthlink did not maintain records of the Relevant Processing
but estimates that the Relevant Processing is likely to have
affected 4,800 Linked Records. However, Birthlink has told
the Commissioner that the number of affected data subjects
is “incalculable”.
iii. The failure to maintain a record of the Relevant Processing
and to determine the identities of the affected data subjects
(particularly in circumstances where there is a high
likelihood of complex harm arising) increases the
seriousness.
Duration of the infringements
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
40
128. Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2) and 32(1)-(2) UK GDPR | The Commissioner
finds that the duration of the infringements was from, at least, 25 May
2018 (the date on which the DPA and the GDPR (now UK GDPR) came
into force) until remedial action was taken by Birthlink following the Care
Inspectorate Report dated 5 September 202372.
129. Article 33 UK GDPR | The Commissioner finds that the infringement
was from 18 April 2021 (i.e. 72 hours after the Relevant Processing) until
8 September 2023 (i.e. the date on which Birthlink notified the
Commissioner of the personal data breach). A delay of two years and
five months represents a marked departure from the obligation to notify
the Commissioner within 72 hours in accordance with Article 33(1) UK
GDPR.
Conclusion on nature, gravity and duration of the infringements
130. The nature, gravity and duration of the infringements all increase the
seriousness of the infringements.
Seriousness of infringements | Article 83(2)(b) the intentional or
negligent character of the infringements
131. In its notification to the Commissioner, Birthlink highlighted it was an
“intentional decision at the time to destroy records”.73 The
Commissioner, however, finds the infringements not to have been
intentional.
72 Although data protection training and retention policies were implemented in March 2023, the infringements
continued until appropriate technical and organisational measures were implemented following the Care
Inspectorate Report dated 05 September 2023.

132. In reaching this finding, the Commissioner has viewed the infringements
in the context of Birthlink’s failure to demonstrate compliance with data
protection principles and its admission that it had a limited
understanding of data protection law at the relevant time.
133. Whilst the may have intended to destroy the Linked
Records, the Commissioner considers that, in doing so, they did not
intend to contravene data protection law. At paragraphs 20 to 22 above,
it is noted that did give consideration to barriers that may
prevent the destruction of the Linked Records (although no
contemporaneous detail of those considerations is available).
134. The Commissioner has considered the personal accounts from the
members of staff involved but has placed limited weight on them given
the two year and five month delay in obtaining those accounts.
135. In the circumstances, had Birthlink provided data protection training for
its staff and implemented appropriate policies and procedures for staff
to follow, the managers would have had a greater awareness of what
they could and could not do with the Linked Records.
136. The implementation of appropriate policies and procedures would also
have enabled Birthlink’s staff to recognise that the Relevant Processing
was a personal data breach and that it had an obligation to make a
notification to the Commissioner.
137. The Commissioner is therefore satisfied that the Relevant Processing was
negligent, not intentional.

138. In its notification to the Commissioner, Birthlink identified that the
categories of personal data affected by the Relevant Processing
comprised special category data, and included data relating to criminal
convictions and/or offences and genetic or biometric data.74
139. Birthlink also informed the Commissioner that the Linked Records may
have contained handwritten letters from birth parents and birth families,
photographs and other sensitive personal information.75 Paragraph 72 of
the Fining Guidance provides that the Commissioner may also consider
private communications as being particularly sensitive (this is especially
so when such communications contain intimate details or confidential
information about an individual).
140. The Commissioner is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to
conclude that it is likely that highly sensitive personal data (including
special category data) contained on some of the Linked Files was
destroyed by the Relevant Processing. Some of the destroyed personal
data is irreplaceable and its destruction is likely to have a detrimental
impact on the affected data subjects. Examples of the impact likely to
be caused to affected individuals is described at paragraphs 39 and 41
to 73 above.
141. As a consequence of the failure on the part of Birthlink to have in place
appropriate data protection policies and procedures, including records of
processing and retention and destruction policies, Birthlink has been
74 Although the February 2025 Risk Assessment did not recognise the inclusion of data relating to criminal
convictions/offences and genetic or biometric data, this was clarified at the Oral Representations Meeting. The
sample files reviewed did not contain these categories of personal data. This is not sufficient to establish on the
balance of probabilities that the Linked Files did not contain these categories of personal data or for the
Commissioner to disregard the information contained in the Breach Report submitted by Birthlink dated 8
September 2023.

unable to identify how many data subjects have been impacted or which
data subjects are likely to have had irreplaceable items destroyed. This
increases the seriousness of the infringements.
Conclusion on seriousness of infringements
142. Having considered the nature, gravity and duration of the infringements,
as well as their negligent character and the categories of personal data
affected, the Commissioner categorises the infringements as having a
high degree of seriousness.
143. In the absence of any mitigating factors, the infringements would
warrant a monetary penalty.
Aggravating and mitigating factors
144. In determining the seriousness of Birthlink’s infringements, the
Commissioner must also consider whether any other factors aggravate
or mitigate the position. The Commissioner has had regard to all the
factors contained in Article 83(2) UK GDPR and addresses the provisions
he considers are relevant in this case below.
Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors | Article 83(2)(c) any
action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage
suffered by the data subjects
145. Birthlink told the Commissioner that it has no records of any measures
taken to mitigate the detriment to data subjects immediately following
the Relevant Processing.76
76 Email from Birthlink to ICO dated 15 November 2023
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
44
146. Furthermore, it was only once the Care Inspectorate brought the
personal data breach to the attention of the Interim Chief Executive
Officer in September 2023 that Birthlink took any steps to review the
impact of the Relevant Processing and improve its data protection
compliance posture. These steps included:
i. Completing an internal investigation and coming up with
eight learning points and 14 recommendations. Birthlink has
informed the Commissioner that the recommendations have
since been implemented;
ii. Implementing a data retention and data destruction policy;
iii. Creating and maintaining a record of Birthlink’s data
processing activities;
iv. Conducting data protection impact assessments in relation
to its processing activities;
v. Introducing mandatory data protection training for its staff
(all staff had undertaken the training by 24 November
2023).
147. In its written representations, Birthlink gave the Commissioner further
information on improvements to data protection and information
governance which have been implemented. All incoming casework is now
recorded digitally. Birthlink explained that:
“The digitisation of the physical records began in June 2023 and is being
undertaken concurrently with an audit of the Adoption Contact Register.
This means that physical records are systematically being examined, and

Official-Sensitive

the physical record is being digitised and held electronically in the
information management system. Quality assurance is built into the
process to ensure that the data is reliably recorded". 77
148. With regard to cherished or irreplaceable items, Birthlink told the
Commissioner that there is now a box on the information management
system to indicate there is a cherished item for the person and that
cherished items are placed in archival preservation envelopes and filed
in a fireproof, waterproof box. 78
149. However, the Commissioner notes that the above steps were taken a
significant period of time after the Relevant Processing occurred and are,
in any event, unlikely to mitigate any damage caused to affected
individuals.
150. Furthermore, the steps taken by Birthlink, after being notified of the
personal data breach by the Care Inspectorate, are considered to be
actions expected of any data controller in response to an incident of this
nature.
151. The Commissioner has therefore been provided with no evidence that
any steps have been taken to mitigate the potential impact of the
personal data breach on data subjects.
152. Birthlink told the Commissioner that the risk to affected individuals is
high. It recognises it is inevitable that those affected individuals' -

153. Despite the high risk to the rights and freedoms of affected individuals
recognised by Birthlink in September 2023, Birthlink has not
communicated the personal data breach to affected individuals. Birthlink
told the Commissioner that it has no record of what was destroyed and
is reliant on individuals searching for information known to have been
held on a Linked Record before it can determine if they have been
affected.
154. Birthlink told the Commissioner that it conducted a risk assessment on
whether to issue a public statement concerning the personal data
breach. In deciding against issuing such a statement, Birthlink cited that
it did not wish to cause unnecessary harm to its service users in leading
them to believe that something significant had been destroyed when that
may not have been the case.
155. The Commissioner considered whether it would be appropriate to make
a finding of infringement of Article 34 UK GDPR80 and to include
consideration of this infringement in the decision to impose a penalty.
The Commissioner decides that this would not be an appropriate or
proportionate use of his powers. Birthlink has given some consideration
to notifying data subjects and the Commissioner recognises the nuanced
decision making required, in light of the concerns in respect of the
wellbeing of data subjects.

of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay
46
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
47
156. The Commissioner next considered whether the failure on the part of
Birthlink to notify impacted data subjects of the personal data breach
and to take any steps to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects,
constitutes an aggravating factor.
157. In his provisional decision, the Commissioner was minded to conclude
that this failure was an aggravating factor. However, in response to the
notice of intent. Birthlink provided the Commissioner with detailed and
considered representations on how it had assessed the appropriate ways
it could have communicated the data breach to affected data subjects.81
158. After carefully considering these representations and noting the detail
provided by Birthlink regarding the positive and negative impact of
communicating the personal data breach to affected data subjects the
Commissioner is no longer satisfied that this should be considered to be
an aggravating factor. Whilst the Commissioner does not agree with the
approach taken by Birthlink, he is satisfied that it was not motivated by
attempts to avoid the financial implications of notifying data subjects.
The main concern for Birthlink was the impact and outcomes for data
subjects because it was not possible to identify how many data subjects
were impacted or to identify who those data subjects were.
Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors | Article 83(2)(d) the
degree of responsibility of the controller or processor
159. The Commissioner expects controllers processing personal data,
regardless of their size or financial position (i.e. the resources available
to it) to implement appropriate security measures and bear responsibility
for, and demonstrate compliance with, the accountability principle.
81 Birthlink written representations 25 February 2025

Official-Sensitive
48
160. Birthlink was the sole controller in respect of the processing and was
solely responsible for its own lack of awareness of, and compliance with,
core principles of processing personal data. However, this factor has
already been taken into account for the purposes of assessing Birthlink’s
substantive infringement of Article 5(2) UK GDPR.
Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors | Article 83(2)(f) the
degree of cooperation with the Commissioner
161. The Commissioner acknowledges that Birthlink has co-operated with the
investigation into the Relevant Processing. However, in doing so,
Birthlink has not gone above and beyond the normal level of cooperation
expected in response to a regulatory investigation.
162. In the circumstances, Birthlink’s degree of cooperation is a neutral
factor, which neither aggravates nor mitigates the infringements.
Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors | Article 83(2)(h) the
manner in which the infringements became known to the
Commissioner
163. Birthlink made a notification to the Commissioner in September 2023
(two years and five months after the Relevant Processing occurred).
Whilst the Commissioner considers this to be a marked departure from
the obligation on Birthlink to notify the Commissioner of a personal data
breach within 72 hours, it has already been taken into account for the
purposes of assessing Birthlink’s substantive infringement of Article
33(1) UK GDPR.
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
49
164. Accordingly, the delay in notifying the Commissioner is not treated as an
aggravating factor.
Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors | Article 83(2)(k) any other
applicable aggravating or mitigating factors
165. For completeness, the Commissioner has considered whether there are
any other relevant factors which operate to aggravate or mitigate the
infringements.
166. No further aggravating or mitigating factors have been identified.
Conclusion on relevant aggravating and mitigating factors
167. There are no aggravating or mitigating factors which impact on the
assessment of the seriousness of the infringements. The Commissioner
therefore considers that a penalty remains appropriate.
Effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness
168. The final stage involves a consideration of the effectiveness,
proportionality and dissuasiveness of a penalty. The Commissioner
considers the imposition of a penalty to be an effective, proportionate
and dissuasive measure.
169. Imposing a penalty on Birthlink would promote compliance with data
protection law and provide an appropriate sanction for the infringements.
170. A penalty will ensure Birthlink takes its data protection obligations
seriously and takes appropriate steps to prevent personal data breaches
in the future.
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
50
171. There is also a need to deter other organisations (including those in the
same sector) that hold sensitive personal data from acting in the same
way. The imposition of a penalty will also act as a deterrent to other
organisations which might otherwise choose not to notify the
Commissioner within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data
breach.
172. Whilst the Commissioner has taken into account Birthlink’s size and
charitable status, given the seriousness of the infringements the
Commissioner considers that the imposition of a penalty would
nevertheless be proportionate. The penalty would not exceed what is
considered to be appropriate and necessary in the circumstances to
ensure compliance with data protection legislation and to provide an
appropriate sanction for the infringements.
173. Birthlink submitted that in light of the financial pressures faced by
Birthlink, the Commissioner should consider a reprimand so that “the
equivalent money and more can be spent to benefit past, current and
future generations of service users”.82
174. The Commissioner has given careful consideration to this request and to
the question of whether a reprimand would be appropriate in all the
circumstances of this case. The Commissioner has had regard to the
Fining Guidance and also to his Regulatory Action Policy83. Whilst a
reprimand would allow the Commissioner to make a finding that Birthlink
has infringed data protection legislation, for the reasons set out above it
would not be an effective, proportionate or dissuasive response to the

serious findings of infringement set out at paragraphs 86, 100 and 111
above.
Conclusion on decision on whether to impose a penalty
175. In light of the assessment above, the Commissioner decides to impose
a penalty.
VI. Calculation of Penalty
176. The Fining Guidance sets out a five-step approach which the
Commissioner proposes to apply to calculate the amount of a penalty:
Step 1 Assessment of the seriousness of the infringement.
Step 2 Accounting for turnover (where the controller or
processor is part of an undertaking).
Step 3 Calculation of the starting point having regard to the
seriousness of the infringement and, where relevant, the
turnover of the undertaking.
Step 4 Adjustment to take into account any aggravating or
mitigating factors.
Step 5 Assessment of whether the fine is effective, proportionate
and dissuasive.
Following the application of this five-step approach, the Commissioner
has gone on to consider the amount of the penalty.
Statutory maximum penalty
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
52
177. Article 83(3) UK GDPR states that “if a controller or processor
intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations,
infringes several provisions of the UK GDPR, the total amount of the
administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest
infringement”.
178. The infringement of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR, which is a core principle for
processing, is subject to the higher maximum statutory penalty of £17.5
million or 4% of worldwide turnover, whichever is higher (Article
83(5)(a) UK GDPR). Had the Commissioner imposed a separate penalty
for each of the infringements, the total of those three penalties could not
have exceeded £17.5 million.
179. However, for the reasons given in paragraph 116 above, the
Commissioner has calculated a single penalty for all the infringements.
The calculation proceeds on the basis of a single statutory maximum of
£17.5 million.
A. Step 1 | Assessment of the seriousness of the infringement
180. As set out at paragraphs 109 to 115 of the Fining Guidance, the
Commissioner determines a starting point for the penalty first by
assessing the seriousness of the infringement. The Commissioner
categorises the infringement according to its degree of seriousness and
then chooses a starting point based on a percentage of the relevant
applicable statutory maximum.
181. In this Penalty Notice, the Commissioner has categorised the
infringements as having a high degree of seriousness. This means that
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
53
the starting point will be between 20% and 100% of the relevant legal
maximum (£17.5 million).
182. The Commissioner decides that the infringements warrant a starting
point of 70%.
183. A starting point of lower than 70% is not warranted due to the
seriousness of the infringements. The highly sensitive and sentimental
nature of some of the personal data, the absence of appropriate
organisational measures to ensure the appropriate level of security for
that data and the limited understanding of the core principles of data
protection law support a starting point of 70%.
184. A starting point of higher than 70% is not warranted as the infringements
were not intentional or committed for financial benefit and only some of
the Linked Records were likely to have contained cherished or
irreplaceable items.
B. Step 2 | Accounting for turnover
185. Having assessed the seriousness of the infringements, the Commissioner
next determines any adjustment to reflect the size of the recipient of the
penalty.84 This is consistent with the need to ensure the amount of the
penalty is effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
186. Where the recipient is an undertaking, the Commissioner will determine
the adjustment by reference to the undertaking’s turnover. As explained
at paragraph 119 of the Fining Guidance, where a recipient is not an
undertaking and therefore does not have turnover, the Commissioner
84 As set out at paragraph 128 of the Fining Guidance, any such adjustment is discretionary.
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
54
may instead have regard to other indicators of the recipient’s financial
position, such as assets, funding or administrative budget.
187. Taking into account Birthlink’s charitable status and the fact that the
Relevant Processing in this case related to the provision of the Adoption
Contact Register (which is not an economic activity), the Commissioner
has determined that it is likely that Birthlink falls outside the definition
of an undertaking. He has therefore adopted the more conservative
approach of using Birthlink’s support costs for the purpose of calculating
the amount of the fine, rather than using the (higher) amount reflecting
its total income (i.e. turnover). This is similar to the approach the
Commissioner typically takes in relation to public authorities, where he
has previously calculated the fine by reference to administrative budget.
188. In its Representations, Birthlink submitted that the provisional penalty
had “been calculated using the overall turnover rather than solely the
post adoption service budget”.85 This is not correct. As outlined above,
the Commissioner calculated the penalty using Birthlink’s support costs
rather than overall turnover.
189. Birthlink provided the Commissioner with its financial statements for the
year ended 31 March 2024.86 Birthlink’s support costs were £211,700
for the year ended 31 March 202487 and £211,316 for the year ended 31
March 2023.88
190. As set out in the Fining Guidance, in the case of a micro-enterprise with
an annual turnover of up to £2 million, the Commissioner may apply an
adjustment factor of between 0.2% and 0.4% to the starting point. In
85 Birthlink written representations 25 February 2025

NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
55
light of the support costs reported by Birthlink, the Commissioner
considers this range of adjustment to be appropriate for Birthlink’s case.
191. The Fining Guidance sets out that the Commissioner is likely to choose
a higher amount for undertakings with a higher turnover within the
applicable range, these ranges are however only indicative. The
Commissioner considers that in the circumstances of this case an
adjustment of 0.3% is appropriate to reflect Birthlink’s size and support
costs as well as the need for the fine to be effective, proportionate and
dissuasive.
C. Step 3 | Calculation of the starting point
192. The starting point of the penalty is calculated as follows:
Fixed statutory maximum (£17.5 million) x adjustment for seriousness
(70%) x turnover adjustment (0.3%) = £36,750 (thirty-six thousand
seven hundred and fifty pounds)
D. Step 4 | Adjustment to take into account any aggravating or
mitigating factors
193. The Commissioner next takes into account any aggravating or mitigating
factors. These factors may warrant an increase or decrease in the level
of the penalty calculated at the end of Step 3 (the starting point of
£36,750).
194. the Commissioner decides not to make any adjustment to take into
account the degree of responsibility of Birthlink. Any organisation
regardless of size and financial position (ie the resources available to it)
should be reasonably expected to implement appropriate security
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
56
measures to prevent the unauthorised destruction of records. However,
as this factor has been taken into account already by the Commissioner,
an increase in the level of the penalty is not warranted.
195. The Commissioner decides not to make any adjustment for aggravating
or mitigating factors.
196. The amount determined at Step 4 is £36,750 = £36,750 (thirty six
thousand, seven hundred and fifty pounds).
E. Step 5: Adjustment to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate
and dissuasive
197. As set out in the Fining Guidance “the aim of Steps 1 to 4 of the
calculation is to identify a fine amount that is effective, proportionate
and dissuasive. The purpose of Step 5 is to provide the opportunity for
the Commissioner to check that is the case”.
198. The Commissioner considers that a penalty of £36,750 will be effective,
proportionate and dissuasive. It is an appropriate sanction for the
infringements which have been found and is therefore effective.
199. A penalty in this amount will be dissuasive. It will have a genuine
deterrent effect, taking into account both the specific deterrent to
Birthlink and the general deterrence to other small organisations
providing this type of service
200. Taking into account Birthlink’s size and charitable status and the very
serious nature of the infringements, the penalty is proportionate.
NON-CONFIDENTIAL FOR PUBLICATION
Official-Sensitive
57
201. In making his decision and setting the amount of the penalty, the
Commissioner has also had regard to the desirability of promoting
economic growth (as required by section 108(1) of the Deregulation
Act 2015). In particular, the Commissioner has taken into
consideration:
a. the nature and level of risk associated with non-compliance with
data protection legislation (including risks to economic growth);
b. the steps taken by Birthlink to achieve compliance and the
reasons for its failure;
c. the willingness and ability of Birthlink to address its non-
compliance;
d. the likely impact of the proposed intervention on Birthlink and
the likely impact of the Commissioner’s regulatory intervention
(both in terms of deterrence and economic benefits to legitimate
businesses).
202. Having regard to the factors stated above, the Commissioner considers
that this Penalty Notice is unlikely to have an impact on any measure of
economic activity or growth in the United Kingdom, including levels of
employment and Gross Domestic Product.
F. Financial hardship
203. Paragraph 151 of the Fining Guidance outlines that, in exceptional
circumstances, the Commissioner may reduce a fine where an
organisation is unable to pay due to its financial position.

Official-Sensitive

204. In response to the notice of intent, Birthlink provided representations to
the Commissioner that:
a. A fine would impact mainly on people seeking services from Birthlink
and will delay organisation improvement, where financial investment
is critically needed;
b.
C.
d.
e. The funds held by Birthlink for other projects are restricted and
cannot be used to pay the penalty. 89
205. In addition to these points, in oral representations on financial hardship,
Birthlink submitted that:

penalty will have an impact on this investment.
206. As explained at paragraph 152 of the Fining Guidance, "The
Commissioner will only grant a reduction for financial hardship on the
basis of objective evidence that imposing the proposed fine would
irretrievably jeopardise an organisation's economic viability... The
Commissioner will not base any reduction on the mere finding of an
adverse ... financial situation."

207. The Commissioner finds that the representations from Birthlink go
beyond the confines of a mere adverse financial situation. Birthlink has
submitted with sufficient clarity details of the exceptional financial
challenges which Birthlink faces.
208. While the Commissioner has given careful consideration to the
representations made on financial hardship, he finds that Birthlink should
not avoid a penalty solely on the basis of its financial position, given the
serious nature of the infringements.
209. A claim for financial hardship will only justify a reduction in the penalty
in exceptional circumstances. However, the Commissioner considers that
a further reduction in the amount of the penalty is both proportionate
and necessary in order to avoid the risk to Birthlink’s financial
sustainability in the exceptional circumstances outlined above. In these
circumstances, a reduction in the penalty is required to avoid
irretrievably jeopardising the services provided by Birthlink.
210. The Commissioner has taken into account enforcement action on
previous cases and applied his skill and judgement to assess the
appropriate level of reduction. The Commissioner is satisfied that a
reduction to a penalty of £18,000 will appropriately reflect the
representations from Birthlink on financial hardship whilst ensuring the
penalty is effective, dissuasive and proportionate.
G. Conclusion- Penalty
211. For the reasons set out above, the Commissioner has decided to impose
an administrative penalty on Birthlink in the amount of £18,000.
