## English Summary

### Facts

In 2018, the Luxembourg DPA (the CNPD) initiated 25 different audit proceedings both in the private and public sector with regard to the role of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) under Section 4 of Chapter 4 of the GDPR (see in particular [Article 37 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR") to [Article 39 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_39_GDPR "Article 39 GDPR")).

One of these audit proceedings concerned a Luxembourg private company (hereafter, the Company). During the audit, it was found by the head of investigation of the CNPD that the Company had failed to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO), in line with [Article 37(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#1 "Article 37 GDPR").

[Article 37(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#1 "Article 37 GDPR") envisages two situations where private controllers (such as private companies) must appoint a DPO. In particular, a private controller must appoint a DPO when:

*   its (i) core activities consist of processing operations which require (ii) regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects (iii) on a large scale; or
*   its (i) core activities consist of processing (ii) on a large scale of (iii) sensitive data pursuant to [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") or [Article 10 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_10_GDPR "Article 10 GDPR").

In the case a hand, it was not contested that the Company was not processing sensitive data on a large scale. However, the audit report drafted by the head of investigation had concluded that one of the core activities of the Company was the offering of a loyalty programme to its customers, which included the processing of personal data through loyalty cards, and that such processing had to be considered as a regular and systematic monitoring of its customers on a large scale.

The head of investigation of the CNPD therefore recommended to issue an injunction against that Company to appoint a DPO, and to impose a fine of €80.000 on the Company for failure to appoint a DPO in due time.

### Holding

After reviewing the facts of the case and the applicable law, the CNPD decided against the recommendations of the head of investigation.

The CNPD first noted that the Company had completed a documented analysis on the need to appoint a DPO pursuant to [Article 37(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#1 "Article 37 GDPR"), and had concluded that it was not bound to do so.

The CNPD then agreed with the conclusion of the audit report that the offering, by the Company, of a loyalty programme to its customers was part of the core activities of the Company. The CNPD also agreed with the conclusion of the audit report that such activities were conducted on a large scale, taking into account, in particular, the number of customers concerned, and the geographical scope of the processing.

As for the third condition however, the CNPD found that the offering by the Company of a loyalty programme to its customers did not constitute a "_regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects_". The CNPD noted in this respect that the Company was processing the personal data attached to loyalty cards in order to manage its customers' account and offer them rewards, but not for monitoring their purchasing behaviors. In other words, the CNPD considered that the purpose of the processing was the management of the loyalty programme, and not the regular and systematic monitoring of the customers' behaviors.

Based on these considerations, the CNPD concluded that the conditions of [Article 37(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#1b "Article 37 GDPR") were not fulfilled, and that the Company did not have the obligation to appoint a DPO. As a consequence, the CNPD decided to close the investigation, and not to issue any injunction or impose any fine on the Company.

        1. On the principles

11. According to article 37.1 of the GDPR, "The controller and the processor designate
    in any case, a data protection officer when:

        a) the processing is carried out by a public authority or a public body,

        the exception of courts acting in the exercise of their judicial function;

        b) the core activities of the controller or processor consist of

        c) the core activities of the controller or processor consist of

        large-scale processing of special categories of data referred to in Article

        9 and personal data relating to criminal convictions and

        offenses referred to in Article 10. "

12. The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party adopted on 13 December
    2016 of the guidelines concerning DPOs which have been taken up and re-approved by

    the European Data Protection Board on May 25, 2018. These lines 3

    guidelines provide clarifications on the concepts of "core activities" and

    "Large scale" which can be found in Article 37.1.b) and c) of the GDPR as well as concerning

    the notion of "regular and systematic monitoring" found in Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR.

13. With regard to the concept of "core activities", the guidelines state that

    "\[T\] he 'core activities' can be seen as the core operations

    to achieve the objectives of the controller or processor. They

    also include all activities for which the data processing is carried out
                                                                                           4

    The guidelines state that monitoring is not limited to the "online environment". The term

    "Regular", according to the guidelines, covers "one or more of the meanings

16. As part of this audit campaign, for the head of the investigation to consider the objective

    1 as completed by the inspected, it expects the body to have appointed a DPO on 25

    May 2018 if its processing falls within the scope of Article 37.1 of the GDPR.

17. It should be noted that the inspected carried out a documented analysis, as is
                                                                       8

    8 October 2018.

18. It emerges in particular from this analysis that the inspected “considers that if \[his\] activities

    can sometimes include a dimension of large scale or regular monitoring \[…\] \[its\]
    activities do not have the two elements together. »It is also indicated that

    the controlled "does not carry out regular monitoring for customer activities (no profiling). The

    purchases are sometimes recorded on the customer card (at the customer's discretion) but are not

    used for direct marketing purposes. These data are processed only for the purposes

    restocking, customer relations when the latter calls or for the calculation of his points and
    to fulfill legal obligations. "

19. In the statement of objections, the head of the investigation refers to this analysis on page 5, "\[i\] l

    The investigation shows that \[the inspected\] did not appoint a DPO. CNPD agents

    take note that, in accordance with the guidelines for the DPO of the group
    Article 29 working group on data protection \[the inspected\] documented an analysis

    internally in collaboration with its consultants (...) in order to determine whether or not there is

    place of appointing a DPO. On the basis of this internal analysis, the position \[of the inspected\] is

    that a DPO does not seem necessary in view of the activities carried out. "

20. The head of the investigation then noted that the inspected "offers a loyalty card service to

    its customers and that there are more than \[...\] active customer cards (i.e. used in

    year). As part of the management of these customer cards, \[the inspected\] performs

    data processing including purchase history and loyalty points. The cards

    loyalty programs (...) operate in all \[controlled\] stores, as well as in
    other partner stores. "According to the investigator," the proposal of a

    loyalty program is an integral part of the activity \[of the controlled\] "; it would be

    consequent of a "basic activity" of the controlled taking into account the details provided
                                                                                9
    in the DPO guidelines on this notion.

21. As to the question of whether the inspected carries out a systematic and regular follow-up on

    based on the data collected via the loyalty card, the head of the survey considers that "\[i\] l

    According to the elements of the survey, the \[loyalty\] card makes it possible to track purchases

    of a person through loyalty points. Follow-up is organized, occurs in accordance

    loyalty. The argument that the cardholder uses it "at will" is

    inoperative. Indeed, (...) the loyalty program is part of a strategy that encourages the
    card holder to use to collect points. As soon as a customer enters

    the loyalty program, it is part of a systematic and regular monitoring system. Although

    the purpose of "monitoring" may not be pursued as such by the person in charge of
    processing, all that remains is to achieve the purposes pursued (restocking,

    customer relationship, etc ...), the data controller has set up a monitoring system

    systematic and regular. "

22. With regard to the notion of "large scale", the head of the investigation first notes "that he

    there are more than \[…\] active \[loyalty\] cards ”\[…\]. Then, with regard to the scope

    geographic location, he noted that said card "can be used in all stores \[of the

    controlled\] in the country as well as in many other partner brands. " At last,
    concerning the duration of the treatment, the head of the investigation noted that the loyalty card

    allows "to trace the purchases of its holder over a period of two years". Leader

    investigation concludes that "\[c\] owing to the number of people concerned,

    the geographical scope of the processing activity, as well as its duration (...) the card \[of
    fidelity\] must (…) be considered as a large-scale treatment within the meaning of article

    37 paragraph (1) of the GDPR. "

23. Taking into account the criteria examined by the head of the investigation in order to determine whether the control
    was and remains under the obligation to appoint a DPO, the restricted committee deduces that this

    are those of Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR, which is however not explicitly mentioned

    in the statement of objections, which only refers to Article 37.1 of the
    GDPR. The restricted training also finds that it is essentially on the basis of

    the analysis of the "management of customer cards" (or "\[loyalty\] card") processing that the manager

    investigation came to the conclusion that the inspected was and remains under the obligation to

    appoint a DPO under Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR.

24. In its position statement of April 12, 2021, the inspected returns in particular to

    the treatment in question and maintains that it does not constitute a systematic follow-up,

    considering that "the recording of data may possibly be considered
    as systematic (after each purchase and presentation of the card) but in no case

    follow-up. The purpose of processing the card is not to track purchases or

    as a follow-up. "

25. The inspected further maintains that the treatment is not regular, considering that the

    "customer card management" processing does not fall under any of the meanings of the term

    “Regular” retained by the guidelines concerning DPOs. 10

26. The inspected also indicates that the identification of the user of the loyalty card is not

    not necessary to use this one and that "\[i\] t is not uncommon for people to share

    their card making any follow-up, which is not the case here, inoperative and ineffective. "

27. As mentioned in point 23 of this decision, it is mainly on

    the basis of the analysis of the "management of customer cards" (or "\[loyalty\] card") processing
    that the head of the investigation came to the conclusion that the controlled was and remains in

    the obligation to appoint a DPO under Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR. It is therefore necessary

    to examine whether the processing in question covers each of the criteria set out in Article

    37.1.b) of the GDPR.

28. As to the question of whether the “management of customer cards” (or “\[loyalty\] card”)

    constitutes a core activity of the controller, taking into account that the

    DPO guidelines state that core activities “include

    (…) All activities for which data processing is an integral part of
    the activity of the controller ", the limited training is aligned with the assessment

    the head of the survey according to which "the proposal for a loyalty program is

    integral to the activity \[of the controlled\] "and therefore constitutes a basic activity of

    this last.

29. As to the concept of “large scale”, in the light of the recommendations made
                                                                                   12

               Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

                                                                                                            8/13 in consideration, the restricted formation agrees with the assessment of the head of investigation according to

    which “the \[loyalty\] card must (…) be considered as a high treatment

    scale within the meaning of Art.37 para. (1) GDPR. "

30. Finally, it should be examined whether the "management of customer cards" (or "card \[of

    fidelity\] ”) constitutes a“ regular and systematic follow-up ”of the persons concerned.

31. The restricted committee admits that the "management of customer cards" (or "card

    \[loyalty\] ") is carried out" in accordance with a system ". It nevertheless notes,

    given in particular the details provided by the inspected in his position paper of 12

    April 2021, referred to in points 24, 25 and 26 of this decision concerning the

    various aspects of this processing, it does not appear from the investigation file that said
    processing would aim at regular monitoring of the data subjects or such monitoring

    would actually be carried out by the controlled.

32. Therefore, it should be noted that it does not appear from the investigation file that the inspected
    is found, due to the processing "management of customer cards" (or "card \[loyalty\]"),

    in the obligation to appoint a DPO under Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR.

33. In view of the foregoing, the restricted panel concludes that the breach of article 37.1
    of the GDPR has not been established.
