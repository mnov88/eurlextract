## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject is a Hungarian politician, while the controller is a company managing several news websites and newspapers.

The controller acquired some images of the data subject’s house in Budapest through a camera installed on a drone. These images were then published on several news websites, along with statements accusing the data subject of having built his house without a building permit.

Moreover, the controller also published ob its news outlets the entries of an electronic log about the construction works.

The data subject filed a complaint with the DPA. He argued that the controller unlawfully published the data and that he was not provided with the information listed in [Articles 13](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and [14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR").

The controller, at the request of the DPA, did not clarify on which legal basis it was relying for this processing activity. Later on, the controller argued it was relying on [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") and provided the DPA with a legitimate interest test. In the latter, the controller pointed out that it needs to perform this processing activity in order to inform its readers, that it constitutes a proportionate restriction and that its purpose cannot be achieved by means of a lesser restriction. In addition, it noted that the processing is not unexpected for the data subject.

Moreover, it argued that the data from the electronic log was sent to it by an unknown person in a sealed envelope.

### Holding

First, the DPA noted that the data subject is a public figure, since he is a member of the Parliament and a politician.

Secondly, the DPA underlined how the freedom of the press and, more generally, the freedom of speech and expression have a very important role in a democratic country and are protected by the constitution.

More specifically, the DPA upheld the controller’s argument that it had a legitimate interest in performing this processing activity, given that the purpose was informing the public about the credibility of a political public figure in the context of a public issue.

Thirdly, the DPA analysed if this processing activity was actually necessary to reach this purpose. The DPA held that the recording and publication of the personal data was necessary to inform the public. Moreover, the data subject was not visible in the recordings. Therefore, the DPA was of the view that the necessity requirement was fulfilled.

Fourthly, as for the balancing test, the DPA found that the contested data processing operations did not constitute an unnecessary and disproportionate intrusion into the privacy of the data subject. On this point, the DPA stressed the fact that the data subject is not a normal citizen but a politician. Therefore, he could expect that an element of his private life was questioned by public opinion.

Therefore, it held that the controller had rightly relied on [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") for this processing activity.

Fifthly, as for the electronic log data, the DPA found a violation of [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"). Indeed, the controller failed to prove that it had sent the information provided for by this article to the data subject.

Sixthly, the DPA found a violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") since the controller did not provide the data subject with the information provided for by that article in connection with the recording and publication of his house’s images.

On these grounds, the DPA partially upheld the data subject’s complaint and issued a reprimand to the controller.

                                                14 IV.3. Scope of processed personal data

(94) When evaluating the definition of personal data, the following conceptual elements must be considered
      examine:

        - form and content criteria of the data ("any information");

        - the identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject");
        - the relationship between the data and the data subject ("relevant").

(95) In general, all information that relates to the individual,
      affects or can affect the situation of the individual in some way. The information is therefore
      since it affects the situation of the individual, it is considered personal data. Regarding the data subject
      data includes, in particular, the name and identification number of the data subject, one or more physical,
      knowledge specific to your physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity,

      as well as his image, voice and physical characteristics suitable for identifying the data subject. THE
      personal data also includes personal and family life of the individual, i.e
      so-called data belonging to the world of "privacy", but the workplace, economic or social
      facts or value judgments affecting its activities.

(96) The data subject may be any specified natural person whose personal data
      identified or - directly or indirectly - identifiable. The data subject
      in relation to the natural person status and the identifiability to be examined. One
      it must be taken into account when examining the nature of information as personal data
      on the issue of identifiability, i.e. whether the individual can be identified by given information
      based on If yes, the information is clearly considered personal data.

(97) The essential element of the concept of personal data is the connection between the information and the data subject.
      The information must be related to the data subject and must be personal data
      it remains as long as the relationship of the information with the data subject can be restored.

(98) In the Applicant's Application, the data of the e-diary relating to the construction of his family house, as well as
      criticizes Cickek's publication of photos of his family home. These data are not a
      They are about the applicant, the information carried by the data concerns objects, but at the same time the
      They relate to the applicant and are therefore considered his personal data.

(99) The working group under Article 29, Regulation No. 4/2007 on the concept of personal data
      according to his opinion (WP 136), a piece of data can be considered "relating" to an individual if
      if its use is likely to affect the rights and interests of the given person,

      taking into account all the circumstances surrounding the given case.
(100) The data cited by the Articles of the e-diary, as well as the Applicant's family home and
      The Applicant uses the photos taken of the previous house on the Applicant's property

      their rights and interests are likely to be affected, their situation is influenced, they affect the
      their situation and the perception of the electorate are likely to be affected. This
      is also supported by the fact that, according to the article of the Magyar Nemzet published on 07.05.2022, the
      in connection with construction, a complaint was filed after the publication of the Articles: "The Central
      Budapest Regional Investigative Prosecutor's Office subordinate to the Prosecutor General's Office
      investigates the report related to the Bence Tordai villa scandal, Mediaworks informed
      His news center is Péter Szabadi. The deputy spokesperson of the KNYF added: the complaint is being assessed
      still in progress. In the Tordai case, István Tényi, famous for his reports, appealed to the

      to the authorities, and in his complaint he cited the Metropol article from a few days ago."

      IV.4. The legality of the affected data management

(101) In the present case, the Authority is related to the Articles made public by the Respondent
      the legality of data management, as well as whether the Respondent complied with the preliminary requirements
      obligation to provide information.

                                                15 IV.4.1. Legal basis for recording and publishing personal data

(102) The general data protection regulation defines in points a)-f) of Article 6 (1) that
      which legal bases can be used in the case of processing personal data.

(103) According to the Authority's consistent position, related to journalistic activity
      the legal basis for data management - if it is not about voluntary consent - is the general one
      legitimate interest according to Article 6 (1) point f) of the Data Protection Regulation. The legal basis
      official practice in addition to the application of Kfv. 37.978/2021/10. also in judgment no

      confirmed. Smtv. § 10 establishes the public's right to information, i.e
      on matters of local, national and European public life, as well as the citizens of Hungary and the
      about events of importance to members of the Hungarian nation
      their right to information, states that the press is responsible for these matters and
      authentic, fast and accurate information about events. In this regard, the court referred to
      explained in his judgment: the Smtv. this provision does not require the performance of a task of public interest
      for a press organization, so the journalistic activity it carries out cannot be of public interest either

      as a task, nor as a public task in the terminology of Hungarian national law. The court
      he also pointed out that journalistic activity is linked in the Basic Law
      to specific information and to the fundamental right to information. These provisions
      according to the press, it is the duty of the press to ensure the basic constitutional rights protected in the Basic Law
      is necessary and needs protection, therefore the data management is necessary for the performance of this task
      it is essential for the press to be able to fulfill its task set out in the Smtv.

(104) According to Article 6 (1) point f) of the General Data Protection Regulation, it is legal
      data management, if it is to enforce the legitimate interests of the data controller or a third party
      necessary, unless the interests of the person concerned take precedence over these interests
      interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that make personal data protection
      necessary.

(105) The Authority first examined whether it was the Respondent or a third party
      whether you have a legitimate interest in data management. The 7/2014. (III.7.) AB decision \[39\], \[40\], \[42\] and \[48\]
      paragraphs is supported by the following essential findings to the Respondent and a

      the legitimate interest of third parties in data management.
(106) The right to free expression occupies a special place in the fundamental rights of the Basic Law
      in order. On the one hand, individual autonomy is indispensable for the possibility of free speech

      for its fulfillment, since the development of the personality is completely unimaginable
      without anyone being able to communicate their views to others freely and without restrictions on content,
      his thoughts. The free self-expression of free persons is constitutional based on the Basic Law
      one of the essential elements and meaning of order. On the other hand, freedom of speech is democratic and plural
      foundation of society and public opinion. Freedom of social and political debates and
      without its diversity, there is no democratic public opinion, no democratic rule of law.

(107) Freedom of the press - which encompasses the freedom of all types of media - is freedom of speech
      institution. Namely, the increasingly complex and diversified nature of the press's activities
      in addition to - above all, the expression of opinions, the formation of opinions and
      it is a tool for obtaining information that is essential for forming an opinion. Freedom of speech

      its privileged nature also applies to the freedom of the press in this regard, and is subject to the
      double verification of freedom: the importance of freedom of the press is determined by the subjective fundamental right and the
      the constitutional institution of democratic public opinion also confirms it.
(108) The privileged role of freedom of speech means that, on the one hand, it must only be exceptionally

      allow against other rights and constitutional values brought up for its limitation,
      on the other hand, laws restricting free expression must be interpreted restrictively.
(109) Speech concerning public figures is central to the expression of political opinion

      component. They are an essential part of the discussion of public affairs for the shapers of public affairs
      manifestations affecting his activities, views and credibility. The social and political debates
      in a significant part, they consist precisely of the fact that the actors of public life, and in the public debate -

                                               16 typically through the press - participants share each other's ideas, political achievements and

      in connection with that, they also criticize each other's personality. And for the press, it is constitutional
      its mission is to check the practitioners of public authority, which is an integral part of the
      presentation of the activities of persons and institutions involved in shaping public affairs
      and his - even extremely sharp - criticism. Despite the fact that the public
      the focus of the expression of opinion is on the public affairs themselves - not on the public figures, a
      necessarily, the majority of manifestations affecting the personality of the shapers of public affairs
      and inevitably falls under the protection of political expression. Public affairs

      the outstanding constitutional significance of its debate is therefore associated with the fact that the actors in public life
      narrower restrictions on freedom of speech and the press are responsible for the protection of his personality
      only the requirements derivable from the Basic Law. It is particularly important constitutional
      it is in the interest of citizens and the press to buy without uncertainty, compromise and fear
      participate in social and political debates. It would work against this if the speakers had a public life
      in view of the privacy protection of the actors, they should be widely held liable
      by trait.

(110) The Authority established in paragraph (18) of this decision that the Applicant
      as a member of parliament and co-chairman of a political party, he is clearly a public figure.
      It can also be stated that the Articles report on a public matter, a public matter at that

      the credibility of the actor - the Applicant - is examined: does the Applicant have a moral basis other than
      to criticize public figures for their illegal activities, or their own alleged
      his illegal behavior - according to the Articles, his illegal construction - excludes this. THE
      public debate was initiated by the Applicant, including on the Facebook page March 2022
      published on the 30th with the following statements: "it is still the Government Office's fault
      illegal, nature-destroying Csipak villa", "We will no longer tolerate the Fidesz privileged
      should be above the law, and we will not tolerate pro-state bureaucrats like Sára Botond

      they use their official power to scuttle the illegal affairs of other Fidesz criminals!",
      "There is no place in the National Assembly to ignore both the rule of law and natural resources
      for politicians!"
(111) The Respondent fulfills its and its readers' legitimate interest in data management with the following

      substantiated: the data made public in the objected articles by the editors,
      as media organs, it is one of the most widely-interested and prominent subjects of our time
      was used to form opinions in his public debate in order to public opinion
      within the framework of freedom of expression, the resulting freedom of the press and
      properly informed through the exercise of the right to information as a fundamental right,
      thereby contributing to the public debate and its merits. The subject of the public debate is a
      The applicant, as an active public figure, is a politician in violation of the law, which is suitable for

      to influence the public perception of the Applicant's credibility as a public figure and politician,
      and which, for this reason, has been covered by several media outlets in the past period.
(112) Given that the purpose of the Respondent's data management is to inform the public

      concerning the credibility of a political figure in public life, especially with such a public matter
      in context, the public discussion of which was initiated by the Applicant, a
      Authority determines that for data management both the Requested and
      readers have a legitimate interest.

(113) Article 6 (1) point f) of the General Data Protection Regulation to the Authority
      within the scope of its applicability, it then had to examine whether the data management
      is it necessary to enforce the legitimate interest of the Respondent or a third party, i.e. a
      Is the aggrieved party required to provide information on a public matter identified in articles
      data management.

(114) The Articles examine the credibility of the Applicant public figure. To check authenticity
      a report on a suspected violation is clearly required. The Applicant
      a report on the presumed illegal construction of the affected property was prepared
      the Articles support it with photos and e-log data.

                                                17(115) The Authority therefore concludes that the recording of the Applicant's personal data and

     publication to enforce the legitimate interest of the Applicant and the readers, i.e. a
     it was necessary to provide information about the credibility of a political public figure.  THE
     the Applicant and his family members are not visible in the recordings, even in the data of the e-diary
     the details of the conversion of the former residential building are included in the Articles
     are related to the extent. According to the Authority's point of view, the information provided in the Articles is personal
     data therefore do not exceed the substantiation of the alleged violation and about it
     the range of data required for providing information.

(116) After that, the Authority had to consider whether the Applicant's
     interests or fundamental rights and freedoms against the legitimate interest of the Respondent.

(117) In considering the interests and fundamental rights, it is necessary as an important factor that
     to appear in the Mtv., according to Section 7 (2) of which the protection of the home is a matter of public interest
     it also enjoys increased protection in the case of actors.

(118) At the same time, the Authority refers to the 7/2014. (III.7.) also to paragraph \[57\] of the AB decision, where
     The Constitutional Court explains: "However, the person affected by the speech cannot be ignored
     nor the status of a person: the persons exercising public power and the politicians in public roles
     in his case, the limitation of personal protection is broader than for everyone else
     is considered "necessary and proportionate". On the one hand, they changed based on their own decision

     become more active shapers of public affairs than others, thus undertaking the publicity of the affected community
     prior evaluations and criticisms, so you are involved in the discussion of public affairs
     they have to tolerate expressions of opinion that attack them with more patience.
     On the other hand, those exercising public power and public politicians are broader than everyone else
     in a circle and can use mass communication tools more effectively for them
     against attacks. Thirdly, in their case, the criticism of their person and
     classification by the social public is inherently different, the democratic debate is necessary

     as part of it, typically to be interpreted along the lines of different political interests
     treats it as a manifestation. In Hungary, the plural has developed in the recent period
     the peculiarities of the operation of political publicity, including during public debates
     society can evaluate what has been said with due caution".

(119) In paragraphs \[29\] and \[31\] of the same decision, the Constitutional Court refers to
     Also to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter: ECtHR). In public affairs
     As an argument in favor of wider criticism of acting politicians, the ECtHR explained that a
     politicians consciously and inevitably expose themselves to the fact that journalists and
     wider public opinion should both closely follow their every word and
     their actions. Consequently, they have to be more patient with criticism

     against, especially when they themselves participate in the public debate \[ECtHR,
     Oberschlick v Austria (11662/85), 23 May 1991, para 59\]. Public actors,
     especially with regard to politicians, at the same time, there may be a case where the
     in special circumstances related to the discussion of public affairs, not only with the
     public participation, but also in relation to the private life of the person concerned, must be taken into account
     public opinion's right to information \[ECtHR, Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2)
     (40660/08 and 60641/08), February 7, 2012, paragraph 110\].

(120) The 26/2019 (VII.23.) In paragraph \[33\] of the AB decision, the Constitutional Court is the public actor
     regarding the disclosure of information about his private life, he highlighted: "That
     Basic Law II. and VI. exceptional public figures also enjoy the protection of Article By them

     their undisclosed activities not related to public affairs
     (the protected part of their private life) cannot be made public by the media pursuant to Art. IX of the Basic Law. to his article
     with reference. If, on the other hand, the subject of the public debate is a slice of private life,
     then - closely in this circle - freedom of expression should be prioritized
     favor".

(121) The personal data published in the Articles relate to the Applicant's private life. However
     precisely this slice of his private life is the subject of public debate: the public figures, presumably

                                              18 to what extent will the illegal constructions remain without legal consequences, will they be paid for this

      help from their contacts in decision-making positions.
(122) As a political public figure, the Applicant could count on the public debate he initiated
      for its credibility to be examined in relation to the subject of the dispute and the investigation

      the public will be informed of the result. It may not apply to all public debates
      a public figure that certain areas of his private life are made public,
      however, when the subject of the public debate initiated by him is a public figure, it is illegal
      construction, i.e. a matter affecting the private sector, then he had to expect that his own
      the legality of his construction, this slice of his private life also became part of the public debate
      can become

(123) The Authority established that the objectionable data management operations were not reported
      unnecessary and disproportionate interference in the Applicant's private life, since a
      Data management was necessarily connected to the public matter discussed in the articles, furthermore
      the Articles only assume footage of the property and the construction

      e-log data to support its illegality were shared, privacy
      other moments that are not necessary to support the credibility of the Applicant
      not immortalized. The Authority therefore refuses the Applicant to establish it
      your request that the Respondent handled your personal data illegally. THE
      The Authority also rejects the Applicant's request, according to which a
      Authority to order the Applicant to delete his unlawfully processed personal data,
      or impose a fine.

      IV.4.2. Information on data management
(124) The Applicant requested a finding of violation of Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation,

      in view of the fact that the management of the e-diary data by individual media outlets, furthermore
      in the case of the photos being taken and made public, the preview did not take place
      information.

      IV.4.2.1. Information on the recording and publication of e-diary data

(125) According to the consistent position of the Authority, which the Metropolitan Court
      104.K.701.309/2021/15.   judgment no. was also confirmed, the person carrying out press activities
      data controllers are also obliged to provide information according to Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation
      provide to those concerned. The judgment of the Metropolitan Court states that “Everything

(126) Despite the Authority's repeated invitations, the Respondent did not declare that
      Did you provide individualized information to the applicant? Regarding your information, the Applicant
      he did not give a specific answer, but explained that it is general available on the website of the data controller

      information sheet contains information about data management. The Applicant that
