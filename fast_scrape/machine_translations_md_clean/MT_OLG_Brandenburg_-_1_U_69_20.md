## English Summary

### Facts

A defendant appealed a first instance decision by the Regional Court of Potsdam. In that case, they made an unsuccessful counterclaim for set-off of damages they owed on account of the unauthorized further use of their photograph and name in connection with the plaintiff's Internet presence.

### Holding

The Higher Regional Court of Brandenburg held that a claim for damages can only arise from [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR") if concrete damage has been sufficiently presented by the claimant. It rejected the appeal and stated that such a claim had no material prospect of success in this case. It justified its approach by reference to [a decision by the Higher Regional Court of Bremen](/index.php?title=OLG_Bremen_-_1_W_18/21 "OLG Bremen - 1 W 18/21"), which followed the same legal approach regarding an [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR") claim.
