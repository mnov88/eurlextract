## English Summary

### Facts

The Labour Chamber of the Spanish National High Court dealt with an appeal from a case in which a trade union sued a company for not providing their workers a corporate email and asking for a personal email instead (among other things).

The workers were working remotely since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the company demanded their private emails in order to be able to communicate with the workers for diverse matters such as holidays requests, leaves, etc. This was established by a clause in their contracts.

The company had also previously agreed to provide corporate emails to the workers.

Additionally, the company had suffered a data breach in which their employees' private emails had been compromised.

Upon this, the trade union had also asked the company to provide the list of such emails so they could communicate with the workers. The company replied that they would not provide the workers' emails without their consent.

### Holding

Given these facts, the Court first remarks that the law obliges the employer to provide their workers every means necessary to achieve develop their professional activity.

In this regard, also, the law regulating remote work, passed in 2020, establishes that in any case, companies shall be obliged to provide the means, equipment, tools and consumables required for the development of remote work.

Additionally, the Court highlights that the Court's case law has already established that demanding workers to provide their personal email or phone is a violation of GDPR, since, should they be necessary for the development of the workers' activity, they should hence be provided by the company.

Therefore, the company would have breach the data minimisation principle from [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR").

With regard to the union's demand to provide a list of the workers' emails, the Court stated that, also according to the Court's case law, providing such list does not require consent since it is necessary for the development of the purposes of the right (and freedom) to form a union enshrined in Article 7 of the Spanish Constitution. Therefore, such processing would be lawful in accordance with [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

the NOTE BOARD application of Google Chrome to generate boards that would be integrated into the portal of the
employee, which was declined by the social representation for its poor performance.

by the company does not allow posting communications.
The rest of the participating unions joined these petitions.
The company opposed the lawsuit requesting the issuance of a judgment rejecting the lawsuit.
He indicated that there is no ordinary remote work situation but that the telework situation is palliative
by COVID and not ordinary.

of the request.
As reasons for opposition he mentioned the following:

corporate email access being necessary, sufficing with a URL accessing with Google
Chrome just a username, password, country and job site;

the present process was contradictory to what was agreed with the company because they did not challenge as MSCT the

Legal provisions have been met.
FOUNDATIONS OF LAW
FIRST.- The Social Chamber of the National High Court is competent to hear the present process of
in accordance with the provisions of articles 9, 5 and 67 of Organic Law 6/85, of July 1, on the Judiciary
, in relation to the provisions of articles 8.1 and 2 g) of Law 36/2011, of October 10, Regulating
Social Jurisdiction.
SECOND. - In accordance with the provisions of article 97, 2 of Law 36/2011, of October 10, the
wording of the factual result of this resolution rests either on conforming facts, or the
sources of evidence that are expressed in them.
THIRD.- In the two joined lawsuits that are being processed in this proceeding, it is requested in
first place that the business requirement to make the mail available is declared contrary to law
personal email to complete the activity management and human resources operations, as well as the
clauses of teleworking contracts that oblige workers to make available
of this means to which the second of the petitions is tied, by virtue of which it is requested to declare the
The company's obligation to make a corporate email available to telecommuting staff as a means of
necessary for the development of the activity.
The company is fundamentally opposed for two reasons: firstly, it is alleged that personal mail
It is not necessary for the execution of the activity of the telemarketers that in any case can
access company information through the employee portal and that are not applicable to
workers the LTD regulations and the doctrine of this Chamber in this regard, since it does not apply to
teleworking imposed as a result of art. 5 of RD Law 8/2020.
From the facts stated above, the following can be deduced:
1º.- that the previous owner of the company undertook before the SIMA to make available to the staff
corporate email accounts;
2º.- that the clauses of the teleworking contracts oblige the people who opt for such modality of
provision of services to provide the company with a personal email account;
3º.- that in order to carry out procedures related to the company, an email is necessary;
4º- that on the occasion of a cyber attack suffered by the company in September 2021 the company communicated
to the staff the measures to be adopted in relation to personal mail.
Such data makes vanish the employer's allegation regarding which the email is not necessary
for the development of the existing contractual relationship between employees and company, since this of a
side assumed ex art. 44.1 ET the previous ones of the previous holder of the same in front of the staff, and their own
acts show that the correct development of the contractual relationship requires the existence of a
communication via email between company and employee.
Based on the above, we must point out:
1.- That it is the doctrine of both this Chamber and Chamber IV of the Supreme Court; the absence of the employment contract
(ex art. 1.1 E.T) implies, among other things, alienation in the media, which implies that the employer is the
that it has to provide the worker with the necessary means for the development of their employment relationship
(STS of 8-2-2021- rec 84/2019- confirming SAN of 6-2-2019- proc.318/2018-; SAN of 10-5-2021- cars
105/2021).
2.-That on the other hand, already the STS of 9-21-2015 - rec259/2014- which confirms the SAN of 1-28-2014- cars 428/2013-
considered contrary to the then current national and European regulations on data protection
that the worker was forced to provide his email and his personal telephone number to the company,
reasoning that if they were essential for the development of the contract both one and the other
must be provided by the company to the worker.
6
JURISPRUDENCE
3.- That the Third Transitory Provision of the Distance Work Law provides that:
"To remote work implemented exceptionally in application of article 5 of Royal Decree-law 8/2020, of
March 17, or as a consequence of the health containment measures derived from COVID-19, and while
these are maintained, the ordinary labor regulations will continue to apply.
In any case, companies will be obliged to provide the means, equipment, tools and consumables that
requires the development of remote work, as well as the necessary maintenance."
The application of the above considerations has to lead us to the estimation of the first two petitions
of the demand since it is necessary for the worker to have an email account as
we reasoned above, it is the employer who is obliged to provide it, without being excused for that purpose the
cost thereof, or the risk of a cyber attack, as the company has suggested, since the employer who has
to assume the risks of its business activity by providing the staff with the necessary means for the
development of the same even in remote work adopted as a preventive measure of COVID 19.
To this must be added, that the company not having accredited that there is currently a containment measure
adopted as a result of the pandemic, said request would also have support in art. 11 of the LTD.
Finally, we must say that the fact that 20 days have elapsed since the company left
providing the email to the template does not imply that we are faced with a modification
substantial consolidated working conditions insofar as:
a) the working conditions that are modifiable via art. 41 E.T are only those whose source
normative is of a contractual nature, and as we have reasoned, the principle of alienation has its origin in
the legal definition of the employee is made in art. 1.1 E.T;
b) for the expiration period of art. 138.1 of the LRJS requires reliable and written notification
of the modification by the employer to the workers or their legal representatives, and nothing is recorded
regarding such notification in this regard in the HHPP of this sentence.
FOURTH. - In the last of the petitions of their respective demands, the actors request:
1º.- by CGT to declare the right to make available the necessary elements for the development
of its representative activity between the RLT and the remote workers in the company, as well as
corporate emails already implemented;
2º.- By CCOO that the business refusal to provide the necessary resources is declared contrary to law
to guarantee communication between the social representation and the staff in the teleworking modality.
To resolve such motions we have the content of art. 8 of the LOLS which states that:
"1. Workers affiliated to a union may, within the scope of the company or workplace:
a) Establish Union Sections in accordance with the provisions of the Union Statutes.
b) Hold meetings, prior notification to the employer, collect dues and distribute union information, outside
working hours and without disturbing the normal activity of the company.
c) Receive the information sent by your union.
2. Without prejudice to what is established by collective agreement, the Trade Union Sections of the trade unions
most representative and of those who have representation in the company committees and in the governing bodies.
representation that are established in the Public Administrations or have personnel delegates,
will have the following rights:
a) In order to facilitate the dissemination of those notices that may be of interest to members of the union and to
workers in general, the company will put at their disposal a notice board that must be placed in the
work center and in a place where adequate access to it for workers is guaranteed.
b) To collective bargaining, in the terms established in its specific legislation.
c) To the use of a suitable place in which they can carry out their activities in those companies or
work centers with more than 250 workers.
From said precept, it can be inferred in regard to the present case that in order to guarantee the right to union activity
in the company (art. 2.1 d) and art. 2.2 d), the employer must, on the one hand, guarantee the right to information
on the part of the trade union organizations to the workforce, and on the other hand, to provide the trade union sections with
the implementation referred to in the precept a bulletin board that is easily accessible by
workers.
7
JURISPRUDENCE
On the other hand, we have pointed out in the recent SAN of 6-23-2022 issued in procedure 145/2022 that
the provision of personal data by the employer to trade unions that are necessary for the
development of the purposes referred to in art. 7 of the EC; does not require the authorization of
these because it is a lawful treatment protected by art. 6.1 of 4 Regulation 2016/679 of
European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016.
Based on the foregoing, the factual relationship of this resolution follows:
1º.- that the defendant has a considerable part of its staff providing services in a telecommuting regime;
2º.- that he has refused to provide the emails of the staff for the dissemination of information
trade union arguing that it is personal data;
3º.- that the only telematic tool that it has provided to guarantee the existence of a notice board
announcements of the union sections is an external tool linked to the employee portal regarding
the one that the union sections have denounced, among other things that so that advertising is not inserted there is
have to pay a subscription, and have limited content of the information to hang in it (50 megabytes).
From the foregoing, the existence of the business breach is evidenced, the illegality of which is intended to be declared
by the plaintiffs, since it is evident that the company, without excuse related to the normal development of the
business activity has hindered the right of the plaintiffs to disseminate trade union information to the people
that provide teleworking services and has not provided the union sections with a tool
where they can freely and unhindered post the notices they deem convenient, sending them
to a third-party application to which such organizations must subscribe if they do not wish to have messages inserted
advertisements that limits the volume of files to upload.
Finally, we understand that in the present case, in which the company considers it necessary that all the
people who provide services in a telecommuting regime - as this is required in the contracts - have a
email that to guarantee the right to disseminate union information it is necessary that you provide
to the union sections the mail directory of the employees for being the only means that allows such
law without interference by the defendant.
And all this while there were containment measures derived from COVID 19, once, the
same, said requests would also have support in the provisions of art. 19.2 of the LTD ("The company
must provide the legal representation of the workers with the necessary elements for the
development of its representative activity, including access to communications and electronic addresses
of use in the company and the implementation of the virtual board, when it is compatible with the form of provision of the
remote work"), which forces the company directly to implement the virtual board without the preparation
of the same may be displaced to the action carried out by trade union organizations with a third party.
