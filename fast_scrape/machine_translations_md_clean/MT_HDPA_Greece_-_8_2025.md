## English Summary

### Facts

Throughout 2024, the DPA received 15 complaints from various data subjects, regarding unsolicited communication via short text messages (SMS) by the dating agency _ANOIXIS_, the controller.

The DPA considered the sender of these unsolicited SMS to be the same controller who had been previously fined €54,000 according to the DPA's decision 16/2022, for unsolicited communication, after having received 36 complaints from data subjects.

As part of the examination of the complaints, the DPA sent the controller a number of documents equal to the number of complaints (15), requesting their views on the attached complaints, none of which were answered.

Subsequently, the DPA sent the controller an official summons to a hearing on 30/10/2024 in order to present their views regarding the 15 filed complaints within the year 2024. The controller, however, did not attend.

### Holding

The DPA held that the issue of conducting unsolicited communications through any means of electronic communication, without human intervention, for the purposes of direct commercial promotion of products or services and for any kind of advertising purposes, is regulated by [Article 11 Law 3471/2006 on the protection of personal data in the field of electronic communications](https://www.dpa.gr/sites/default/files/2019-09/%CE%9D3471_06.PDF), which incorporated [(eprivacy-)Directive 2002/58/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02002L0058-20091219) into the national legal framework. According to [Article 11(1) Law 3471/2006](https://www.dpa.gr/sites/default/files/2019-09/%CE%9D3471_06.PDF), such communication is only allowed if the subscriber has explicitly given prior consent.

According to [Article 11(3) Law 3471/2006](https://www.dpa.gr/sites/default/files/2019-09/%CE%9D3471_06.PDF), any electronic message is permitted without the prior consent of the data subject only if the contact details have been lawfully obtained in the context of a previous sale of products or services or another transaction, and they can be used for the direct promotion of similar products or services of the provider or for similar purposes. Additionally, the data subject must have been informed at the time of data collection about their use for communication purposes and must not have objected to this use.

Furthermore, according to Article 31 of GDPR, the controller and the processor, and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, upon request, with the DPA in the performance of its tasks.

Finally, the DPA held that with its Decision 16/2022, a fine of €54,000 had already been imposed to the said controller, following the examination of thirty-six (36) complaints previously submitted to the DPA on the same matter. These complaints concerned the violation of the aforementioned provisions of [Article 11 Law 3471/2006](https://www.dpa.gr/sites/default/files/2019-09/%CE%9D3471_06.PDF), as well as the lack of cooperation by the controller. Based on the above, there has been no compliance with the aforementioned Decision.

For the above reasons the DPA imposed a total fine of €45,000.

Additionally, the DPA requested that the Hellenic Telecommunications and Post Commission (EETT) examine the accuracy of the registration details of the domain name 'www.anoixisdate.gr' and take all appropriate actions, as, for example, the application of Article 10 of the Domain Name Management and Assignment Regulation for domain names ending in .gr or .ελ, regarding the deletion of the assigned domain name.

Authority with the above information. This information verifies the already known contact

Regional Police Station the transmittal document (ref. no. G/EXE/2775/15-10-2024) in order

The Authority, after considering all the information on the record and referring to the
deliberations of the meeting of 13-11-2024, having heard the Rapporteur and the
clarifications of the Assistant Rapporteur, and after a thorough discussion,
THOUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW
1. In accordance with Article 4(4). 7 of the General Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the
protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data (hereinafter,
4
Regulation), which has been in force since 25 May 2018, a controller is defined as "the
natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly
with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data".
2. The issue of making unsolicited communications by any means of electronic
communication, without human intervention, for the purposes of direct marketing of
products or services and for any kind of advertising purposes is regulated in article 11 of
Law no. 3471/2006 on the protection of personal data in the electronic communications
sector, which transposed Directive 2002/58/EC into national law. According to this
article (paragraph 1), such communication is only allowed if the subscriber has given
his/her explicit prior consent.
According to paragraph 3 of the said article, any electronic mail without the prior
consent of the data subject is allowed only if, among other things, the contact details
have been lawfully obtained in the context of a previous sale of products or services or
other transaction and may be used for the direct promotion of similar products or
services of the supplier or for similar purposes and the data subject was informed at the
time of collection of the data about the use of the data for the purpose of
communication and did not disclose the data to the data subject.
3. Pursuant to Article 31 of the Regulation, the controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives shall cooperate, upon request, with the supervisory
authority in the performance of its tasks.
4. As is apparent from the evidence in the files of the complaints under consideration, similarly to what was stated in the Authority's Decision 16/2022, none of the complainants had expressly consented in advance to receive promotional messages from the controller, nor did they have any prior commercial contact or other relationship
with the in order to have their contact details lawfully obtained so as not to require their
prior consent for the sending of those messages, as set out in the Authority's Decision
16/2022. 1 of Law no. 3471/2006.
5
5. Similarly to Decision 16/2022, the controller did not cooperate with the Authority as it
did not reply, on several occasions, to any of the numerous documents clarifications sent
to it e-mail and by post and did not attend the Authority's meeting, where it was invited
to explain itself.
6. The Authority, by Decision 16/2022, has already imposed a sanction on this controller,
namely a fine of fifty-four thousand (54,000) Euros, following the examination of thirty-
six (36) complaints that had been submitted to the Authority previously with the same
subject matter for violation of the above provisions of article 11 of Law no. 3471/2006,
as well as for the lack of cooperation of the Processing Manager. On the basis of the
above, no compliance has been made with the above Decision.
7. In accordance with Article 13 par. 3 of Law 3471/2006, the cases in which an opinion of
the National Telecommunications and Postal Commission (NTC) is foreseen, the latter
gives its opinion upon a subscriber's request or a request of the Personal Data Protection
Authority or ex officio.
On the basis of the above, the Authority unanimously considers that, in accordance
with Article 11 of Law No. 3471/2006 and Article 31 of the GDPR, the conditions for the
imposition of a penalty against the controller are met, on the basis of Article 13 of the Act.
3471/2006, in conjunction with Article 58(58) of Regulation (EC) No 3471/2006. 2(i) of the
GDPR, the administrative sanction referred to in the operative part of this order, which is
proportionate to the gravity of the infringement.
FOR THESE REASONS
Impose on the controller the effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative
fine appropriate to the specific case in accordance with the specific circumstances of the
case, amounting to forty-five thousand Euro (45.000,00 €), for above violations of article 11 of Law No. 3471/2006 and Article 31 of the
GDPR.
It requests the National Telecommunications and Postal Services Commission (EETT)
to examine the accuracy of the data in the registration declaration of the
'www.anoixisdate.gr' Domain Name and to take any appropriate action, such as, for
example, the application of Article 10 of the Regulation on the Management and Assignment
of Domain Names ending in .gr or .ελ. regarding the deletion of the assigned Domain Name.
