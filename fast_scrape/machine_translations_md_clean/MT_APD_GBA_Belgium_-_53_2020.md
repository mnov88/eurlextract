- the plaintiff ;
- the defendant: a politician.
1. Facts and procedure
Decision on the merits 53/2020 - 2/13
1. On May 25, 2019, the complainant filed a request for information with the
protection of data concerning the defendant's use of his e-mail address

our team at the College and Provincial Council to be even more effective. I wish to put everything

3. By letter dated July 2, 2019, the Data Protection Authority's Front-Line Service
invited the plaintiff to exercise his rights with the defendant, in this case, his right of opposition
to the processing of his personal data. At the same time, by letter dated July 2, 2019, the

and what steps have been taken to ensure that this type of incident does not happen again.

addressed in March 2014 by the complainant to the secretariat of the mayor of the city of X. to report
a problem of public cleanliness. More specifically, it was an e-mail addressed to
"secretariat.bourgmestre@X.be " concerning a clandestine landfill site near the former
city walls for which the complainant requested the cleanup. On July 4, in his letter

duly completed in the appendix, allow me to contradict a few elements contained in your letter: page 3- point 1 -

but also, according to the defendant's statements, of emails addressed to him personally, which were
which was not the case with regard to the complainant's e-mail which was indeed collected via the secretariat
of the mayor.
5. With regard to the modus operandi for sending the disputed email, the defendant responded to the
questions from the Data Protection Authority by co-signing the following explanation provided by
the municipal employee who was his secretary when he was mayor:
"In fact, from my private messaging service, I sent an election advertisement for the defendant, in order to
to avoid using his professional messaging in his capacity as an MPP. \[...\] And this e-mail has
was sent spontaneously, omitting to put in CCI the recipients. There is therefore no
intention to misuse these addresses or harm anyone else. It is just a mistake of
manipulation that we regret. We have apologized to the complainant as you have
could read it".2
6. As a result of these responses, the complainant confirmed to ODA's Front-Line Service that he was willing to
that his request for information be forwarded as a complaint to the ODA Litigation Chamber,
by letters dated July 11 and 26, 2019. On August 6, 2019, the Front Line Service of the Authority of
The data protection authority declared the complaint admissible and forwarded it to the Litigation Chamber.

as to the substance pursuant to articles 95 § 1, 1° and 98 LCA. On the same date, the Dispute Chamber
forwarded the complaint and exhibits to the defendant by registered letter and invited the parties to
argue their case according to a set timetable. The letter stated that "each of the parties is
to transmit its conclusions simultaneously to the secretariat of the Litigation Chamber and to
the other party".
8. By letter dated October 14, 2019, received October 18, 2019, the defendant states that it is
is at the disposal of the Litigation Chamber to be heard if the Chamber so wishes. The
in his brief letter, the defendant explains that he confirms "that the sending of the file to all of the
people was a simple handling error at the time of sending the document that was \[sic\]

been in contact with the commune for various questions". Answer: this statement is not correct. I had

9. The respondent also states that it "sought the advice of an expert in the new
legislation "to help him coach his team" in order to avoid any future mistakes by the
like". The defendant states that the question of what precautions should be taken with
e-mail addresses that people have not spontaneously transmitted, is still under analysis. The
the defendant concluded that he thought he was entitled to contact the persons who had given him their
address, and that he is now aware that this is "obviously not so obvious".
10. In an email dated November 7, 2019, the plaintiff introduced his arguments such as the calendar
of conclusion invited him to do so. On that occasion, the complainant reported that he had not received the findings of the
the elements of his complaint, and asks to retain as an aggravating circumstance the following
that the denounced violations were committed by a politician in the exercise of his mandate.
11. The Litigation Chamber resumed the case by written procedure on July 3, 2020 and adopted the following decision

the amount of the fine envisaged against it, as well as a list of the breaches observed at the
RGPD and justifying this amount. In particular, the Chamber found that the Respondent did not submit
its findings to the complainant. The defendant was invited, by the same e-mail, to put forward its pleas in law.

2. Violations of the GDMP
12. The defendant in his capacity as burgomaster at the time of the collection of the e-mail address
concerned, is the person responsible for processing the personal data file that he or she has
constituted from the data of citizens addressing his secretariat and/or himself
personally for various requests. It is his responsibility to ensure that the data
have been processed on an appropriate legal basis and in compliance with the law.

appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure, in particular, that the data does not

by the defendant himself that he was a mayor at the time the disputed e-mail address was
collected (email to "secretariat.bourgmestre@....be"). The Dispute Chamber takes note

the part of the data collected from emails sent to the secretariat of the mayor, the Chamber

that mayor, at the very least, the email of the complainant.
13. On the basis of these elements of the file, the Litigation Chamber considers that it is established
that the defendant used to send out election mailings a list of citizens who were in
contact with the commune of which the defendant was then mayor, for various questions related to
to its function as a public representative, and that the personal data collected in this context would have

necessary for this purpose (Article 24 of the GDMP).
15. The purpose principle is an angular principle of data protection. Dedicated from
1981 to Article 5 b) of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data.
of the Council of Europe (ETS 108), it is set out at
Article 6.1.b) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 24, 1995
relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data
and the free circulation of this data as well as in article 4 § 1, 2° of the Law of December 8, 2009.

personal. When the right to data protection is enshrined as a fundamental right
by Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in 2000, the principle of
purpose has been stated as a key element of this right4. This principle has, logically, been taken up again at
Article 5.1(b) of the GDPR under the Principles for the Processing of Personal Data
(Chapter II).
16. Article 5.1(b) of the GDMP provides that :
« 1. Personal data must be : (...) (b) collected for the following purposes
and legitimate, and not to be further processed in a particular, explicit and legitimate manner, and not to be
incompatible with these purposes; further processing for archival purposes in the interest of

considered, also taking into account the framework in which the personal data were considered, and the
collected, the possible consequences of the envisaged further processing for the data subject
and the existence of appropriate guarantees.
18. A compatible purpose is, for example, a purpose that the data subject can foresee
or that can be considered compatible by virtue of a legal provision (see Article 6.4. of the
RGPD). Based on the criteria in section 6.4 of the EDR: there is no link between the two.

concerning the management of the commune in the treatment of the answers to the questions of the citizens,
the other that of the relations between an elector and a candidate for an elective mandate. This incompatibility
is further evidenced by the fact that the applicable law allows candidates in elections to have access to
to a voters' list specially dedicated to the realization of their campaign.
19. Any subsequent incompatible use is prohibited with two exceptions provided for in Article
6.4. of the RGPD. Where the data subject has given his consent to further processing in order to
a distinct purpose or where the processing operation is based on a legal provision which constitutes an
necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society, in particular to ensure the guarantee of
important purposes in the public interest, the data controller has the possibility of processing
subsequently these personal data for other purposes, whether or not they are compatible with the purpose for which they were collected.

20. The purpose of advertising/electoral propaganda is not a further purpose of processing
data compatible with the original purpose of collecting data from citizens in the context of

Updated following the implementation of the DPGR6
the Data Protection Authority mentions
that :
"However, political parties and their candidates in an election may be tempted to have
use of personal data collected in the context of other processing operations
whose primary purpose had nothing to do with electoral propaganda. This is true as well
for data retrieved from public sector files (such as the National Registry, the
data from public service personnel files, a list of people assisted by
a CPAS, data obtained in the exercise of an alderman's mandate, ...) that

members of an association, ...)".

a burgomaster of personal data collected in the course of his duties for the purposes of
incompatible, is such as to undermine the foundations of democracy and equality between the
candidates.

Litigation considers that the defendant, according to its own statements, processed data to
personal character of the citizens of his commune, and in particular those of the complainant, in violation of
section 5.1.b of the MDR (purpose limitation) of the MDR and section 6 of the MDR (lawfulness of the

such data breaches to the competent authority when the conditions for the application of Article
33 of the RGPD are gathered together. In this case, no such notification has been introduced, which constitutes
also an infringement of the GDMP.
25. In summary, in light of the inspection report and taking into account the Respondent's findings,
the Litigation Chamber establishes the following violations of the GDR :
- Violation of articles 5.1.a, 5.1.b) and 6.1 of the RGPD, given that by sending the disputed email,
the defendant processed the plaintiff's personal data without a legal basis and in
violation of the purpose for which these data were collected by the Secretariat of the
mayor (answer his questions).
- Violation of sections 25.1 and 25.2 of the MPR, which require the person responsible to
processing to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to
guarantee that, by default, only the personal data that are necessary to the
with regard to each specific purpose of the treatment are processed.
- Violation of articles 32.1 and 32.4 of the RGPD, since a person acting under
the defendant's authority has sent the plaintiff's email contact information to third parties, in the context of
of an e-mail where all the recipients were visible. Violation of article 33 of the RGPD being
given that this data leak was not notified to the DPA.

Decision on the merits 53/2020 - 9/13
3. Corrective action
26. The Litigation Chamber has already had the opportunity to rule on cases of unlawful treatment
of data for electoral purposes in the following cases : Decision 11-2019 of November 25, 2019;
Decision 10-2019 of November 25, 2019; Decision 04/2019 of May 28, 2019 and Decision 30/2020 of November 8, 2019; Decision 10-2019 of November 25, 2019; Decision 04/2019 of May 28, 2019 and Decision 30/2020 of May 8, 2019.
June 202010.
27. In these four cases, the Litigation Chamber imposed administrative fines,
in particular for non-compliance with the principle of finality, enshrined in article 5.1.b of the GDMP. These were
in these cases, the unlawful further processing for electoral purposes of data of a personal nature for the
personal data collected (at least with regard to the e-mail address at issue on 22 May 2019)
within the framework of the exercise of communal competences. The present case is part of this
jurisprudence.
28. The Litigation Chamber considers that the breaches it has identified (infra, § 22)
justify the imposition of administrative fines in accordance with articles 100, 13° and 101 of the ACL
as well as 83 of the DPGR, and this taking into account the following.
29. First, the nature and seriousness of the breaches are taken into account (section 83, 1,
(a) of the DPGR). Indeed, breaches of Articles 5.1.b (inconsistent subsequent treatment),5.1.a
(lawfulness) and 6.1 of the GDPMR (unlawful processing) identified in this Decision constitute
breaches of the fundamental principles of data protection. These include
violations for which the maximum fine amounts are the highest (Section 83.5 of the
RGPD).
30. Second, the Litigation Chamber considers that the quality of the defendant, at the time
of the data collection, namely that of the mayor, and subsequently the quality of
the time the litigious e-mail was sent11 , constitutes an aggravating circumstance at the time of the sending of the litigious e-mail.
under section 83.2.k. In view of this role played by the defendant in public life, he could

11 The Litigation Chamber notes the clarification made by the defendant in his letter of 6 July 2020 to the Chamber
that he was no longer mayor at the time the disputed email was sent. The contentious Chamber notes

Decision on the merits 53/2020 - 10/13
in compliance with all applicable rules and, in this case, with the rules for the protection of
data.
31. Finally, the Litigation Chamber takes note of the fact that the defendant exposes his good
willingness to implement the DPGR, in that it states that it "sought the advice of an expert in the
new legislation "to help him coach his team" in order to avoid any new mistakes in the future.
of the kind" (see § 9 above). The Litigation Chamber cannot take into account the entry into force of the
of the DPGR as a mitigating circumstance, as the observed violations of the purpose and principles of the
lawfulness are not new elements in data protection legislation.
personal. In its note on "Elections" published in the early 2000s on the website of
the DPA and updated following the entry into force of the DPR12, the Data Protection Authority
already mentioned the ban on reusing data extracted from the
public sector (such as the National Registry, data from the
list of people assisted by a CPAS, data obtained from the public health care system, a list of
the exercise of an alderman's mandate, ...) or data from private sector files (client file of a
company, list of members of an association, ...)".
32. These principles already formed the cornerstone of the Parliament Directive 95/46/EC
European Parliament and Council of October 24, 1995 (art. 6.1.b and art. 6.1.a and 7), which the RGPD replaced. It

under the old Directive (art. 17), which has been strengthened and clarified in the GDMP in article
32 in particular.
33. The Litigation Chamber further notes that according to the facts transmitted to it, the

proof that such a communication has been made (recommended or proof of sending an email). The mail

to the secretariat of the Litigation Chamber and to the other party". However, the plaintiff pointed out that he had not
not received the conclusions of the defendant, who is therefore in default of at least providing proof of
its full cooperation in this procedure. However, the defendant did receive the letter
of September 25, 2019 inviting it to conclude by October 25, 2019 at the latest, and to forward
its conclusions simultaneously to the other party. The defendant has acknowledged receipt of this letter.
by letter dated October 14, 201913. The Litigation Chamber cannot therefore follow the defendant in

13 The Litigation Chamber did send this registered letter dated 30-09 to the defendant's business address.
Decision on the merits 53/2020 - 11/13
the statement that "I have never been asked or even advised to send in any
conclusions to the complainant. The registered letter of the Litigation Chamber also offered the following
the possibility for the defendant to ask for a copy of the file of exhibits, in which he could have reread
his own statements to ensure the consistency of his own defence, which he did not do.
34. 34. The defendant did not follow the procedure communicated to him by registered mail.
and by email. His response that he had not been informed of the obligation to send
conclusions to the complainant is contrary to the facts. The Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that by this
omission and erroneous denials of facts, the defendant did not provide full cooperation in the
procedure, which constitutes an aggravating circumstance.
35. In his reply to the form of reaction to a proposed fine, the defendant shall
argues mainly that the sending of this mail is the result of an error of its view of
handling. In this respect, the Litigation Chamber recalls that such a mistake of manipulation, the
if applicable, constitutes a security breach and as such a data breach within the meaning of Article
4.12 of the DP Regs that result in the defendant's liability for implementation
adequate safety measures to avoid such errors (see § 20 above). The
The Litigation Chamber notes, however, that there is no evidence in the file that the infringement would have been
committed deliberately, on the instructions of the defendant. The Litigation Chamber therefore holds that
the non-deliberate nature of the infringement as a mitigating circumstance.
36. The defendant's arguments do not change the fact that the personal data
of the complainant and of all persons included in the "permanence" file were unlawfully
processed, namely all persons calling on the mayor's secretariat (see above, §.
5).
37. Lastly, as regards the amount of the fine, the Litigation Chamber adopts the same criteria as for the
