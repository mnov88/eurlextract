## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant had sent him unsolicited commercial emails, and that such emails did not include the corresponding unsubscribing option.

### Dispute

The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have breached the prohibition of sending unsolicited commercial emails as per Article 21 LSSI: on the basis of the available evidences, the defendant sent a commercial email to the address of the claimant even after having confirmed him/her that his/her personal data have been deleted. Consequently, after considering some aggravating/mitigating circumstances \[(i) there is a negligence by the defendant, but (iii) the defendant has not obtained any advantages from such negligence nor the claimant has suffered any damages\], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 1,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine with two possible discounts: (i) acknowledging of its liability (800 €) and early voluntary payment (600 €). The defendant agreed to both concepts, so it paid 600 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.
