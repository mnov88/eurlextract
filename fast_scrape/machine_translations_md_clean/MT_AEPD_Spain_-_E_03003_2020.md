       Admin passwords are changed twice again
       consecutive as an additional precautionary measure.

       No anomalous accesses or generation of fraudulent users are detected.
     On Tuesday, February 11, users are again obliged to change their

        password.
     On Wednesday, February 12, they proceed to notify the AEPD of the gap in
