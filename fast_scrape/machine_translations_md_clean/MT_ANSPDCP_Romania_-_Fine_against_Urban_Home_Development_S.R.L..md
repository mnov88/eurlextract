## English Summary

### Facts

The controller did not display the name and identity of the controller responsible for processing the personal data on its website. Cookies, which were not technically necessary for the functioning of the website, were also installed on the data subjects’ device before they could give consent.

### Holding

First, [Article 13(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#1a "Article 13 GDPR") establishes that when the controller collects personal data from the data subject, it must inform the data subject of the identity and contact details of the controller. In the present case, the DPA discovered that the controller did not display the name and identity of the controller. Therefore, the DPA found a breach of [Article 13(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#1a "Article 13 GDPR").

Second, [Article 4(5) of the Legea nr. 506/2004 ('Law 506/2004')](https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/56973), storing or obtaining access to information stored on a user’s terminal equipment is only permitted if the user has been provided with clear and complete information before giving consent. The DPA considered that the controller installed cookies on the data subject’s device before the latter gave consent. Therefore, the DPA found a breach of [Article 4(5) of Law 506/2004](https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/56973).

The DPA therefore issued a €2,010 (RON 10,000) fine against the controller. The DPA also ordered the controller to complete its privacy policy with the necessary information provided for in [Article 13(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#1a "Article 13 GDPR") and reconfigure the way cookies are installed on the users’ devices in order to comply with [Article 4(5) Law 506/2004](https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/56973).

## Comment

[Legea nr. 506/2004](https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/56973) is a national Romanian law which implements the [ePrivacy directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02002L0058-20091219) into national law.

Another fine for GDPR violation

 

The National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the company Urban Home Development S.R.L. and found that it violated the provisions of art. 13 para. (1) lit. a) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (RGPD) and of art. 4 para. (5) lit. a) from Law no. 506/2004 on the processing of personal data and the protection of private life in the electronic communications sector.

The operator was penalized with a fine of 10,000 lei, for violating the provisions of art. 4 para. (5) lit. a) from Law no. 506/2004 and with a warning for violating the provisions of art. 13 para. (1) lit. a) GDPR.

The investigation was carried out as a result of a notification that signaled a possible violation of the legal provisions regarding the processing of personal data, as the operator's website did not display the information regarding the rights of the persons concerned according to the RGPD, nor the information regarding the use of cookies.

During the investigation, the National Supervisory Authority noted that the operator URBAN HOME DEVELOPMENT S.R.L. violated the provisions of art. 13 para. (1) lit. a) from the RGPD as it does not display on its website information regarding the name/identity of the operator responsible for the processing of personal data.

It was also found that by accessing the website managed by URBAN HOME DEVELOPMENT S.R.L., cookie modules were installed on the user's device before the consent was granted and which were not technically necessary for the operation of the website.

Thus, the operator stored cookie module type information in violation of the provisions of art. 4 para. (5) lit. a) from Law no. 506/2004.

At the same time, the following corrective measures were ordered against the operator:

to complete the privacy policy on the website with the necessary information provided by art. 13 para. (1) lit. a) from GDPR; to reconfigure the way of installing cookies modules on the devices of website users.
