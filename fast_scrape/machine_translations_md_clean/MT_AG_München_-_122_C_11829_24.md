## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject is a user of the platform www.facebook.com provided by Facebook (now Meta), the controller. Facebook uses personalised advertising that is tailored to the online behaviour of network users.

  
When the GDPR came into force, Facebook initially processed personal data for the placement of personalised advertising under the legal basis of [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR"), performance of a contract. From April 2023, Facebook changed the legal basis to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, legitimate interest.

  
Since November 2023, Facebook started implementing the pay or ok model, where users could choose to either consent to the use of their data for personalised advertising on its platforms or pay a subscription fee to prevent the processing. The data subject consented to the processing of his personal data for targeted advertising.

  
In January 2024, the data subject demanded out-of-court compensation and deletion or restriction of his personal data due to unlawful processing of his personal data but he received no answer.

  
The data subject filed a case before the Munich District Court (Amtsgericht München - AG München) claiming that Facebook processed his personal data unlawfully, in violation of [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR") because the processing was not necessary for the performance of the contract or to protect legitimate interests and he did not consent to the processing before November 2023.

  
The data subject claimed that he was entitled to immaterial damages in the amount of €1,000 because receiving targeted advertising was unpleasant and frightening to him. He further demanded that Facebook would provide him with his personal data regarding his online behaviour collected before he consented to the processing in 2023, delete the data if it is processed exclusively for advertising purposes and restrict processing to purposes other than advertising, insofar as the data are necessary for platform use.

### Holding

First, the court held that the data subject had no claim against Facebook for non-material damages under [Article 82(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#1 "Article 82 GDPR") because he did not present and prove concrete damage. It stated that the mere infringement of the provisions of the GDPR is not sufficient to justify a claim for damages. The court held that the impairments presented by the data subject were not sufficient to justify a claim for damages for pain and suffering.

  

Second, insofar as the data subject requests Facebook to delete the data that is processed exclusively for advertising purposes, this is precluded by the fact that the Facebook can and does process the personal data that it has used for the placement of personalised advertising for other permissible purposes. Data that is processed solely for advertising purposes therefore does not remain with Facebook.

Third, the requested restriction of the use of personal data to processing purposes other than advertising purposes is precluded by the data subject’s consent to further use, as the data subject has thus also consented to the continued use of the information from his account.

  
Consequently, the court ruled that the case was unfounded.

Order

The value in dispute is set at €4,500.00.
Facts

The plaintiff asserts claims against the defendant for damages, deletion, and restriction of processing to purposes other than advertising, insofar as the data is necessary for platform use, due to alleged violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The defendant is the operator of the website www.facebook.com and the services on this site for users in the European Union (hereinafter: Facebook). The plaintiff has been using the defendant's services for several years and is a registered user on Facebook under the email address ....

The online network serves users to connect with each other, maintain and establish contact with friends, and meet new people, groups, companies, organizations, etc. Users also receive a platform through which they can exchange ideas and share their experiences and opinions.

The defendant finances itself, among other things, with advertising revenue generated from the placement of personalized advertisements tailored to the users' usage behavior.

When registering with Facebook, the prospective user provides their first and last name, date of birth, and gender. They are also asked to provide their mobile phone number or email address.

The registration page also contains the following statement: "By clicking "Register," you agree to our Terms of Use. Our Data Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your data."

Both the Terms of Use and the Data Policy were linked on the registration form and accessible before the registration process was completed (see page 16 of the statement of defense = page 48 of the file, Exhibit B 6 for the registration form). In the Help section and the Data Policy, Facebook users are informed that they can use controls to make their accounts more secure, set their advertising preferences, view or download their Facebook data, or delete their account at any time (see pages 18/19 of the statement of defense = pages 50/51 of the file, Exhibit B 9). The plaintiff agreed to these Terms of Use. Upon the entry into force of the GDPR, the defendant initially informed its users that the processing of personal data for the purpose of displaying personalized advertising was based on Art. 6 (1b) GDPR, as it was necessary for the performance of the contract (Exhibit B 13). Since April 5, 2023, the defendant informed its users that data processing was based on Art. 6 (1f) GDPR and offered users the opportunity to object to data processing (Exhibit B 14, 15).

The defendant began introducing the consent model in Europe on November 3, 2023. Users were prompted via internal product notices to either (i) consent to the defendant's use of their data for advertisements on Facebook/Instagram or (ii) subscribe to the ad-free Facebook/Instagram version. In the latter case, the defendant does not use user data for advertising. Finally, users are free to choose neither option and instead leave Facebook. The privacy policy was updated accordingly, and a consent form was generated (Exhibit B 18).

The plaintiff has granted this consent to the effect that the defendant may continue to use the plaintiff's information for advertising purposes.

In a letter dated January 18, 2024 (Exhibit KGR 4), the plaintiff demanded out-of-court damages and the deletion or restriction of the plaintiff's personal data, as well as reimbursement of out-of-court legal fees. The defendant did not respond.

The plaintiff claims that the defendant violated the provisions of the GDPR by using the plaintiff's personal data. The defendant used the plaintiff's personal data without justification to serve personalized advertising. In particular, the personalization of advertising is neither necessary for the performance of the contract nor required to protect the legitimate interests of the defendant or third parties.

Furthermore, the plaintiff did not consent to the corresponding data processing before November 6, 2023. At no point during their contractual relationship did the defendant openly ask the plaintiff whether they consented to the delivery of personalized advertising. The programming of the user interface of the defendant's services never provided for a yes or no option. Rather, the defendant deliberately created an asymmetrical legal relationship by declaring personalized advertising, which was not in the plaintiff's interest, to be a service provided to the plaintiff in its terms of use, in order to circumvent the provisions of the GDPR.

Against this background, the plaintiff is entitled to damages in the amount of €1,000.00. This amount arises from the disadvantages suffered as a result of the unlawful data processing. In this respect, the plaintiff only later realized how unpleasant it was to look at something and then see personalized advertising on the same topic on the next page. Furthermore, the plaintiff is shocked by everything that is tracked and what content then reappears.

The plaintiff has a claim under Art. 82 GDPR against the defendant for violation of Art. 5 (1) (a) GDPR and due to the lack of consent under Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.

The plaintiff requests:

1. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff non-pecuniary damages, the amount of which is left to the discretion of the court, but should not be less than €1,000.00, plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the base interest rate since the commencement of proceedings.

2. The defendant is ordered to delete the personal data collected between May 25, 2018, and November 2, 2023, relating to the plaintiff's usage behavior:

a. to delete the data if it is processed exclusively for advertising purposes,

b. to restrict processing to purposes other than advertising if the data is necessary for platform use.

It is further requested that the defendant be ordered to indemnify the plaintiff's legal representatives for pre-trial legal fees in the amount of €540.50, plus interest from the date of commencement of proceedings at a rate of 5 percentage points above the base interest rate.

The defendant requests dismissal of the action.

The defendant is of the opinion that the claim under item 2) lacks the specificity required under Section 253 (2) No. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO). It is an alternative claim, which is inadmissible under Section 253 (2) No. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) due to a lack of specificity. There is no claim for damages, since no violations of the GDPR have occurred. No actual compensable damage has been demonstrated. The claim for erasure is unfounded, especially since the plaintiff consented to the processing in dispute.

For further details of the facts and issues in dispute, reference is made in full to the file, in particular to the written submissions exchanged, including the attachments, and – with regard to the plaintiff's hearing – to the minutes of the oral hearing of November 7, 2024 (pages 165 et seq. of the file).
Reasons

The action is unsuccessful.

A.

The admissible action is unfounded.

I. Claim 1) – Damages

The plaintiff is not entitled to non-material damages against the defendant in the amount of at least €1,050 under Article 82 (1) GDPR and under Sections 823 (2) in conjunction with Article 2 of the Basic Law (GG), Section 1004 of the German Civil Code (BGB), and Articles 13 et seq. of the GDPR.

In this respect, there is no (non-material) damage based on such a violation.

Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of a breach of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor pursuant to Article 82(1) GDPR.

1. The dispute over whether the data protection violation as such is sufficient to give rise to a claim for damages or whether it is also necessary to demonstrate and prove specific (also: immaterial) damage (for the sufficiency of the interference with the general right of personality: e.g. Higher Regional Court of Munich, judgment of 4 February 2019 - 15 U 3688/18 -, juris, para. 19 et seq., Ehmann/Selmayr/Nemitz, General Data Protection Regulation, 2nd ed., Art. 82 GDPR paras. 11-13; for the requirement of proven damage, e.g. Higher Labor Court of Baden-Württemberg...-2021, 17 Sa 37/20, cited according to juris, para. 96, Regional Court of Karlsruhe, judgment of ... cited according to juris, para. 19, Ernst, juris PR-ITR 1/2021 Note 6 in a judgment of the Darmstadt Regional Court of May 26, 2020, 13 O 244/19, with further references, which has been appealed, has now been decided by the ECJ in its judgment of May 4, 2023 (Case C-300/21, juris).

Accordingly, Article 82 (1) GDPR is to be interpreted as meaning that a mere violation of the provisions of this Regulation is not sufficient to give rise to a claim for damages. Firstly, it is clear from the wording of this provision that the existence of "damage" is one of the prerequisites for the claim for damages provided for in this provision, as is the existence of a violation of the GDPR and a causal link between the damage and the violation, with these three prerequisites being cumulative. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that every "breach" of the provisions of the GDPR, in itself, gives rise to a claim for damages for the data subject within the meaning of Article 4(1) of that regulation. Such an interpretation would run counter to the wording of Article 82(1) GDPR. Secondly, it should be emphasized that the separate mention of "damage" and "breach" in Article 82(1) GDPR would be superfluous if the EU legislature had assumed that a breach of the provisions of the GDPR would, in itself, be sufficient in every case to give rise to a claim for damages. This interpretation is also confirmed by the explanations in recitals 75, 85, and 146 of the GDPR. On the one hand, Recital 146 of the GDPR, which specifically concerns the right to compensation provided for in Article 82(1) of that Regulation, refers in its first sentence to "harm caused to a data subject as a result of processing that is incompatible with this Regulation." On the other hand, Recitals 75 and 85 of the GDPR state that "the risks ... may arise from processing of personal data that may result in ... harm" and that "a personal data breach may result in ... harm," respectively.

This follows, first, that the occurrence of damage in the context of such processing is only potential; second, that a violation of the GDPR does not necessarily lead to damage; and third, that a causal link must exist between the violation in question and the damage suffered by the data subject in order to justify a claim for damages.

In light of all of the above, a mere violation of Art. 82 (1) GDPR is not sufficient to justify a claim for non-material damages. Rather, actual damage must be demonstrated and proven.

The further judgment of the ECJ of December 14, 2023 (C-340/21 – juris) does not change this legal finding (see, for example, the judgment of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm of December 21, 2023, 7 U 137/23 – juris). In this case, the ECJ stated that Article 82(1) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that a data subject fears that their personal data may be misused by third parties as a result of a breach of that regulation may constitute "non-material damage" within the meaning of that regulation. However, a person affected by such a breach must demonstrate that these consequences constitute non-material damage within the meaning of Article 82 GDPR. If a person claiming damages on this basis relies on the fear that their personal data will be misused in the future as a result of such a breach, the national court hearing the case must examine whether this fear can be considered well-founded in the specific circumstances and with regard to the data subject.

Furthermore, compensation for non-material damage should not be made dependent on a materiality threshold (cf. ECJ judgment of May 4, 2023 (Case C-300/21, loc. cit.). However, Article 82(1) GDPR should be interpreted as precluding a national provision or practice that makes compensation for non-material damage within the meaning of that provision dependent on the damage suffered by the data subject reaching a certain degree of materiality. However, this interpretation does not mean that a person affected by a breach of the GDPR that has had negative consequences for them is exempt from proving that these consequences constitute non-material damage within the meaning of Article 82 of that regulation.

Recitals 75 and 85 list some possible damages, including identity theft and damage to reputation, but also financial losses, loss of control over one's own data, and the creation of inadmissible personality profiling. Furthermore, Recital 75 also mentions the mere processing of a large amount of personal data of a large number of individuals. While the damage must be broadly defined, it must also be genuinely "suffered" (Recital 146, p. 6), i.e., "appreciable," objectively comprehensible, and of a certain weight, in order to exclude mere inconvenience (cf. Regional Court of Essen, loc. cit.).

2. The court fully follows this case law. According to the principles outlined, the plaintiff has not demonstrated any noticeable impairment of personal interests caused by the personalized advertising sent to him by the defendant.

The impairments alleged by the plaintiff are not sufficient to justify a claim for damages.

To the extent that the plaintiff states that it fears that the data collected about it by the defendant will be passed on to third-party advertisers, this does not give rise to a claim for damages. This is true simply because the defendant's behavior feared by the plaintiff has not been implemented. It is undisputed between the parties that the defendant does not share any customizable user data with advertisers. The mere – in fact, unfounded – notion of data sharing cannot justify damages due to the lack of any connection to any behavior attributable to the defendant.

The plaintiff's further statement that he only later realized how unpleasant it was to look at something and then see personalized advertising on the same topic on the next page, as well as his statement that he was shocked by everything being tracked and the content that then reappears, is not sufficient to prove any noticeable impairment to the plaintiff. Nothing relevant to compensation for pain and suffering can be derived from such general statements.

3. Furthermore, it can ultimately remain undecided whether national law is applicable alongside Article 82(1) GDPR, or whether national law is superseded by the European provisions of the GDPR (see, for example, Kühling/Buchner/Bergt, 4th ed. 2024, GDPR Article 82, para. 67). Even assuming a coexistence, the plaintiff has no claim for damages against the defendant due to the lack of restitutionable damage, neither under Sections 280(1) and 253(2) of the German Civil Code (BGB) nor under any other national damages provision (see Aachen Regional Court, judgment of February 10, 2023 – 8 O 177/22, GRUR-RS 2023, 2621, para. 87). Reference is made to the above statements.

II. Claim 2) – Claim for Deletion and Restriction of Use

To the extent that the plaintiff requests that the defendant delete data processed exclusively for advertising purposes, this is contradicted by the fact that, according to uncontested statements, the defendant can and does process the personal data it used to place personalized advertising for other permissible purposes. Data processed solely for advertising purposes therefore does not remain with the defendant.

The requested restriction of the use of personal data to processing purposes other than advertising is contradicted by the plaintiff's consent to further use, because the plaintiff has thereby also consented to the continued use of the information from his account.

III. Claim 3) – Attorney's Fees

In the absence of a primary claim, there is also no claim for exemption from pre-trial attorney's fees.

C.

The decision on costs is based on Section 91 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO).

D.

The ruling on provisional enforceability is governed by Section 708 No. 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
