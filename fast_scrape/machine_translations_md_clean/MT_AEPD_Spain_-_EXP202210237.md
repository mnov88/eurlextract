## English Summary

### Facts

On 9 August 2019, the data subject lodged a complaint with the police regarding the theft of their wallet. On 20 August 2019, someone purchased a vehicle with the data subject's ID. On 20 January 2020, the vehicle was reported for driving without the compulsory insurance. As a consequence, Dirección General de Tráfico (national traffic department, also known as DGT) (the controller) notified the previous owner the start of the sanctioning procedure. On 31 January 2020, the new owner (with the documentation of the data subject) filed for the change of ownership with the controller. In August 2020, the data subject received a traffic ticket related to the lack of compulsory insurance. On 13 August 2020, the data subject lodged a new complaint with the police, stating that someone had tried to register a car under their name and that they had received notification of a traffic offence.

The data subject submitted a complaint to the Spanish DPA stating that the controller did not carry out any checks to validate the change of ownership, allowing the change despite the existence of an outstanding debt on the vehicle. They also alleged that the controller processed their data without a legitimate basis.

### Holding

The DPA held that there was a legal basis to process the data: the documentation was required under the General Vehicle Regulation for the notification of the sale of the vehicle ([Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR")), and, the entry in the vehicle register was made in the performance of a contract to which the data subject was a party ([Article (6)(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR")).

The DPA also found no lack of diligence on part of the controller in verifying the identity of the data subject, since the General Vehicle Regulation did not require verification or comparison of signatures, and the traffic official did not have the capacity or possibility to verify them.

## Comment

The fact that the processing of the controller relied on [Article (6)(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and [Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") as legal basis affects the holding of the DPA since in [PS/00126/2021](/index.php?title=AEPD_\(Spain\)_-_PS/00126/2021 "AEPD (Spain) - PS/00126/2021") the Spanish DPA held: "_if there is a fraudulent contracting of a product and the consent to perfect such contract has been given by a person other than the data subject (impersonation), we cannot understand that there is contractual consent on the part of the latter, who is harmed. In legal terms, we can consider that in this situation of fraud the legal business would not have been perfected, which would determine the inexistence of legitimacy to process the personal data of the data subject. This is because, once the contract has been signed, the legal basis for the processing that legitimizes the contractor as data controller to process the personal data of the data subject in a product contract would be the one provided for in art. 6.1.b) of the GDPR._"

LOPDGDD, the claim presented by the claimant party was admitted for processing.

                            FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                            II

Article 6 of the GDPR, Lawfulness of the treatment, establishes in point 1 that:

       "1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/10

 On the other hand, article 4 of the GDPR, Definitions, in its sections 1, 2 and 11,
notes that:

       “1) “personal data” means any information about an identified natural person
       or identifiable ("the data subject"); Any identifiable natural person shall be considered
       person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in

       elements of physical, physiological, genetic, psychological,

       economic, cultural or social of said person; “

In the present case, the DGT, as data controller, processed

the personal data of the claiming party, by registering their name in the Registry
General de Vehículos a vehicle, although it cannot be affirmed that said treatment is
carried out without legitimacy for it, as claimed by the claimant, since,
as established by Royal Decree 2822/1998, of December 23, by which
approves the General Regulation of Vehicles in its article 32:

       "1. Any natural or legal person who owns a vehicle registered

       section 2.c and 28, section 2 of this Regulation, for the registration of
       Vehicles will be accompanied by the following documents:

       provide at the time of submitting your application, provided they are
       duly collated by the records of the bodies in which the
       submitted the corresponding application, in accordance with the provisions of the

       Article 38.4 a) and b) of Law 30/1992, of November 26, on the
       Legal of Public Administrations and Administrative Procedure
       Common, without prejudice to the possibility of exercising this function by

       Municipal, will be signed by the Head of the Agency or Entity to which
       belongs to the vehicle or person to whom it delegates, accompanied by the
       required documentation."

Bearing in mind that the Provincial Traffic Headquarters of Valencia presented
a request for notification of sale of the vehicle, which was accompanied by the

documentation required in the General Vehicle Regulations to carry out said
procedure, including a sales contract where the seller is identified
and the buyer, it cannot be affirmed that the DGT has incurred in an illegitimate treatment
of data of the claimant, since the registration in the Vehicle Registry
is carried out in compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the
treatment, and, likewise, based on the execution of a contract in which the

interested is part.

                                          II

The complaining party adds that the DGT did not act with due diligence as it had not
verified if the identification of the complaining party was correctly carried out.
However, having analyzed in the previous section the articles of the Regulation of

Vehicles applicable to the notification of sale, it must be concluded that, in the notification
of sale, the aforementioned legal text does not require verification and collation of signatures, given
also note that it is not necessary for the buyer and the seller to meet
at the same time at the Traffic Headquarters, since according to Annex XIV of the
aforementioned Regulation, with regard to the figure of the acquirer:

       "B) Obligations of the purchaser:
       In accordance with the provisions of article 32, section 3 of this Regulation,
       the purchaser of a vehicle must, within thirty days from the date

       in which the identity and address of the transferor and acquirer is stated.
