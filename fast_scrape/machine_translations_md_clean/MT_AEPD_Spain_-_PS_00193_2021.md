## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant noticed a Vodafone charge on his bank account for the use of two mobile phone line. As he had not entered into any contracts with the company, he complained to the Police in Seville and the Consumers and Users Organisation.

The company investigated the charges once they received the complaint. It found them to be fraudulent and disconnected the lines. It also cancelled the complainant's existing debt in its systems.

### Holding

The AEPD held that the complainant's personal data were "_incorporated into the company's information systems, without him having accredited that he had legitimately contracted, had legitimacy for the collection and subsequent processing of his personal data, or that there was any other cause that would make the processing carried out lawful_".

It argued Vodafone Spain failed to perform the required due diligence to verify the contracting party was who they claimed to be, notably because the fraudulent contract that was established was unsigned and contained incorrect information (e.g. address, date of birth).

It then assessed the degree of responsibility that should be attributed to Vodafone Spain for this breach, and found a clear link between the company's business practices and the breach. It nonetheless took into account that the company reacted with the necessary urgency to remedy the incident as a mitigating factor.

Therefore, it fined the company €50,000.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

                                            II

       The facts presented may suppose on the part of the claimed party, the

commission of an infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD that establishes the assumptions that
allow the processing of personal data to be considered lawful.

       Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it complies with at least one of the following
terms:
      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the

      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;
      (…) "

      The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for

the imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)

2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that one and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)

        a) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
           conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
           Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the

claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it processed the
personal data of the complaining party without having any legitimacy to
it.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/10

       The personal data of the complaining party were incorporated into the systems
of company information, without having proven that he had contracted
legitimately, had legitimacy for the collection and subsequent treatment of

your personal data, or there is any other cause that would make the treatment lawful
effected.

       Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, it remains in
questioned the diligence used by the respondent to identify the
person who carried out the contract on behalf of the complaining party.

       Well, it is proven as recognized by the claimed party in its
written reply to this Agency dated May 14, 2021, which was produced
a fraudulent hiring.

       It should be noted that the contracts provided by the claimed party as
document number 4, they appear unsigned and their data (address, date
of birth), do not coincide with the identity card of the claimant.

       Likewise, it appears that the Sepa Order of domiciliation is not signed.

       Thus, the claimed party did not verify the personality of the alleged contractor, not
took the necessary precautions so that these events did not occur.

       In accordance with the evidence available at this time

procedural and without prejudice to what results from the instruction of the procedure, it is estimated
that the conduct of the complained party could violate article 6.1 of the RGPD
being able to be constitutive of the offense typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned
Regulation 2016/679.

        Ultimately, the respondent has not provided a document or evidence
any evidence that the entity, in such a situation, had deployed the
minimum diligence required to verify that indeed your interlocutor was the one
claimed to flaunt.

       Respect for the principle of legality that is at the core of fundamental right

protection of personal data requires that it be proven that the
responsible for the treatment deployed the necessary diligence to prove that
extreme. If this Agency does not act like this - and if this Agency does not demand it, it is incumbent upon
for compliance with the regulations governing the right to data protection of
personal character - the result would be to empty the principle of legality of content.

      In this sense, Recital 40 of the RGPD states:

      "(40) For the treatment to be lawful, personal data must be processed

with the consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established
in accordance with Law, either in this Regulation or by virtue of another Law
of the Union or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation,
including the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/10

treatment or the need to perform a contract to which the interested party or
in order to take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the
conclusion of a contract. "

                                                III

respectively, provide the following:
    "1. Each supervisory authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
