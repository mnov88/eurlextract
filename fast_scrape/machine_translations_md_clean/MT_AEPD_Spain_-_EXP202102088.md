## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA regarding the website of a football club. The DPA's investigation confirmed that controller's website required users to fill in forms with personal data but did not have a privacy policy.

### Holding

The DPA reiterated that when personal data are collected, there must be accompanying disclosures per [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"), including identifying the means and purposes of processing, the identity and contact details of the controller, and the existence of data subjects' rights under the GDPR.

The DPA considered as mitigating factors that (a) the controller was a small company (b) had not profited from its violations, and (c) had no prior violations; it therefore assessed a fine of €3,000 and ordered an appropriate privacy policy be added to the controller's website.
