## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject submitted a complaint to the AEPD stating that the defendant had sent an email containing an accusation of attempted fraud, letter of dismissal, and severance pay of the claimant, to a third party without the their authorisation. This information as well as the response from the third party to the email received, became known to the data subject when appearing before the Court of First Instance of Solares (Cantabria) following a report the defendant made to the Local Police of Santander for theft of tools. The third party upon receiving said documents responded stating the following:

“… We believe that the accompanying documentation, particularly the letter of dismissal and the corresponding severance pay, should not have sent to us as it contains personal data ...”

The AEPD sent a request for information to the defendant but they did not respond. The AEPD admitted the data subject's complaint in accordance with Article 65 LOPDGDD and decided to initiate a sanctioning procedure in accordance with Article 83(5)(a) GDPR against the defendant for alleged infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

### Dispute

Does the action of the defendant constitute a violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR")?

### Holding

Considering the evidence available, the AEPD held that the action of the defendant violated the principle of confidentiality established in Article 5 (1)(f) GDPR by sending an email containing the data subject's personal data without authorisation for doing so, and decided to impose a fine of €10,000 on the defendant.

The fine imposed falls within the criteria stated in Article 83(5)(a) GDPR. In imposing the fine, the AEPD factored in accordance with Article 83(2) GDPR and Article 76 LOPDGDD the following points:

*   The local scope of processing concerned by the defendant
*   The volume of data subject affected. In this instance, only one person was affected.
*   There is no evidence of actions taken by the defendant to mitigate the damage suffered by the affected data subject and to prevent recurrence as the defendant did not respond to the request of information made by the AEPD, this also reveals the absence of cooperation of the defendant with the supervisory authority, in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate its possible adverse effects.
*   There is no evidence that the defendant acted intentionally, however, it is evident that the actions constitute a high degree of negligence.
*   The defendant is a small-sized company.

  

## Comment

It would have been interesting to know if the defendant provided the data subject with a copy of its Privacy Notice and whether the categories of the data disclosed, the name of the third party, and the legal basis for sending personal data to the third party were included in it.

       instead of the measures mentioned in this section, according to the

       circumstances of each particular case;
       (…) "

       In the first place, the treatment of the claimed person could constitute a
violation of article 5, Principles relating to treatment, of the RGPD that establishes

what:

       "1. The personal data will be:

       (…)
       f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security for the

       personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or
       illicit and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application
       appropriate technical or organizational measures ('integrity and
       confidentiality »)”.
       (…)

       Article 5, Duty of confidentiality, of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights
(hereinafter LOPDGDD), states that:

       "1. Those responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all
people who intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of

       2. The general obligation indicated in the previous section will be complementary
of the duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

       3. The obligations established in the previous sections will be maintained

treatment ”.

                                           IV
       The documentation in the file shows that the defendant
violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles relating to treatment, in relation to the
Article 5 of the LOPGDD, duty of confidentiality, when sending an email to
a third party, containing the dismissal and termination document, revealing your

personal character and being accessible to third parties without their authorization.

       This duty of confidentiality, previously the duty of secrecy, must
It is understood that its purpose is to prevent leaks of data not

       Therefore, this duty of confidentiality is an obligation incumbent upon not

opting for the highest amount ”.

       On the other hand, the LOPDGDD, for prescription purposes, in its article 72 indicates:
“Violations considered very serious:

       1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

       a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
       established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
       (…) "

                                           SAW

       In order to establish the administrative fine to be imposed, they must
observe the provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, which
point out:

       "1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of fines

        treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
        applied by virtue of articles 25 and 32;
        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
        treatment;
        f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to
        remedy the violation and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the violation;

        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement, in
        particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such case,
        what extent;
        i) when the measures indicated in Article 58 (2) have been

        previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
        case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct

        or indirectly, through infringement.

        In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its
Article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes that:

        "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 may also be taken into account:

        a) The continuing nature of the offense.

        f) Affecting the rights of minors.
        g) To have, when not mandatory, a delegate for the protection of
data.
        h) The submission by the person in charge or in charge, with character
        voluntary, to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, in those

        cases in which there are controversies between those and any
        interested."

        In accordance with the transcribed precepts, in order to set the amount of the
sanction of a fine to be imposed in the present case for the offense typified in the

Article 83.5.a) of the RGPD for which the claimed person is responsible, in an assessment
initial, the following factors are considered concurrent:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/8

       The scope in a local environment of the treatment carried out by the entity
       claimed.

       The number of affected is limited to a single person, the claimant.

       The measures taken by the defendant to avoid being
       produce similar incidents, since before the information request
       the Agency has not responded to it, which in turn affects the absence
       of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the

       infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the same.

       There is no evidence that the entity acted maliciously, although
       the performance reveals a serious lack of diligence.

       The claimed entity is a small business.

       Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and the criteria of
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

       The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection RESOLVES:
