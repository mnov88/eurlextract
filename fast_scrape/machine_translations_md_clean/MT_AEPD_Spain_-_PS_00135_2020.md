## English Summary

### Facts

The gym center had already been required by the Spanish DPA to make the necessary adjustments in its contracts to respect the GDPR requirements. One year and 5 months after the Madrid City Council's Health Services Bureau required the entity, twice, to modify the abusive clauses contrary to data protection regulations and 8 months after this Agency first requested their modification, the entity started to proceed to modify the contracts. Some old clauses in breach of the GDPR were still active.

### Dispute

### Holding

The Spanish DPA imposed a fine of EUR 5000 on the gym for the omission of the duty to inform the affected person about the treatment of their personal data in accordance with Article 13 GDPR. The center paid EUR 3000; the reduction was given because of voluntary payment and acknowledging the facts (after waiving a further appeal against the DPA's decision).

It should be noted that on November 5, 2019, we held a meeting with

implementation process has been slower than projected.
We have been asked to provide copies of the latest contracts from September 2019 and so

In the present case, it should be noted that, prior to the opening
of the present sanctioning file (PS/135/2020), had been previously processed
an investigative file for the same facts, in this Agency,
(E/0065/2019), during which time the entity in question was transferred for analysis and response. It was also requested to inform
of the measures they would take to avoid similar situations in the future.
The process of all the proceedings in the two cases has been as follows:
1.- On 16/04/18 and 09/05/18, the Technical Services for Quality and Consumption of the
The Madrid City Council made inspection visits to the complained entity, detecting a series of irregularities in the clauses of the contract that they were making with the clients and that were in breach of data protection regulations.
2.- On 26/11/18, the Technical Services of Quality and Consumption of the Madrid City Council notified this Agency of the facts detected in these inspections.

3.- On 09/01/19, this Agency requested the entity in question
information on the reported events.
4.- On 22/02/19, the entity complained of affirms that they had already modified the
Unfair terms in the contract with customers, in particular terms that have been denounced for not being adapted to the new RGPD (the ninth, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth).
5.- On 01/03/19, this Agency closed the preliminary investigation proceedings (E/0065/2019), considering that the request had been correctly dealt with.
On 26 September 19, this Agency received a new complaint from
of the Technical Services for Quality and Consumption of the Madrid City Council, indicating that in the last inspections carried out on the issued company, there had been
to check again that it continues to issue the same biased contract.
7.- On 24/10/19, this fact was transferred to the entity in question so that
to proceed with its analysis and to respond to this Agency.
On 26/11/19, this Agency received a written statement of allegations, submitted
by the entity in question, claiming that:
- In relation to the old contracts, already existing until February
2019, the clauses denounced were eliminated and a new
writing them. But its adaptation had not been completed in its entirety, since, as it was carried out in person, and due to the large number of members distributed among the 20 gyms that the entity has in the Community of Madrid, many of whom do not attend the centers regularly, this process was taking a long time.
In the contracts signed from February 2019 to October 2019, the entity claims that "they did not meet the requirements because the
operating software installed on the entity's computer network has not been

receipt of the second request by this Agency.
- For contracts signed from November 2019 onwards, the following is provided
A copy of the same, being able to verify the modification of the denounced clauses and their adaptation to the new RGPD.
It is noted that the complained entity became aware of the irregularities in its contracts with customers in April/May 2018, through the minutes of
The inspection was carried out by the Madrid City Council's Health Services Department, which was also required to remedy the deficiencies and adapt the
terms that are abusive to current data protection regulations.
Later, in February 2019, this Agency required him to remedy
the irregularities detected. On that occasion, the claimed entity stated that,
He responded to the injunction and proceeded to eliminate the unfair terms reported and to
to draft new ones in accordance with the RGPD, but it is not until November
2019, after having received the second request from this Agency, (the
24/10/19), when, according to the entity, the new contracts are definitively implemented.
Consequently, one year and 5 months after the Madrid City Council's Health Services Department required the entity, twice, to modify the abusive clauses contrary to data protection regulations and 8 months
After this Agency first requested their modification, the entity complained of, proceeds to modify the contracts. If we add to this the fact that many of the old contracts, made before November 2019, with the old clauses are still active, the facts denounced are clearly contrary to those stipulated in the RGPD.
