## English Summary

### Facts

A resident has installed, without the authorization of the Comunidad de Propietarios ("Community of Property Owners"), video surveillance cameras oriented to common areas of said Community/neighborhood, with signs of video surveillance area without information of the data controller, the purpose of the system and the proper address for the exercise of data subject's rights.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA highlighted that in order to install cameras in common areas, it is necessary to have the authorization of the Neighbors Council, the request must be presented in the corresponding agenda of the Council's meeting and the approval must follow the terms of the LPH (Horizontal Property Law).

AEPD also stated that cameras installed by private individuals must be oriented towards their private space, avoiding the capture of the private area of third parties.

In its conclusion, AEPD stated that there was no informative poster(s) with an effective address or information identifying the data controller and that in no case shall the use of surveillance practices be allowed beyond the surroundings of the installation and in particular, they may not affect surrounding public spaces, adjacent buildings and vehicles other than those accessing the monitored space.

Security cameras installed in private spaces may not obtain images of public spaces, since the security function of public spaces corresponds exclusively to the State Security Forces and Corps. Likewise, in the case of false cameras, they must be oriented towards a private area to avoid intimidation of adjacent neighbors who do not know whether or not they are processing personal data.

The Spanish DPA fined the resident €1,500 for installing a camera in a common area, without following the mandatory legal requirements to do so, violating [Article 6.1](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and [Article 13](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") GDPR.

       The evidence provided allows us to verify the irregularities described in the
claim, as well as the obvious misorientation of the device that affects areas
