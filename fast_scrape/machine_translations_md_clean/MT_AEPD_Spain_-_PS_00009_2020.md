## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant had sent him a message thanking the acquisition of a new phone line he/she did not recognize; after checking this point in the mobile app of the defendant, the claimant discovered that the defendant (acting through an agency) had unlawfully used his personal and banking details in order to produce a contract without his/her consent, as its commercial procedure is the following: the agency buys prepaid cards in the name of its clients in order to authorize portability to Vodafone.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests stating that the whole situation is due to an isolated behaviour of the agency, as the defendant, always following strict procedures, was fully convinced of the veracity of the portability contract (which was not signed, and in which the agency had included the personal data of the claimant without his/her consent), and so it has been “a victim” of the bad practices of the agency; the defendant also stated that there is no intentionality on its side, and that it totally rejects the behaviour of the agency, as such unlawful activity would be punished according to the commercial agreement between both companies. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have breached the lawfulness of processing principle as per article 6(1) GDPR: on the basis of the available evidences, the defendant did not take the due diligences to avoid such situation, and it did not prove the lawfulness of the data processing. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) there is a negligence/intentionality by the defendant, and (iii) basic personal data have been affected\], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 60,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine with a possible discount (48,000 €). The defendant agreed, so it paid 48,000 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.
