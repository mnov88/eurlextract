## English Summary

### Facts

The controller in this case is a car dealership that installed video surveillance cameras in its garage.

In the context of a broader investigation into video surveillance practices in the country ([see very similar case here](/index.php?title=CNPD_\(Luxembourg\)_-_D%C3%A9lib%C3%A9ration_n%C2%B0_47FR/2021 "CNPD (Luxembourg) - Délibération n° 47FR/2021")), the Luxembourg DPA inspected whether the car dealership had installed such cameras in its garage. Prior to this inspection, the company declared it did not use such cameras. However, the DPA visited the garage and found evidence of the contrary.

It therefore opened an investigation to determine whether these were lawfully installed.

### Holding

First, the Luxembourg DPA assessed whether the company complied with its information obligations under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). It started by affirming that only what is strictly necessary to achieve the pursued aims can be filmed, and that the processing operations cannot be disproportionate when assessed against their purpose. Companies seeking to lawfully install such systems are therefore required to set out the exact purposes of the processing prior to their installation.

During the investigation, the DPA found no information as to the existence of the video surveillance system had been provided by the car dealership. Additionally, the the employees were never notified of the existence of the video surveillance systems. The owner of the dealership argued they were not aware of the obligation to provide such information, and had only installed these to ensure customers would not have to wait if one of the receptionists were ever missing. The DPA nonetheless held the car dealership breached [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") by failing to provide information on the existence of the video surveillance systems.

Second, the DPA assessed whether the car dealership complied the principle of data minimisation per [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"). The dealership stated the images captured by the camera were not recorded, but simply transmitted onto a screen for the owner to check whether customers were dealt with in time when the reception was not occupied. The DPA's inspector found that the field of vision of the cameras essentially allowed the constant surveillance of employees working at the reception, which they held to be disproportionate as said employees could feel constantly observed. As such, the Luxembourg DPA held the car dealership contravened [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR") because the cameras could be replaced with less invasive means to achieve the purpose pursued, such as a counter which welcomes customers.

Thus, the Luxembourg DPA held that the company (1) failed to comply with the principle of data minimisation by not limiting the field of vision of its video surveillance systems, and (2) failed to adequately inform its employees and third parties of their existence. It fined the dealership €1500 for these violations of the GDPR.
