an internet platform (SHOPIFY) specialized in making available to freelancers or new entrepreneurs models of websites to open up trade to the internet, and we assumed that this tool already provided all the
notices, models and warranties to serve the purpose for which it is offered.
In this way, and as we are assured on the platform itself, if there were secure payment systems that would guarantee the privacy and protection of the users' data
of the website and in fact, no breach or damage to any user has occurred. Even so, everything related to the payment platform has been improved by incorporating
other secure payment platforms and have been reviewed and implemented on the web all
the warnings and consents set out in the regulations.
Without prejudice to all this, and to the fact that we understand that the regulations on data protection are being complied with, this entity has commissioned an evaluation of
risks to a specialized company to carry out a diagnosis and propose
corrective measures where appropriate.
In any case, I would like to insist once again that it has been and is the will of this entity to act in accordance with data protection regulations, that we always trust in specialised entities in the sector and that there is a total predisposition to collaborate with the AEPD to guarantee the protection of our clientele's data and

In the present case, two aspects of the website \*\*\*URL.1.
On the other hand, in the privacy policy it still refers to the fulfillment of the Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on the Protection of Personal Data
(LOPD), and without having yet applied the new RGPD, which according to its Article 99, would enter
in force as of 25/05/18, it being noted that the claimed entity is NOT applying the provisions of Article 13 of the aforementioned RGPD, which establishes the information that must be provided to the interested party at the time of collection of its data
personal.
These facts constitute an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of Article 13 of the RGPD, since his website was not adapted to the RGPD and not
provide the user with the information set out therein, at the time of
collection of your personal data.
For its part, Article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of
the omission of the duty to inform the affected person about the treatment of
your personal data in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of the GPRS'.
This infringement is punishable by a fine of up to 20,000,000 euros or, in the case of a company, of up to 4 % of the total annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is the greater
higher amount, in accordance with Article 83.5(b) of the GPRS.

Also, no mechanism to reject all cookies.
These facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the defendant, for violation of Article 22.2 of the LSSI, according to which
"Service providers may use data storage and retrieval devices in the terminal equipment of the recipients, provided that the recipients have given their consent after the information has been provided
clear and complete on its use, in particular on the purposes of the processing of

of personal data protection.
Where technically possible and effective, the consent of the recipient to

appropriate browser or other applications.
The above shall not preclude possible storage or access of a technical nature to the
to effect the transmission of a communication over a communications network
electronic or, to the extent strictly necessary, for the provision of
an information society service expressly requested by the recipient".
This infringement is classified as "minor" in Article 38.4 g) of the aforementioned law, which
considers as such: "Use data storage and retrieval devices
when the information has not been provided or the consent of the recipient of the service has not been obtained under the terms required by Article 22.2.", and may be subject to a fine of up to 30,000 euros, in accordance with Article 39 of the aforementioned ISESA.
Following the evidence obtained in the preliminary investigation phase, it is considered that
The penalty to be imposed should be graduated according to the following criteria established in Article 40 of the ISSA:

the reported entity the determination of a system for obtaining informed consent that is consistent with the mandate of the ISSA.

In accordance with these criteria, it is considered appropriate to impose on the entity complained of
a penalty of EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros), for the infringement of Article 22(2) of
LSSI.
Therefore, in accordance with the above, by the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
