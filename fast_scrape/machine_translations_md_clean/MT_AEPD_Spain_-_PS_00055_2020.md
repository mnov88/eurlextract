## English Summary

### Facts

The controller's video surveillance system is oriented toward the public space. The complainant questions its lawfulness.

### Dispute

The complaint puts forward the idea that the personal data collected through the surveillance system is not adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and processed (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR).

In its defense, the controller makes the following points: (1) the surveillance system was meant to protect the company property after previous vandalism acts, (2) recordings are filtered in order to reduce their identification power, (3) data subjects are informed about ongoing surveillance through a warning. The controller also submitted a certificate by an external company ensuring that the surveillance system only points to the façade of the establishment.

### Holding

The AEPD accepts the arguments put forward by the controller and concludes that the processing does not infringe the data minimisation principle. In so doing, the EAPD considered different factors including the the presumption of innocence principle that can only be overcome by persuasive evidence. In this case, there was no such an evidence that the video surveillance system had recorded the public road. Therefore the Authority closed the procedure without imposing any fine.

In this sense, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment76/1990, of 04/26, considers that the right to the presumption of innocence involves:"That the sanction is based on acts or probative means of charge or incriminatingof the reproached conduct; that the burden of proof rests with the accuser, withoutthat no one is obliged to prove their own innocence; and that any insufficiency inthe result of the tests carried out, freely assessed by the bodysanctioning, must be translated into an acquittal.The presumption of innocence governs without exceptions in the Ordinancesanctioner and must be respected in the imposition of any sanction, whether criminalor administrative (TCo 13/1981), since the exercise of the sanctioning right inany of its manifestations, is conditioned to the game of the test and acontradictory procedure in which their own positions can be defended.In accordance with this principle, no sanction can be imposed by reason of theguilt of the accused if there is no probationary activity of the charge, which in theassessment of the authorities or bodies called to resolve, destroy thispresumption (TCo Auto 3-12-81).C / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es
