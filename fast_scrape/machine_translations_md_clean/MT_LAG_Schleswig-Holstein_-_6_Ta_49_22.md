## English Summary

### Facts

The controller operated a care service where the data subject was employed. The controller filmed the data subject in their work environment and published a thirty-six second video on Youtube for promotional purposes. The data subject had previously given verbal consent to the filming but had not received any further information about the purpose of the filming or their rights.

Later, the data subject objected to the use of the video and claimed €6,000 in damages during proceedings before the labour court. The controller deactivated the video immediately afterwards. The parties involved reached an agreement and settled the dispute.

The data subject had applied for legal aid for claiming damages up to €6,000. The ArbG Kiel granted it up to the amount of €2,000. Thereupon, the data subject then appealed to the LAG Schleswig-Holstein for legal aid in the amount of €6,000.

### Holding

The court upheld the original decision. The controller infringed the GDPR by filming the data subject and publishing the clip because the data subject had not given written consent and was not informed about the purpose of the data processing or their right to withdraw consent. The data subject is entitled for maximum damages of up to €2,000, but not €6,000 as requested.

The data subject does not have to prove that damage within the meaning of [Article 82(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#1 "Article 82 GDPR") has occurred, as a breach of the GDPR itself constitutes non-material damage. Recital 146, sentences 1 and 6 GDPR support this interpretation, as the claims for damages serve to support the objectives of the Regulation and in particular to provide effective protection of individuals’ rights.

The court confirmed that damages in this case can amount to a maximum of €2,000. The controller did not film the data subject in intimate situations or discriminate them and the data subject gave verbal consent to be filmed. Furthermore, the controller reduced the harm by taking the video down immediately after the data subject requested it. However, on the other hand, the controller was not only using photographs, but moving images for a commercial purpose.

The court found that damages of €6,000 would not be justified in these circumstances. In similar cases, even lower amounts than €2,000 were awarded, or the cases were more severe because the controller’s actions were discriminating.

Reasons:
I. The complainant (plaintiff and applicant) objects to the partial
wise denial of legal aid.
In the main, the parties argued about claims from a terminated work
employment relationship. Among other things, the plaintiff demanded payment of EUR 6,000.00 for pain and
money. This was based on the following facts:
The plaintiff had from 08.09. until December 31, 2021 in the nursing service of the defendant as a nursing
assistant worked. During this time, the defendant allowed a 36-second
shoot video. The plaintiff took part in the video shoot. She's in the video to-

processing and your right of withdrawal in text form. The defendant published
the video on the Internet on the platform "youtube".

Case a significantly higher compensation for pain and suffering.
The labor court did not remedy the complaint (non-remedial order dated
05/17/2022) and submitted the matter to the regional labor court for a decision.
II. The immediate appeal permitted under §§ 127 Paragraph 2, 569 ZPO is unfounded
de. The labor court has the sufficient prospect of success for the pain and suffering
rightly denied, insofar as the plaintiff demands payment of more than EUR 2,000.00
belongs.
1. The prospect of success within the meaning of § 114 ZPO is to be assumed
from the standards which, according to the case law of the Federal Constitutional
right apply. According to this, the examination of the prospect of success must not lead to the
legal prosecution itself in the ancillary proceedings of legal aid
stored, and to let this take the place of the main proceedings (cf.
e.g. B. BVerfG 30.04.2007 - 1 BvR 1323/05 -; BVerfG 15.10.2015 - 1 BvR 1790/13
– para. 19). Legal aid may therefore only be refused if a
follows in the main, although not absolutely impossible, the success
prospect is only a distant one (BVerfG 13.07.2005 - 1 BvR 175/05 -).
2. Measured against this, the labor court has met the requirements for the sufficient
corresponding prospects of success are not inadmissibly overstretched. It correctly recognized
that the summary examination based on the standard of § 114 para. 1 ZPO, whether
a specific compensation for pain and suffering appears appropriate or not,
the legal aid procedure can regularly only be limited to
whether the compensation sought is based on the specific circumstances
of the individual case within a reasonable framework. the
final check to what exact amount within this framework

aa) Due to the alleged violation of the defendant against the provisions
According to the GDPR, the plaintiff has suffered immaterial damage. Of the
Legal right to immaterial damages according to Art. 82 Para. 1 GDPR

Already the violation of the GDPR itself leads to an im-

which fully meets the objectives of the Regulation. Thieves-
The chamber of grievances, together with the labor court, assumes that in
