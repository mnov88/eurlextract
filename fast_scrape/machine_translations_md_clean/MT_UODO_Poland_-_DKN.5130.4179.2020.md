## English Summary

### Facts

McDonald’s Polska Sp. z o.o. (the controller) reported a personal data breach to the DPA in July 2020. The data breach involved personal data of employees stored in an unsecured database file that was publicly available. This meant that an unauthorised third party could access the file and (through appropriate software) gain insight into aspects such as an employee’s schedule and ID information. The controller determined that the data breach may result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the affected data subjects, and therefore informed said data subjects through its internal network. The communication also included instructions on checking whether a third party had used their ID information.

The DPA initiated proceedings against the controller in November 2020. The DPA expanded the scope of its investigations to include the processor entrusted by the controller with processing employee data.

During its investigations, the DPA found that neither the controller nor the processor assessed the effectiveness of their security measures on a regular basis. In addition, the controller did not verify the measures taken by the processor. The controller argued that it did not need to involve its Data Protection Officer (DPO) in ensuring security of processing, because the processing in that regard was completely outsourced to the processor.

### Holding

The DPA found a violation of [Article 24 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR "Article 24 GDPR"), 25 GDPR and 32(1) and (2) GDPR. The controller did not perform a risk assessment of processing employees’ ID information, and only started to implement a process of pseudonymisation after the data breach had occurred. Furthermore, outsourcing the processing to a processor does not exempt the controller from its obligations.

In addition, the DPA found a violation of [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 25(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#1 "Article 25 GDPR"). The controller did not limit the data processed to what was strictly necessary, as it processed employees’ ID information to identify them. This was unnecessary and generated a high risk for the employees.

The DPA fined the controller PLN 16,932,657 (€3,960,392) in total. The DPA stated that the obligation to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures applies to both the controller and processor. In addition, the DPA issued a warning to the controller for not notifying the employees directly.

## Comment

The processor also received a fine of PLN 183,858 (€43,242).

In its decision, the DPA also considered whether franchises of McDonald’s could be considered controllers. The DPA considered McDonald’s Polska a controller, as it owned the schedule module used to manage and record the employees’ working hours. Furthermore, it also selected the processor and managed the contracts between the, With this, the DPA decided that McDonald’s Polska met the definition of controller under [Article 4(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#7 "Article 4 GDPR").

The decision below is a machine translation of the Polish original. Please refer to the Polish original for more details.

```
The President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO), Mirosław Wróblewski, imposed fines totaling PLN 16,932,657 (PLN 1,632,063, PLN 13,600,528, PLN 1,700,066) on McDonald's Polska Sp. z o.o. and issued a warning for violating a number of personal data protection regulations. In the same case, the President of the UODO also imposed fines totaling PLN 183,858 (PLN 94,286, PLN 42,429, PLN 47,143) on 24/7 Communication Sp. z o.o. (the processor).

McDonald's Polska Sp. z o.o. entrusted the processing of the restaurant chain's employees' personal data to an external company for the purpose of managing work schedules. Failure to conduct a risk analysis of this process, implement appropriate security measures, and comply with the provisions of the personal data processing agreement led to the disclosure of personal data in a publicly accessible directory.

Circumstances of the incident

McDonald’s Polska Sp. z o.o. (hereinafter also referred to as McDonald’s or the controller) reported a personal data breach to the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO). The controller determined that a shared file in a public directory contained data on McDonald’s employees and its franchisees: first and last names, PESEL numbers, passport numbers (if no PESEL number was provided), McDonald’s restaurant number, start date and time of work, end date and time of work, number of hours worked, position, days off, type of day, and type of work.

Processing Agreement

McDonald’s entered into a data processing agreement with 24/7 Communication Sp. z o.o. (hereinafter referred to as 24/7 Communication or the processor) concluded a public relations services agreement (the main agreement), alongside which it concluded a personal data processing agreement, under which employee data collected in the "employee schedule module" was processed and made available to McDonald's restaurant employees, franchisees, and their employees via the website operated by the controller. The controller did not have the authority to manage the resources and configuration of the IT system containing the employee schedule module. Only the processor had such authority. The controller outsourced the entire process, including its operation, to the processor. The schedule module did not have a separate administrative panel, and although such access was possible, the controller never requested such access from the processor.

Simultaneously, the provisions of the personal data processing agreement, particularly regarding audits and inspections, were not implemented. The controller failed to exercise proper oversight over the entrusted personal data.

Negligence in Risk Analysis and Security Measures

During the proceedings, the supervisory authority noted that the obligation to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures applies to both the controller and the processor.

Implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures is not a one-time action, but a process in which the controller and processor conduct ongoing reviews and, if necessary, update previously adopted security measures.

The obligation to regularly test, measure, and evaluate was not expressly included in the data protection policy developed by the processor and was ultimately not implemented in any way. The processor also failed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of entrusted personal data processed using the employee rosters module, as it did not consider it a resource for which it was responsible. This obligation stems from the regulations and cannot be waived based on the interpretation of the provisions of the agreement concluded between the controller and the processor. At the same time, the personal data breach occurred due to incorrect server configuration, which allowed viewing of the server's content, including a copy of the database from the employee scheduling application containing personal data.

Neither the controller nor the processor conducted a risk analysis. Technical and organizational measures appropriate to the scale of processing were implemented. The breach resulted from an incorrect configuration of the server, which the processor was responsible for.

Failure to conclude a sub-processing agreement

When processing the entrusted personal data, the processor used the services of another entity with which it had not concluded a sub-processing agreement. Only after the breach occurred and during the supervisory authority's investigation was a relevant agreement signed, even though, in accordance with the GDPR (Article 28 paragraphs 4 and 9) and the concluded agreement, this obligation existed previously.

Furthermore, neither the controller nor the processor involved the data protection officer in all matters concerning personal data protection (Article 38 paragraph 1 of the GDPR). At McDonald's, the DPO was not involved in the analysis of the qualifications and validity of the processor's selection and in the processing of data related to the roster module. The DPO's omission limited the ability to prevent the breach.

Verification of the Processor

The investigation revealed that McDonald's did not verify the processor's ability to secure data – it relied solely on prior PR cooperation. This violated Article 28(1) of the GDPR, which requires that processing on behalf of the controller be carried out by processors that provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the rights of data subjects.

A data protection agreement does not release the controller from data protection obligations.

Entrusting the processing of personal data to a processor does not release the controller from the obligation to ensure security in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR (Article 24, Article 25, and Article 32, paragraphs 1 and 2).

The controller failed to conduct the required risk analysis and failed to consider the threats arising from using the processor's services.

If the scope of processing can be minimized, this should be done.

The controller should assess the scope of personal data processed to limit it to only the data necessary to achieve the purpose of data processing, as required by Article 25, paragraph 1 (implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures) and Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c, of the GDPR (minimization principle).

Instead of data required for recording and managing employee working time, the system also included PESEL numbers and passport numbers. This data served as an identifier ensuring the unambiguous identification of the employee. Only after the incident was this data replaced with identification numbers. The act of replacing one data item that poses a high risk with another, such as an identification number, is consistent with the principle of data minimization.

Obligation to Directly Notify Individuals Whose Data Has Been Breached

The controller rightly concluded that the personal data breach posed a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and notified the affected individuals. The notification format varied; the controller notified former employees only by issuing two press releases. In the opinion of the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO), this form of notification cannot be considered direct notification of a personal data breach. The supervisory authority issued a warning to the controller for failing to directly notify former employees.

Can franchisees be considered controllers?

During the proceedings, the President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO) also examined whether McDonald's could also be considered a controller of the personal data of McDonald's franchisee employees, who had also reported a personal data breach related to the same security incident. The President of the UODO indicated that a controller is the entity that decides on the purpose of data processing and determines the measures to be used to achieve that purpose. McDonald's owned the schedule module used to manage and record the working hours of restaurant employees, including franchisee employees, and as the creator and owner of the module, it decided on the purposes and methods of personal data processing. It defined the software's functionalities and the methods of processing, including the scope of personal data collected.

McDonald's selected a processor, 24/7 Communication, to which it transferred the schedule module for the purpose of managing working hours and recording working hours. Both the conclusion of contracts and the transmission of all information to franchisees were conducted through McDonald's.

These circumstances determine the status of the controller, and it was impossible to conclude that McDonald's role in its relationship with 24/7 Communication and McDonald's franchisees was irrelevant to determining the purposes and methods of processing the personal data of franchisee employees, and therefore irrelevant to McDonald's's acceptance of liability, which the controller bears under the GDPR, for breaches of personal data protection, including those of McDonald's franchisee employees.
