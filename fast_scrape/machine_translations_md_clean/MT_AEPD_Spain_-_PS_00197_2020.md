The Spanish DPA (AEPD) imposed a fine of €200,000 on the energy supplier, I-DE, Redes Eléctricas Inteligentes SAU. I-DE had sent a letter to end consumers requiring them to get in touch with regards to unpaid invoices despite a contractual arrangement providing for an intermediary to communicate with end users (breach of Articles 6(1)(b), 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(c) GDPR).

## English Summary

### Facts

Energia y Servicios Aby 2018 SL (ESA 2018) and Watium SL filed a complaint against I-DE, Redes Eléctricas Inteligentes SAU (I-DE, previously Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica) before the Spanish DPA (AEPD).

Watium is an electric power trading company which is subscribed with the energy distribution company I-DE by way of a network access contract (ATR). This contract is refers to Articles 3(2) and 3(3) of the Royal Decree 1435/2002. The contract included the identification and contact of the end consumer, the logo of Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica (now i-DE) and the identification of Watium. Although signed by the two entities, there is no place for the end consumer's signature in the contract.

In the letters sent by Iberdrola/I-DE to Watium end consumers in 2018, Iberdrola/I-DE stated that the were forced to send Watium (according to the law) a request for payment for unpaid invoices. They requires that the end consumer get in contact with their provider company.

Watium informed these facts to the Spanish Competition Authority (Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia - CNMC) and the Spanish DPA (AEPD) in January 2018.

At the time, the AEPD issued a report stating that it could be concluded that processing of personal data carried out by I-DE violated data protection law (legal basis and data protection principles). The report highlighted that the appropriate legal basis would have been contractual necessity (Article 6(1)(c)) but the processing of personal data of the consumer (who acts by way of an intermediary) is not necessary for the fulfillment of that contract as the intermediary is precisely there to deal with the communication with these types of communications. The AEPD at the time added that I-DE violated the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation (Article 5(1)(b) and (c)).

In January 2020, Energia y Servicios Aby 2018 SL (ESA 2018), another electric power trading company subscribed to I-DE complained to the AEPD about identical letters of non-payment sent directly to end consumers.

The CNMC outlined that it could not be concluded that I-DE had not acted anti-competitively in breach of Competition Law.

### Dispute

Did sending a letter to require an end consumer of an energy distributor to get in touch with regards to a unpaid invoice when an intermediary was set up communicate with the end user breach Articles 6(1)(b), 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(c) GDPR?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) deemed itself competent under Article 58(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 47 of the Spanish Data Protection Law (LOPDGDD) despite the Competition Law aspect of the case.

The DPA went on to outline that the contract between the two complainants and I-DE were network access contracts (ATR) which refer to Articles 3(2) and 3(3) of the Royal Decree 1435/2002 (which regulates the conditions for contract for the acquisition of energy and access to low voltage network). The DPA analysed the wording of the contract against Article 3(2) Royal Decree 1435/2002 and outlined that this provision refers to data protection law in relation to processing of personal data. The DPA specified that the principle of purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b) GDPR) was relevant. In this ATR contract, reference to Article 3(2) of the Royal Decree established that the purpose for transferring personal data to I-DE would be exclusively so it provides the end consumer with electricity. Therefore, the letters of non-payment that I-DE sent to end consumers directly breached the contract terms and were incompatible with the purpose stated in Article 3(2) of the Royal Decree. Similarly, the principle of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR) was infringed as a result.

In relation to the reference to Article 3(3) of the Royal Decree, the Spanish DPA outlined that this meant that if the distributor (I-DE) wishes to address the end consumer, it should only do so through the "marketer" acting as an intermediary (i.e. Watium or ESA 2018). Therefore, the distributor should not directly communicate with the end consumer since there is an intermediary for this.

The DPA conceded that Article 4(4) of the Royal Decree 1164/2001 provides that the distributor can suspend the electricity supply as a result of non-payment and can contact the end user with the sole aim of requiring payment. Therefore, communication between the distributor and the end consumer is limited. However, the Spanish DPA held that in this context, I-DE sent an informational letter, to request them to get in touch to comply with the contractual obligations. Therefore it cannot be said that I-DE's action fell within the permission granted under with Article 4(4) of the Royal Decree 1164/2001.

The DPA went on to address the intervention of the Spanish Competition Authority. It clarified that the Competition Authority notified the Spanish DPA that it did not consider I-DE's actions to be anti-competitive in breach of competition law. It also accepted the fact that the Competition Authority had been aware that I-DE sent letters. However, it was not information received from I-DE directly.

In relation to the legal basis for processing data, the Spanish DPA clarified that I-DE claimed to rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. However, the DPA held that I-DE provided no reasoning nor evidence of balancing the interests at stake. There was therefore nearly no justifications for relying on Article 6(1)(f) in ID-E's submissions. The DPA outlined that I-DE would have had to demonstrate, after a balancing of factors, that there was a legitimate interest pursued by the distributor or marketer that outweigh the end consumer's rights and freedoms. According to the DPA, the nature of the letter by I-DE appeared almost like a threat or pressure to contact the distributor. Therefore, it did not count as a legitimate interest that outweighed the rights and freedoms of the end consumer even if the ultimate end interest for the distributor was getting the payment owed. The DPA concluded that the distributor would have a right to recover the money owed, but this should not be confused with an illegal processing of personal data.

As such, the Spanish DPA imposed a fine of € 200000 on I-DE for the violation of Article 6(1)(b), Articles 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

## Comment

This decision is interesting given the ongoing discussion on cooperation between national data protection authorities and national competition authorities. It is clear that the two legal fields are increasingly interacting with one another.

It is interesting that there was interactions between the Spanish DPA and Spanish Competition Authority in the assessment of facts.

Additionally, the DPA investigated the wording of the legislation on network access contracts in light of data protection law.

tion related to the contract itself that is not the subject of this express legal reflection.
Indeed, the Proposal focuses the entirety of its argumentation on considering that,
As indicated on page 43, after citing the acts of communication between the parties to the
contract that are included in the electrical legislation, "between the detailed relationship
exposed, no point is found or written about the sending of infor-
explanations explaining to the final consumer, among other things, the alleged non-compliance
contractual relationship between the marketing company and the distribution company, such as
is the case that concerns us ”, adding later that“ the sending of infor-
control to final consumers of the alleged contractual breaches of
the marketer with the distributor does not fall within the range of communications
tions necessary and pertinent for the performance of the contract by the entity
distribution authority ”, since, it seems, these communications should be carried out
carried out “only and exclusively through a marketer, as the latter has constituted

Thus, the Proposal seems to consider that even when there is a relationship
contractual agreement between the distribution company and the final consumer, even if the
cializer signs the ATR contract as agent (with express power, that is, without
act on their own behalf) of the consumer, the development of said relationship only

The Proposed Resolution on pages 44 and 45 states the following:
“If we enter into the content of the letters sent by the claimed entity to the
final consumers (point 5 of the allegations), we must indicate that the article

dor: "
Apart from the confusing wording of the paragraph reproduced, it causes at least per-
plejidad to my client the fact that the Proposal for Resolution omits, in the
production of article 52.3 of Law 24/2013, of December 26, on the Electricity Sector.

according to which the possibility of suspension of supply will take place “\[s\] without prejudice to

And said omission is essential in the present case, since article 4.4 of the
Royal Decree 1164/2001, of October 26, which establishes access fees
to the electricity transmission and distribution networks (hereinafter, “RD
1164/2001 ”), which is the one that determines the conditions to which the aforementioned article refers.

Communication must include the process of disconnection of the consumer from the networks of
distribution for non-payment, specifying the date from which the dis-
connection, if the amounts owed are not paid on a prior date. "
That is, article 4.4 of RD 1164/2001, which is the one that establishes the conditions in
that the suspension of the electricity supply may take place as a result of the
non-payment of the ATR contract rates, does not limit the communications of my client
with the client, but only the possibility of requesting the same directly the
payment of the fee (despite your status as a debtor and the joint and several liability that
proclaims in the same normative body). And indeed, my client at no time
ment has required the consumer to pay said fee which, on the other hand, he already
has satisfied the marketer, but is limited to showing him that this
marketer has not paid the fee, previously paid by him, and
that this may entail for that consumer the consequence, which evidently
It directly affects the suspension of the electricity supply.
Because the consequence of the marketing company not paying the amount
of said rates to the distributor, regardless of her condition as agent of the
consumer at the signing of the contract, it will be the suspension of the electricity supply to said
consumer. For this purpose, it is irrelevant with regard to the application of article 52.3 of the
LSE that the consumer has or has not paid said rates to the marketer, given
that the consequence in either case will be the aforementioned suspension, no matter how much

Moreover, following the reasoning contained in the Proposal for Resolution, it is possible to

in relation to their clients natural persons under penalty, in the opinion of the AEPD, of violating
said regulation.
Such a glaring conclusion could only lead to the filing of the present proceedings.
inasmuch as, as indicated by the Advocate General of the Court of Justice,
of the European Union, Mr. Michael Bobek, in §99 of his conclusions referring to the
Case C-13/16 (Rīgas satiksme case), filed on January 26, 2017:
"In summary, common sense is not a source of law, but, of course,
it should serve as a guide for its interpretation. It would be most regrettable if
protection of personal data will be degraded in the obstruction of personal data-
them."
In the present case, said conclusion could not be more evident, since the sub-

3. Regarding the intervention of the CNMC in the present case
The Motion for a Resolution considers that the statement contained in the allegations
of my principal to the Initiation Agreement, according to which it was indicated that the Commission

was aware of the letters sent by the former to consumers.
expressly stated by the aforementioned Commission, summarily concluding that:
“It follows, therefore, that the distributor did NOT send the CNMC any letter to
their prior review, sending the informative letters to the final consumers without "the
review ”of the CNMC, and, therefore, being totally impossible,“ (…) ratify the legality
of the conduct of my principal (…) ”by the CNMC, as stated by the entity

However, it is enough to contrast the content of the response provided by the CNMC to
that AEPD to verify that the statement contained in the Proposal for Resolution
does not sympathize with the reality of the facts
Thus, in the first place, as already indicated in the allegations of my client to the Agreement

That is, although the AEPD does not provide a copy of the letter, its content was more than

The CNMC replied that what it did not know was the specific letter sent to customers
of Watium, but that, nevertheless, he did know that these letters were sent to the
I-DE clients whose marketing company did not pay access fees after
have completed the voluntary payment period and after having been reliably required-

In conclusion: the CNMC was not only perfectly aware of the existence of the letters,

4. On the legal basis of the treatment in the present case.
It has already been amply analyzed in section 2 of this allegation that my command
proceeded to the processing of the personal data of its clients for the sending of the
mentioned letters as said sending is necessary for the normal development of
the contractual relationship that binds both parties, since it can only consider-
it is, according to all logic, necessary to warn customers of the suspension of the supply
as a consequence of non-payment of ATR rates instead of proceeding to suspend

However, for the denied assumption that this AEPD, against the criterion supported
even by the energy regulator, the CNMC, consider that the legal basis of the treatment
ment cannot be considered the adequate development of the contractual relationship,
There is no doubt that the communication to I-DE clients that said sus-
pension is going to take place will be, at least, in their interest, who may
adopt the measures they deem appropriate to avoid said suspension. Of this
Thus, it would be applicable to the assumption, at least, and although the
legal basis of the contractual relationship, the rule of the prevailing legitimate interest established
cited in article 6.1 f) of the RGPD.
It should be remembered that the first paragraph of recital 47 of the RGPD states that:
“The legitimate interest of a person responsible for the treatment, including that of a person responsible for

occur, for example, when there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the
and the person in charge, as in situations in which the interested party is a

Note that the RGPD considers that the prevalence of legitimate interest can be seen
reinforced in cases such as the one analyzed, given that the information provided to the

supply was suspended, to a greater extent, when said customers would have
made the payment of the amount corresponding to said access toll to the
distribution. And it should be emphasized that the aforementioned suspension may take place independently of
pendency of the person who has materially signed the ATR contract, as
expressly follows from article 4.4 of RD 1164/2001, which develops the provisions

Even though the two legitimating bases referred to with

For the aforementioned reasons, the collection of access fees, as soon as it has

maintenance and proper operation of the electrical system is directly related
with the fulfillment of a mission of public interest, which is also imposed on the
distribution companies by legal mandate, which would even allow to substantiate the
treatment in the provisions of article 6.1 e) of the RGPD.
In conclusion, as indicated in this document, there is no doubt that I-
DE is fully entitled to process data for the purpose
to carry out the aforementioned communications to its clients as a consequence
of the development of the contractual relationship maintained with them. But even in the
denied assuming that said legal basis was again discarded by the
AEPD, the treatment would also be based on the legitimate interest of the con-
electrical sinks to maintain the contracted electricity supply and in the public interest
derived from the fact that the income from the payment of the ATR tariffs is nothing but
an act of collecting said income for its contribution to the maintenance of the
electric system. And ultimately, the legitimate interest of
the distribution company, legally obliged to carry out this collection activity and
bear the risks of non-payment, in recovering amounts that it has been forced to
enter for the electrical system despite not having charged them.
Being sufficient the concurrence of a legitimizing base to determine the conformity
to the right of a treatment, it turns out that, in the present case, there are elements
enough to be able to assess the fit of the treatment carried out by my

Indeed, this part fails to find the novel aspect of the aforementioned forecast
legal regarding the sanctioning regime contained in Law 30/1992, of June 26, the
Regulation of the Procedure for the Exercise of Sanctioning Power, approving
by Royal Decree 1398/1993, of August 4 (hereinafter, “REPEPOS”) and the Regulation

in your startup agreements.
In all these norms it was indicated that the Agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure
nador had to incorporate “the sanctions that may correspond, without prejudice to
what results from the instruction ”. This was stated in article 13.1 b) of REPEPOS and
it was reiterated by article 127.1 b) of the RLOPD. However, the AEPD considered
that this did not mean more than indicating the maximum and minimum limits of the sanction that

the concurrent circumstances in the case or the mitigating or aggravating circumstances that
should be taken into consideration to determine the final amount of the sanction to

2. Secondly, reference should be made to what, despite its more than confusing
wording seems to want to indicate the Proposed Resolution when on pages 41
and 42 of the same, the following is stated:
“It is therefore not true, as the claimed entity affirms, that Article 85 establishes-
ca: “(…) For this purpose, it should be recalled that, according to Article 85, the amount of the penalty

ral of said article refers to the recognition of the responsibility of the offender and
no to the decision of the amount of the sanction as it is literally established that: “1.-
Initiated a sanctioning procedure, if the offender acknowledges his responsibility,
may resolve the procedure with the imposition of the appropriate sanction ”and thus,
must interpret, that is, according to the proper sense of the words, and not the discretion of
the part. (…)
Regarding the statement made by the claimed entity when indicating that, “in the present
In this case, said amount is set in the act of initiation of said procedure and not
when this is already "started", it could not be considered true, because in the
"Agreement" to initiate the file is expressly indicated that, "for the purposes of the
seen in art. 64.2 b) of the LPACAP, the corresponding sanction would be
a fine of 200,000 euros (two hundred thousand euros), without prejudice to what results from the
instruction","
Despite the less complex wording reproduced, he intuits this part that is
wants to refute by the same what has already been alleged by my client in the sense of remembering
that article 85.1 of the LPACAP provides that “\[i\] initiated a sanctioning procedure-
dor, if the offender acknowledges his responsibility, the procedure may be resolved with
the imposition of the appropriate sanction ”(the underlining is ours) and that the first
ciso of article 85.3 of the LPACAP adds that “\[i\] n both cases, when the sanction
is solely of a pecuniary nature, the competent body to resolve the procedure
ment will apply reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the penalty provided
put, these being cumulative with each other ”(emphasis added)
As can be seen, from the literality of the precept to which the Pro-
Resolution does not follow, as it seems to indicate, that the benefits
seen in the same require the quantification of the sanction in the Initiation Agreement, for
how much:
 First, Article 85.1 of the LPACAP does not require such a prior determination,

tion as appropriate. That is, the norm, which in any case is applicable “initiated the proce-
procedure ”, provides for the possible acknowledgment of responsibility that may determine the
imposition of the sanction "that proceeds", so that this fixation seems to be foreseen with

3. Third, the Proposed Resolution, again in terms that in the opinion
from this part are respectfully completely confused, it seems to give
tend that the setting of the amount of the sanction in the Initiation Agreement is clearly
adequate, inasmuch as my client has had the opportunity to express himself about the
concurrent circumstances in the case both before and after
at the initiation of the sanctioning procedure.
Thus, in relation to the activity prior to the aforementioned Agreement, the Proposal for Re-

2. The AEPD affirms that in the present case the facts have been denounced by the
interested parties, noting that “the claimed entity, by making an illicit use of the data
personal data of the clients of the marketing entities, this Agency has had
knowledge of the alleged infringement through the agents of the interested parties
(sic.)".
Although it is difficult to understand the actual content of such a statement, given the
that the recipients are clients not only of the marketers, as seems to be indicated
the AEPD, but also the distributors, the truth is that not even in its written
claim or in the query made at the time to the Legal Office of the AEPD
Nor in the complaint made at the time before the CNMC, Watium claims to act in
representation of its clients (which are also my client), but only and ex-
exclusively in his own name.
And understand this part that the AEPD cannot take as true or assume in any way
some a representation that not only is not accredited in any case, but also
furthermore, he refuses, since Watium always claims to act on his own behalf. For

Therefore, there is no doubt that this entity holds the status of interested party for the purposes of
the provisions of the data protection regulations, it is completely inadmissible to
application of such an aggravating circumstance.
3. Thirdly, the AEPD says that I-DE acted “knowing that there were different
complaints filed and reports issued by different public bodies
who rejected said action, the entity continued to send information letters to the
end customers, and, therefore, could constitute an illegal act ”.
My client cannot but reiterate that he does not know what those reports are and that he
tions that she was supposed to know when she carried out the treatment of the
data. Indeed, since obviously they cannot be the ones that are the object
of this procedure there are only two possibilities: that the AEPD refers to the
Announcement filed by Watium with the CNMC or that it is the report requested by
that entity to the Legal Office of the AEPD.
Well, as a first consideration, both the complaint and the request for a report
were after treatment, so it could hardly be done after
knowing the "resolution" issued or the report issued.
In addition, with respect to the claims made mentioned in the Proposal for
Resolution, it is necessary to show that the complaint made by Watium
before the CNMC (the only one to which reference could be made) was inadmissible for processing
mite, as stated in the administrative file, starting on the contrary
an investigation of Watium herself. Therefore, there was no reproach from the
CNMC to the behavior of my client.
It is true that this reproach is contained in the report of the Legal Cabinet in respect of
put to the query raised by Watium, but it is that my client has not had
knowledge of said report until the Agreement to initiate this procedure
made mention of this. All this, without prejudice to the fact that, as we understand that
given sufficiently accredited, said report lacks an admissible legal basis
in right.
That is, and paraphrasing what was stated in the Proposal, my client issued the letters
without knowing that a claim would be made later that was inadmissible and
would issue by that AEPD (not by different agencies) a single report, not communicating
do to I-DE, who rejected said action.
All this without prejudice to the fact that, as was carefully analyzed in the allegations to
the Proposal for Resolution and it has been insisted in this writing, the criterion supported
made by the Legal Cabinet in the aforementioned report not only is not coherent
with the personal data protection regulations, but even contravenes the
criteria that in relation to the interpretation of the precepts that it carries out
adopted by the National Energy Commission.
In any case, as can be contrasted, what is stated in the Proposal for a Resolution
tion and the reality of the case as regards the intentionality of my principal or
they keep the slightest relationship.
4. Regarding the categories of data being processed, the Proposed Resolution
tion points out, in our view quite surprisingly, that “in this
case, when the claimed entity makes use of the name, surname, address, etc., of
the clients illegally, it is clear use of data protected by the RGPD and, by
therefore, subject to aggravation in application of section g) of article 83.2 of the RGPD ”.

But it is that, in addition, from what is literally stated in the Proposal it follows that

it is manifest and evident. Thus, what the Proposal indicates, and let us

infringement, since all categories of data are protected by the aforementioned text

5. In relation to the supposed economic benefit, the Proposal for Resolution is

As stated in section 4 of the third claim of this writing, the in-

Articles 13, 14 and 18 of the LSE, so my client does not know what benefit was obtained

6. And finally, regarding my client's relationship with the realization of treatment-

We must first point out that, now, it seems that finally the AEPD,
even with the intention of aggravating the sanction imposed, it recognizes that

that it maintains a contractual relationship with them.

river or substitute for end customers, as indicated in articles 3.2 and 3.3 of the Real
Decree 1435/2002, of December 27, which regulates the basic conditions
of contracts for the acquisition of energy and access to low voltage networks. In
said contract, there is the following clause:
"The undersigned, acting as agent and substitute for the client for the purposes of the

The signatories of the contract are, on the one hand, the trading company and, on the one hand,
part of the supplying company, the contract administrator and the Head of Distribution
zone tion.
In article 3.2 of RD 1435/2002, cited in the contract, it is established, on the finalization
of the processing of personal data, the following: “2. (…) The supply contract
between the consumer and the marketer, it must be formalized in writing. In it you must

Therefore, it is not possible to process the data initially collected for another purpose than

data are processed for purposes other than the one that justified the original treatment.
Rio, what it prohibits is a treatment for purposes not compatible with the initial one.
Article 3.2 of RG 1435/2002 referred to in the contract signed between the commercial entity
cializadora and the distribution entity establishes that the personal data that the entity
marketing company will "transfer" to the "distributor" entity, they will be solely and exclusively
so that it provides the final consumer with the electricity supply: “(…) transfer to the
distributor the data necessary for the supply (…) ”, that is, the data necessary

the electricity supply (identification of the final consumer, supply address,
contracted company, etc. This purpose or another compatible with it, are the only ones for the
that the distribution entity can make a lawful treatment of personal data
that the marketer has provided you.
In the present case, the letters sent by the distribution entity to consumers
final meters said verbatim:
“March 13, 2018.- Dear consumer: By means of this letter I put-
We know that, on February 8, 2018, we were forced to
to be sent to your electric power marketer WATIUM, SL., in accordance with the
current regulations (art. 4.3 and 4.4 of Royal Decree 7764/2007, of October 26), a

Non-payment of third party access fees to the network may give rise, according to

keep in touch with your marketing company to remedy this situation without
that in no case does this information letter imply a request for payment to

Therefore, it is clear that the processing of personal data carried out by the
distribution company, when sending informational letters of the alleged breaches
contractual agreements of the trading company, to final consumers, in addition to
"Beg" them to contact the marketing entity so that it
"Proceed to correct the problem" is not compatible with the stated purpose

On the other hand, article 3.3 of the aforementioned Royal Decree 1435/2002, establishes that: “In the
case in which the consumer chooses to contract energy and access to the networks through
Through a marketer who acts as a substitute for the consumer, the marketer
The buyer must have sufficient power granted by the consumer in favor of the merchant.

Credit with the distributor will be for all purposes that of the corresponding consumer.
In any case, the distributor will maintain with the final consumer all the obligations
tions relating to the access contract and in the event of termination of the contract between the
merchant and consumer, this will be the holder of the guarantee deposit, as well as
of any other right associated with the installation, without it being enforceable, for
part of the distributor, any update due to the contractual renewal ”.
According to this precept, if the distributor wishes to address the final consumer who has
dealt with the supply of electrical energy through a marketer, it may only di-
abide by it through the marketer, for having constituted itself as agent
of the final consumer acting before the distributor as a " substitute for the consumer ".
The cited article, therefore, does not contemplate direct action between the distributor and
the final consumer, since he has appointed an agent for his relationship with
that, not existing in any case, a direct contractual relationship between the distributor
buyer and the final consumer but through marketing, whose position in the
access subscribed with the distributor is, as established in the aforementioned article: “(…) to all
the effects that of the final consumer ”.
The claimed entity is accepted in article 4.4 of RD 1164/2001, where they are established
the conditions for suspending the electricity supply, as a result of non-payment
of the rates, to have sufficient power to address the final consumer
with a different purpose than that established in article 3.2 of RD 1435/2020, this
is, to send them informational letters with the "request" that they get in touch with
the marketing entity so that it fulfills its contractual obligations.
Well, the cited article establishes the following: “4. The distribution company may
suspend the access fee contract when at least two have elapsed
months since he had reliably required payment to the consumer or its maintenance
date, in accordance with the scope of application of the access fees established in
Article 1, paragraph 1, of this Royal Decree, without it having been made
cho cash. For these purposes, the request will be made by means of a referral, to the address
address that for communication purposes appears in the access fee contract, for
any means that allows proof of receipt by the interested party, as well
as well as the date, identity and content of this, leaving the distribution company
obliged to keep in its possession the accreditation of the notification made. In the su-
post of rejection of the notification, the circumstances of the attempt to
notification and the procedure will be considered completed. Said communication must include the
procedure of disconnection of the consumer from the distribution networks due to non-payment,
Said the date from which the disconnection will take place, if the payment is not made on
above the amounts owed (…) ”.
Well, as this article establishes, when the distribution company is obliged to
to suspend the electricity supply service to the final consumer due to non-payment, it is

when it can be directed to the final consumer, but to the sole effect of requirement
of the payment of the electricity tariff, in accordance with the scope of application established in the
Article 1.1 of the aforementioned Royal Decree. In addition, the requirement will be practiced in the

It will include: “ the process of disconnection of the consumer from the distribution networks by
non-payment, specifying the date from which the disconnection will take place, if no

Therefore, the aforementioned article limits the communications of the distribution entity with the
end customer for the sole purpose of requiring payment of the fee, when this is the
direct debtor, and as the claimed entity indicates in its allegations: “in no way

marketing entity in order for it to comply with its contractual obligations with
the distribution entity, without entering to assess this Agency the other allegations where
the possible consequences of the marketing company not satisfying

Organism.
3.- Regarding the intervention of the CNMC in the present case, the entity now recognizes
claimed, changing its initial argument that: “The CNMC is aware of the
sending these communications, at least as a result of the complaint
formulated by the marketer (…). "
Well, it must be remembered that, on 06/25/19, the claimed entity affirmed to
this Agency verbatim that: “ These letters have already been subject to review by the
Regulatory body, the National Commission of Markets and Competition and
strictly comply with the aforementioned regulations in force (…) ”.
Report requested from the Regulatory Body on the statements made by the
claimed entity, on 02/26/20, the CNMC sent this Agency a report where
these assertions were flatly denied:
"Regarding this letter, the following must be reported according to the data
working in the Directorates of instruction of this Commission: - Iberdrola Distribución
Eléctrica, SAU has not approached the CNMC before sending Watium customers,
SL the letters in question. The CNMC has not reported, either favorable or
unfavorably, the making of said shipments. - On January 22, 2018
received at the CNMC a letter of complaint from Watium, SL due to the letters of
that is (…).

As a conclusion to the report issued by the Competition Directorate of the CNMC,
considers that: “(…) it could not be concluded that Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica, SAU
incurred in violation of article 3 of Law 15/2007, of July 3, on the Defense of the
Competition, due to acts of unfair competition. Attached to
In this regard, communication dated April 19, 2018 sent to the complainant by
of the Directorate of Competition. It remains to clarify that, although the communication of 19
April 2018 mentioned refers at the end to a transfer of the information to the Directorate
of Energy, this is produced for different purposes (valuation of the possible
non-compliance on the part of the trading company Watium, SL of the applicable regulations
regarding payment of the network access toll) ”.
It is striking to see how the claimed entity, to justify the treatment of the data
end customers' personals for sending informative letters, "begging them"
also that they contact the marketing entity, excuse themselves
initially in the approval made by the CNMC, indicating to this Agency that, the
"Letter" conformed to current regulations as it had been endorsed by the Agency
Regulator and that after he denied it by denying knowledge of the
existence of the letters, the claimed entity will change its argumentation by trying
Now, with these new allegations, justify that: (…) The CNMC did know that these
letters were sent to I-DE clients whose marketing company did not pay
the access fees after the end of the voluntary payment period and after having
has been reliably required for this purpose, as expressly provided by law
applicable, in order to avoid the supply being suspended without the knowledge of the
holder of the contract, nor to be able to have it, that his access contract was in the
of non-payment ”.
It is true, as the claimed entity affirms, that the CNMC learned of the existence of the
letters long after they were sent, but it was not through the distribution entity, if
not through the complaint filed by the marketing entity before said
Organism.
In short, it is not true that the CNMC knew of the existence of the letters through
of the distribution entity : “(…) Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica, SAU has not
addressed to the CNMC before sending Watium, SL clients the letters that are
treats (…) ” . Nor is it true that said Agency reported favorably. Other
Another thing is that said Agency had knowledge of the letters sent
a long time later, through the complaint filed by the entity
trading company before said Body but the fact that later the CNMC
decided to inform the Directorate General of Energy the facts is
an issue that this Agency cannot enter into to assess, as it falls outside the scope of
competition, so it is still impossible to take into account the
repeated allegations presented by the entity claimed in section 3 of the
Point 2.
On the legal basis of the treatment in the present case (section 4 of point 2 of
the allegations).
The claimed entity now welcomes the legitimate interest established in article 6.1 f)
of the RGPD for the sending of the letters, without even justifying the reasons that
lead to this, limiting themselves to indicating that:
C / Jorge Juan, 6
www.aepd.es

Page 29
29/37
“(…) In this way, it would be applicable to the assumption, at least, and although
considers sufficient the legal basis of the contractual relationship, the rule of interest
legitimate prevailing established in article 6.1 f) of the RGPD (...) ”, not providing
no legal basis that allows weighing, even minimally, the legality of the
treatment of the data of the end consumers, by sending the letters to
those referred to in this procedure, suffering from an absolute lack of
motivation, since only recital 47 of the RGPD is transcribed at this point
for your defense.
Therefore, if the claimed entity now avails itself of the legitimate interest for the
treatment of personal data of end customers, the rule requires you to carry out
a balancing exercise between said legitimate interest and fundamental rights
of those affected. In this sense, the Judgment of the Court of Justice declared
expressly the direct effect of article 7 f) of Directive 95/46 / EC, according to which:
“ The Member States shall provide that the processing of personal data may only be
be carried out if (...) it is necessary to satisfy the legitimate interest pursued by
the person responsible for the treatment or by the third party or third parties to whom the
data, provided that the interest or fundamental rights and freedoms do not prevail
of the interested party that require protection in accordance with article 1.1 of this
Directive".
Therefore, to determine if the application of the aforementioned precept is appropriate, it will be necessary to
apply the rule of weighting provided in it; that is, it would be necessary
assess whether in the specific case under analysis there will be a legitimate interest
pursued by the data controller (marketing company) or by the
third party or third parties to whom the data is communicated (distribution company), which
prevails over the interest or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party
that require protection in accordance with the provisions of article 1 of the RGPD, or if, for
on the contrary, the fundamental rights or interests of the interested parties to whom
refers to the treatment of the data must prevail over the interest in which the entity
claimed seeks to substantiate the processing of personal data.
Thus, in order to carry out the necessary weighting required, you must
consider whether, taking into account the specific circumstances that occur in the
present case, the interest pursued by the distribution entity by sending the letters
informative and "beg" to end consumers, treating their personal data
It must prevail over the right to data protection of those affected.
In the present case, from the reading of the letter sent to the final consumers,
It follows that the purpose pursued by the distribution entity is, firstly,
inform the end consumer of a presumed contractual breach of their entity
marketer with the distribution entity to then "beg" the consumer
final contact with the marketer with the ultimate goal of
he pays what is allegedly owed, otherwise the continuity of
electrical supply to your home may be in danger, observing a possible
intimidating background towards the final consumer, although the distribution entity
keep in stating that said letter is not, at all, a request for payment to the
final consumer as he recognizes that he meets his obligation to pay
billing of electricity consumption to the marketing entity.
C / Jorge Juan, 6

Therefore, it is evident that the ultimate interest, which moves the distribution entity to
send the letters to the final consumers is that the marketer pays them the
owed, even though, from the reading of the letter, the final consumers may
feel "pressured" to contact the marketing entity, under the
"Threat" of suspending the electricity supply if the marketing entity does not
pay what is owed.
Therefore, it is not possible to consider the processing of data as a legitimate interest
personal data of the final consumers by the distribution entity to
send them informational letters of the breaches of the marketing entity and
"Begging" you to get in touch with it to remedy the problem, as
in this case, the rights and freedoms must undoubtedly prevail
fundamentals of the interested party.
However, it is entirely correct that the distribution company has the right to
"Recover some amounts that it has been forced to enter for the electrical system
despite not having collected them ”, by the legal means it deems appropriate, but
the claimed entity should not confuse this right with the presumed "interest
legitimate ”which is used for the illicit treatment of the personal data of the
final consumers
- Regarding the setting of the amount of the sanction in the commencement agreement, (point three-
ro of the allegations).
Indicate, once again, that Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Procedure
Common Administration of Public Administrations, (LPACAP), establishes, in its
article 53.2:
"In addition to the rights provided in the previous section, in the case of
administrative procedures of a sanctioning nature, the alleged
Responsible parties will have the following rights: a) To be notified of the facts that
are charged, of the infractions that such facts may constitute and of the
sanctions that, if applicable, could be imposed (…) ”.
For its part, article 64 of the aforementioned LPACAP establishes, with respect to the
Agreement to initiate procedures of a sanctioning nature, which:
1. The initiation agreement will be communicated to the instructor of the procedure, with transfer
of how many actions exist in this regard, and the interested parties will be notified,
understanding in any case the accused as such. Likewise, the initiation will be communicated
to the complainant when the rules governing the procedure so provide. 2. The
initiation agreement must contain at least: a) Identification of the person or
persons allegedly responsible. b) The facts that motivate the initiation of the
procedure, its possible qualification and the penalties that may correspond, without
detriment of what results from the instruction
Therefore, that the sanctioning body anticipates the amount of the sanction that would proceed
impose, and always depending on what ultimately results from the procedure and that, in the
Proposed Resolution, is proposed, an amount identical to that indicated by the body

sanctioner in the Initiation Agreement, has nothing in particular, nor does it attempt against
no established norm, so it is not appropriate to consider what is alleged by the entity
claimed at this point, even more so when it only records the fact,
without even supporting in the least the reasons that lead him to put in between
said the legality of the sanctioning procedure carried out.
On the other hand, it is not true, as the claimed entity affirms that: “(…) the body
sanctioner is not limited to remembering which is the applicable sanctioning norm, but
assesses effectively, without paying attention at any time to what the
inserted, what concrete sanction, within the limits established by the norm,
it is appropriate to impose (…) ” because in the document initiating the sanctioning proceedings,
You can read verbatim, in your "agreement": " WHAT: for the purposes provided for in art. 64.2
b) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations, the corresponding sanction would be a fine of
200,000 euros (two hundred thousand euros), without prejudice to what results from the instruction ”,
and therefore, the sanction to be imposed becomes conditional on the result of the instruction of the
process. The fact of indicating a specific numerical data of the sanction in the
commencement agreement is simply in application of the provisions of article 64.1.b) of
LPACAP cited above and in application of the provisions of article 68 of the
LOPDGDD, according to which it will be enough to specify the facts that motivate the
opening, identify the person or entity against which the procedure is directed, the
infraction that could have been committed and its possible sanction.
Therefore, the statement made by the entity cannot be taken into account
claimed when it indicates that the possible sanction that may correspond to the
imputed infractions is a determining factor of defenselessness or that implies a rupture
of the principle of separation of the investigation and resolution phases. On the contrary, with
This is in compliance with one of the requirements set forth in the standards outlined.
For its part, article 85 of the LPACAP contemplates the possibility of applying
reductions on the amount of the penalty if the offender acknowledges his responsibility
and in the event of voluntary payment of the penalty. This precept establishes the obligation to
determine those reductions in the notice of initiation of the procedure, which
entails the need to set the amount of the penalty corresponding to the facts
accused and it is not true, as stated by the claimed entity that this article
establish that the amount of the sanction is determined once the
procedure, since the recognition of responsibility and voluntary payment of the
sanction what has to occur after that moment, and not the fixation of the
amount of the penalty.
If this acknowledgment of responsibility or voluntary payment does not occur, which
would determine the termination of the procedure, it is instructed and dictates
later the resolution proposal, in which they have to be fixed in a reasoned way
the facts that are considered proven and their exact legal qualification,
will determine the infringement that, where appropriate, those constitute, the person or persons
responsible and the sanction that is proposed, the evaluation of the tests carried out,
especially those that constitute the basic foundations of the decision. This
must be notified to the interested party, granting him a period to formulate
allegations and present the documents and information deemed pertinent.
C / Jorge Juan, 6

In no case will a resolution be adopted without the interested party having the opportunity to
manifest itself on all the extremes considered.
Therefore, it is not true that the claimed entity has seen its rights and
it cannot be said that the determination of the amount of the fine in the
opening does not imply any reduction in said guarantees causing helplessness.
Nor does this circumstance break the impartiality of the investigating body, which provides
of all the powers conferred by the regulations in question and full freedom to
dictate your motion for a resolution. You just have to go to the Agency's website, in the
that all resolutions issued in sanctioning procedures are published,
to check the large number of them ending with a file resolution of
actions, following the proposal issued by the instructor of the procedure, as well
such as those in which said proposal increased or decreased the amount of the
sanction set in the opening agreement or even proposed the application of a power of attorney
corrective other than the sanction of a fine.
- On the application in the present case of the principle of proportionality and the
modifying circumstances of the concurrent responsibility in the same
(fourth point of the allegations):
a) .- Regarding the number of letters sent to clients, indicate that, for this Agency
there is the same rejection of an illicit treatment of 2,598 personal data as a
illicit treatment of 1,462 personal data, so it is not appropriate to reconsider the
aggravating point a) of article 83.2 of the RGPD.
b) .- On the statement made by the claimed entity when it alleges that:
“(…) Understands this part that the AEPD cannot take as true or assume in
In no way a representation that not only is not in any case accredited,
but also refuses, since Watium always claims to act on his own
Name. Therefore, there is no doubt that this entity holds the status of
interested party for the purposes provided in the data protection regulations, is
the application of such an aggravating circumstance is completely inadmissible ”,
It should be remembered that, for example, in the claim itself presented by the entity
Watium SL., In this Agency, it was indicated verbatim:
“A claim is filed against Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica, SAU (company
electricity distribution company) by sending a series of letters (we have
proof of 2598 letters) to the clients of Watium, SL (trading company
of electrical energy) distracting the purpose for which the data were transferred from
the marketer to the distributor (purpose: supply) lacking legal basis
to get in touch with the clients of Watium, SL
c) .- On the statement made by the claimed entity when it indicates that: “3. He says,
thirdly, the AEPD, that I-DE acted “knowing that there were different
complaints filed and reports issued by different public bodies
who rejected said action, the entity continued to send information letters to the
end customers, and, therefore, could constitute an illegal act ”.

My client cannot but reiterate that he does not know what those reports are and
resolutions that she was supposed to know when she carried out the treatment
of the data. Indeed, since obviously they cannot be what they are
object of this procedure there are only two possibilities: that the AEPD refers to the
complaint filed by Watium with the CNMC or that it is the requested report
by that entity to the Legal Office of the AEPD.
Well, as a first consideration, both the complaint and the request for a report
were after treatment, so it could hardly be done after
knowing the "resolution" issued or the report issued (...).
Well, as stated in the sanctioning file, there is a certificate issued by the
Electronic Notification Service and Electronic Address, dated
acceptance 05/23/19 and being the receiver \*\*\* NIF. 1 AAA in representing
IBERDROLA DISTRIBUCIÓN ELÉCTRICA SA, with NIF A95075578, this Agency
sent to the claimed entity the complaint filed with this Agency by the entity
Watium SL, including: - Model network access contract signed between the two
entities. - Sample letter sent by Iberdrola to WATIUM SL clients. - Letter
sent to the Markets and Competition Commission on 01/22/18. - Written
sent to Iberdrola on 01/23/18. - Request for a legal report to the AEPD, dated
02/19/18. - Response of the legal office of the AEPD, dated 07/24/18 - Request
from the DPD of WATIUM SL to the DPD of IBERDROLA, dated 10/24/18. - Burofax a
IBERDROLA, to stop sending the letters, 10/24/18. - Service response
IBERDROLA legal, dated 11/02/18. - Examples of letters sent by
IBERDROLA, Q1 2018, Q3 2018 and Q1 2019.
However, the foregoing, knowing that there were different claims
filed and reports issued by different public bodies that put into
doubt said action, dated 09/05/19, (3 months later), the claimed entity
sends customers of the trading company ENERGÍA Y SERVICIOS ABY, SL the
The same letters that I sent some time before to the clients of the marketer
WATIUM SL.
Therefore, it is not true, as the claimed entity tries to justify that it was unaware
the reports and resolutions that questioned the processing of personal data of
end customers, thereby evidencing the negligence of the entity's conduct
claimed, since its action was carried out without the due level of due diligence.
d) .- On the alleged seriousness derived from the treatment of categories of data
limited only to those of a merely identifying nature, remember that the
Article 1.2 of the RGPD establishes that: “This Regulation protects the rights and
fundamental freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their right to freedom
protection of personal data ”, defining in its article 4.1, the“ personal data ”
as: “all information about an identified or identifiable natural person, whose
identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of a
identifier, such as a name, an identification number, etc. ”, and by
Therefore, in this case, when the claimed entity makes an illicit use of the name,
surname or address, is sufficiently clear evidence of an illicit use of data
personal protected by the RGPD and therefore, object of aggravation in application of the
section g) of article 83.2 of the RGPD.
C / Jorge Juan, 6

d) .- Regarding the alleged illegal use of the data to avoid losses to I-DE, indicate that,
From the letters sent to the end customers, it is clear that the objective
The end of the claimed entity, as argued above, was to avoid
the losses that the contractual breach of the marketers was
producing in the distributor, so it is not appropriate to consider the allegations
made at this point.
e) .- Regarding the connection between I-DE and data processing, indicate that it is notorious
that an entity like I-DE, handles personal data of more than 6 million
direct and indirect customers, through marketers, in addition to having a
staff of more than 35,000 employees, so that, an entity like her, is owed
require a maximum level of due diligence in the processing of personal data and
its management, both of the personal data of direct customers and the data
personal data that the marketers provide you with in order to send them
power supply.
Therefore, the interpretation made by this Agency of the aggravating factors established in the
RGPD and the LOPDGDD is totally in accordance with the infractions committed by the
claimed entity.
III
Thus, the known facts constitute an infringement, attributable to the
claimed entity, for violation of the articles:
- Art. 6.1.b) of the RGPD, which establishes that: “the processing of data will only be lawful
to if it is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is
part or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures ”.
- Art. 5.1.b) of the RGPD which establishes that: “personal data will be collected
for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes and will not be further processed
in a manner incompatible with said purposes, (purpose limitation).
- Art. 5.1.c) of the RGPD, which establishes that: “Personal data will be the ade-
appropriate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are treated, (data minimization).
For its part, article 72.1.a and b) of the LOPDGDD considers as "very serious",
Prescription purposes, the processing of personal data if, " violates the
principles and guarantees established in article 5 of the RGPD "and if it is carried out," without
any of the conditions of legality established in article 6 of the RGPD concur ”,
respectively.
IV
These infractions can be sanctioned with a fine of € 20,000,000 maximum
or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of a higher amount, in accordance with article 83.5.a) of the RGPD.

In accordance with the indicated precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the sanction to be imposed in
In this case, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted according to
with the following aggravating criteria, established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:
- The nature, severity and duration of the offense, taking into account the nature
nature, scope or purpose of the treatment operation in question, as well as
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages
who have suffered, when carrying out an improper treatment of personal data,
(section a).
- The intentionality or negligence in the infringement. In the present case we are
before negligent action, because even having knowledge of the filing
of claims before different public bodies, by the company
Watium, Iberdrola continues to send letters to the clients of the claimed entities

- The categories of personal data affected by the infringement, already
that the data processed, in this case, are customer identification data

- The way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement, since
that the AEPD became aware of the infringement through the claim of the
interested party, (section h).
- The losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement, in

It is also considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted in accordance with the
following aggravating criteria, established in article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD:
- The linking of the activity of the offender with the performance of treatment of
personal data, (section b).
The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
regarding the offense committed by violating the provisions of its articles 5.1.b and c) and
6.1.b) allows setting a penalty of 200,000 euros (two hundred thousand euros), considered
as “very serious”, for the purposes of this prescription, in article 71.1.a and b)
respectively, of the LOPDGDD.
In view of the above, the following is issued:
