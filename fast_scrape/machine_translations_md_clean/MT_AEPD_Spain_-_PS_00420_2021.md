## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject, a landlord, had a bank account with the controller, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. A tenant made a rent payment to the data subject's account and asked the controller for a receipt. In response, the controller provided the tenant with a document containing the data subject's account balance.

The data subject subsequently filed a complaint with the DPA.

### Holding

The case was categorized as a personal data security breach. The DPA held that the controller violated the integrity and confidentiality of personal data when it shared with a third party a document containing the data subject’s account balance. The DPA imposed a sanction of €50,000 for the infringement of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR").

The DPA also held that when the breach occurred, technical and organizational measures were not in place to prevent the data subject’s account balance from being seen by whoever requested proof of payment. A sanction of €30,000 euros was imposed for the infringement of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

The total fine was reduced from €80,000 to €48,000 because the controller acknowledged responsibility for the breach and agreed to pay before final resolution of the sanctioning procedure.
