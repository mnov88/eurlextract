Information and communication company fined EUR 50,000.00

The Agency received a Personal Data Breach Report (pursuant to Article 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation) from the controller, i.e. the information and communication company, stating that the personal data of the company's users were exposed by a hacker attack.

After the supervisory procedure, it was determined that the controller failed to timely implement appropriate technical security measures for the processing of personal data in relation to the existing and foreseeable risks, which could have prevented the breach or reduced the risk to the minimum possible extent. Specifically, the controller failed to protect personal data from destruction, alteration, prohibited disclosure and unauthorized access, which resulted in the attacker, once he had gained access to the system, being able to move freely throughout the entire information system, thereby completely compromising it and gaining access to the personal data of the respondents on the servers. Upon learning of the breach, the controller immediately began to resolve the security issue and, after determining all the circumstances, initiated steps to repair the entire IT system.

In this specific case, the controller made multiple failures in the design of the processing system, including appropriate corrective actions in the system. Specifically, by failing to take appropriate technical security measures for the processing of personal data in relation to ensuring the permanent confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the system, a process for regularly testing, evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of processing, and taking into account the risks posed by the processing, the risks of accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of personal data or unauthorized access to personal data by the controller, there was a violation of Article 32, paragraph 1, items b) and d) and paragraph 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

Due to the aforementioned violation of the General Data Protection Regulation, the controller was fined EUR 50,000.00.
