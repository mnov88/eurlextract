## English Summary

### Facts

10 individuals complained about the Canary Click Consulting website, who claimed to offer processing services for obtaining certain official certificates.

The individuals complained that they had to enter personal data and pay a fee in order to receive official certificates, but only received instructions on obtaining the certificates once they did this. Several complainants also stated that the company gave them no information about the storage or deletion of their data once they asked for a refund.

On their investigation, the AEPD found the following:

*   URL 1’s privacy policy stated that personal data would only be used for “strictly necessary purposes”, but also that marketing was an object of the processing. URL 1 also did not provide an option to reject cookies.
*   URLs 2, 3 and 4 had no cookie banner and no rejection mechanism in their cookie policies. When users sought to delete cookies, the URLs instructed them to “configure the browser on their terminal equipment.”

### Dispute

Were URLs 1-4 in breach of the GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held that Canary Click Consulting breached European and Spanish data protection law.

It held that URL 1 breached Article 7 of the GDPR because the users had to “generically” give their consent to all processing purposes, meaning they could not withdraw consent for specific purposes, such as marketing. For this the AEPD issued Canary Click with a warning and ordered them to bring URL 1 and their privacy policy in line with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR within a month.

The AEPD also held that URLs 1-4 breached Article 22(2) of the [Law 34/2002 (LSSI)](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2002-13758), the Spanish law implementing the e-Privacy Directive. For this, Canary Click was fined €8,000, i.e. €2,000 per URL.
