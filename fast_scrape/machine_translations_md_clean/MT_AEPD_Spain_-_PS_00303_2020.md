## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant had sent him a message thanking the successful acquisition of a new phone line he did not recognize (as he is a client of another telecommunications company) and that such message also specified that the new phone had a period of stay. Additionally, the claimant specified that he later received a document by the defendant requesting him to pay a debt he did not recognize.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests stating that it requested the payment of the phone services contracted online by the claimant, but it did not attach any evidence of his acceptance; afterwards, the defendant attached a copy of the alleged contract containing the personal data of the claimant, but with no evidence at all that he has signed nor accepted it in any manner. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have breached the lawfulness of processing principle as per article 6(1) GDPR: on the basis of the available evidences, the defendant did not take the due diligences to ensure the lawfulness of the data processing activity, and it neither proved the lawfulness of such when required by the AEPD. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) there is a negligence/intentionality by the defendant, and (iii) basic personal data have been affected\], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 60,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine, with two possible discounts based on earliness (48,000 €) and acknowledging of guiltiness (36,000€). The defendant agreed to both, so it paid 36,000 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate

and to solve this procedure.

II

      Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", says:

           “2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrective measures listed below:

(…)

b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning

when the treatment operations have infringed the provisions of this
Regulation;

(...)

d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified time frame.

(…)

i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of the
measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of the case
particular

(…) "

III

      The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of "legality, loyalty and
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/13

transparency". The precept provides:

      "1. The personal data will be:

         a) Treaties in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the
             interested (<< legality, loyalty and transparency >>); "

        Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;

      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures

      pre-contractual;

      (…) "

      The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for

the imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for

the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of

Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/13

      "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that

suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)

       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

IV

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it processed the
Claimant's personal data without having any legitimacy to do so. The
The claimant's personal data were incorporated into the information systems of

the company, without proving that it had legitimately hired,
had your consent for the collection and subsequent treatment of your
personal data, or there is any other cause that makes the treatment lawful
effected.

       Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, it remains in

questioned the diligence used by the respondent to identify the
person who made the contract on behalf of the claimant.

       Well, it follows that the claimant received an email from the claimed in the
which indicate that you have successfully purchased a mobile terminal that you do not recognize.

       In this regard, we must point out that the contracting is electronic and the
claimed does not provide proof that proves the hiring of the line \*\*\* TELEPHONE. 1.

       On the other hand, as a result of the transfer of the claim, they send a letter to the

claimant informing him that his data has not been communicated to files of
patrimonial solvency and credit, but requesting the payment of the amount owed.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/13

       Precisely, required to the claimed documents of completion of the
contracting the number \*\*\* TELEPHONE 1 and its corresponding signature, states that the

hiring was carried out online so it does not have a signature.

       Although the company states that the contract where all the data appears
claims of the claimant, this has the appearance of loyal, truthful and lawful to

Vodafone.

       It is important to highlight that, after examining the contract, it is verified that
the personal data of the claimant, their bank details, and the email "\*\*\* EMAIL.1",

which, according to the claimant, belongs to his daughter, but the defendant does not provide
evidence or any indication of the origin of the hiring (session IP) or
confirmation or electronic signature of the contract (SMS confirmation or email

one-time password, confirmation call, etc.). For that reason, not
the origin of the claimant's data can be established, nor the acceptance of the

treatment of these.

      However, and this is the essential thing, the defendant does not accredit the legitimacy to

the treatment of the claimant's data.

      Ultimately, the respondent has not provided a document or evidence
any evidence that the entity, in such a situation, had deployed the
minimum diligence required to verify that indeed your interlocutor was the one

claimed to flaunt.

      Respect for the principle of legality that is in the essence of fundamental right
protection of personal data requires that it be proven that the
responsible for the treatment displayed the essential diligence to prove that
extreme. If this Agency does not act in this way - and if this Agency does not demand it, it is incumbent upon

for compliance with the regulations governing the data protection right of
personal character - the result would be to empty the content of the principle of legality.

                                            V

        In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that indicate:

           "Each supervisory authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative under this article for the infractions of this
Regulations indicated in paragraphs 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive. "

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/13

        "Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, as an additional or substitute for the measures contemplated in the

Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administrative and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

        a) the nature, severity and duration of the offense, taking into account the
        nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
        as well as the number of affected stakeholders and the level of damage and

        damages they have suffered;

        b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

        c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
        to mitigate the damages suffered by the interested parties;

        d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge of the
        treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have

        applied by virtue of articles 25 and 32;

        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
        treatment;

         f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to
        remedy the violation and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the violation;

        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infraction and, in such
        case, to what extent;

        i) when the measures indicated in Article 58 (2) have been
        previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge

        in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;

        j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to mechanisms
        certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
        case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct

        or indirectly, through the infringement. "

      Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:

         "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
The following may also be taken into account:

  a) The continuing nature of the offense.

  b) The linking of the activity of the offender with the performance of data processing

  g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.

  h) The submission by the person in charge or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between those and any interested party. "

      In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the fine to impose
in the present case, the claimed party is considered responsible for an infringement
typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, in an initial assessment, they are considered concurrent
the following factors.

      As aggravating factors the following:

- The intentionality or negligence in the offense (article 83.2 b).

- Basic personal identifiers are affected (name, data

bank, the line identifier) (article 83.2 g).

     That is why it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to impose on the claimed and
set it at the amount of € 60,000 for the violation of article 6.1 of the RGPD.

        Therefore, based on the foregoing,

        By the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection,
