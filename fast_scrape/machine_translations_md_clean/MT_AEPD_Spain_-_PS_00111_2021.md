## English Summary

### Facts

An individual repeatedly received emails containing Vodafone invoices belonging to a third party. They tried reaching out to the company by email and telephone to resolve this issue, but were never properly helped.

Thus, they filed a complaint to the Spanish DPA (AEPD), which informed Vodafone of the issue. The company assured the DPA it had both dealt with the problem and communicated the resolution to the complainant. The complainant nonetheless kept receiving invoices. The DPA communicated this to the company, which then provided evidence the complainant's email address had been deleted from its systems. It claimed the problem was caused by the customer (that the invoices were actually intended for) entering the complainant's email address instead of their own.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA held that Vodafone Spain unlawfully processed the complainant's personal data, as the company had no lawful basis to send them invoices belonging to one of its customers. It found this to constitute a severe and negligent violation (Article 83(2)(a) and (b) GDPR) of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR, as the complainant's data was neither processed with integrity and confidentiality nor appropriately safeguarded.

It originally imposed a fine of €30,000 for the violation of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and €20,000 for the violation of Article 32 GDPR, but this was reduced to a total fine amounting to €40,000 because Vodafone Spain made use of a reduction procedure proposed by the DPA.

client had activated the notifications of sending invoices to the email account

Claimant's electronic mail, for this reason, was receiving the notices of
availability of invoices in your email.

This case has been studied in detail with those responsible for Systems and it has been

been able to find out that this error was not caused by a system failure, but
because the third customer had provided the email account of the
claimant to send the invoices. The third client has been listed as

fraudulent by the Vodafone investigation team (this having been resolved
incidence), therefore, when accessing the client area via the web, it provided an address of
email for sending invoices that turned out to be that of the claimant.

     By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 04/27/2016 on the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free

circulation of these data (hereinafter, GDPR); recognizes each authority of
control, and as established in art. 47 of Organic Law 3/2018, Protection

of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD),
the director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate

and to solve this procedure.

                                               II

The LOPGDD, in its article 5.1 indicates: "Duty of confidentiality":

"1. Those responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all
people who intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of
confidentiality referred to in article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                               III

Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD establishes that personal data will be:

"F) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate data security
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures

or appropriate organizational ("integrity and confidentiality").

And section 2 of the same article 5 states:

"2. The person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the provisions

in section 1 and able to demonstrate it (<< proactive responsibility >>).

                                               IV

Regarding the security of personal data, article 32 of the RGPD “Security
treatment ”, establishes that:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the

nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/18

physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and
appropriate organizational arrangements to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,

that in your case include, among others:

a) pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;

b) the ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience
permanent treatment systems and services;

c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data of

quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the
technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular attention will be paid to
take into account the risks presented by the data processing, in particular as

consequence of accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of data
personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data. 3. Adherence to a code of conduct

approved pursuant to Article 40 or a certification mechanism approved pursuant to
Article 42 may serve as an element to demonstrate compliance with the

requirements established in section 1 of this article. 4. The person in charge and the
data controller will take measures to ensure that any person
that acts under the authority of the person in charge or the person in charge and has access to data

personal data can only process said data following instructions from the person in charge,
unless required to do so under Union or State law
members".

                                            V

In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the

instruction, it is considered that the complainant carried out the data processing
personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so,
materialized in that they continue to receive telephone bills owned by a

third party in the claimant's email address, even though they requested
in the past the deletion of your data.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/18

It should be noted that this Agency transferred the claim made
by the claimant to the claimed, stating that the incident was already

resolved. However, the claimant continued to receive telephone bills
ownership of a third party in your email address. Consequently, it has

carried out a treatment of personal data without having proven that it has
with the legal authorization to do so.

On the other hand, there are other significant evidences for the graduation of the
infringement:

Continued nature of the facts verified: from 05/16/2019 to 01/18/2021.

Volume of the treatments carried out: an affected third party, owner of the invoices,
person who was able to enter the claimant's email address as the address
shipping, and the claimant who receives the invoices.

The development of the business activity carried out by the entity requires a
continuous processing of personal data. The entity carries out for the development of its

activity a high volume of personal data processing.

                                                SAW

The known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to the
claimed, for violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, which governs the principles of

integrity and confidentiality of the processing of personal data, as well as the
proactive responsibility of the controller to demonstrate its
compliance, as stated in section 2 of the same article 5 of the RGPD.

On the other hand, there are clear indications that the respondent has violated article
32 of the RGPD, facilitating access to information related to personal data of a

client by a third person outside the entity.

The responsibility of the claimed is determined by unauthorized access. The
entity is responsible for making decisions aimed at implementing in a

effective the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of
security appropriate to the risk to ensure the confidentiality of the data and, between

these, those aimed at restoring availability and preventing access to data in case
physical or technical incident.
