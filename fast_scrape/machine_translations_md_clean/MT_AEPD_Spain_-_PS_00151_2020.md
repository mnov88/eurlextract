## English Summary

### Facts

The defendant had installed a video surveillance system composed of four cameras in the building where he/she owns three apartments (of which two used for tourism activity), without asking for permission of the other people living in the building. These four cameras recorded data of personal character that had been incorporated into some type of computer file managed by the defendant. No information about the video surveillance was displayed in the building, leaving therefore the data subjects without notice. The surveillance system recorded every person passing without limitations.

### Dispute

Was the system put in place violating the principle of data minimization and the obligation to give information to the data subjects as per articles 5 and 13 GDPR?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA considered that the surveillance system installed was violating the minimization principle: the fact that some of the apartments in the building are dedicated to tourist activities does not legitimize the recording of the common areas, unless by agreement of the board of owners. The DPA imposed therefore a fine of €2000 for violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

Regarding the obligation to provide information to the data subjects, as there is no informational poster that informs the people affected about the data processing, the identity of the controller and the possibility of exercising their rights, there is a clear breach of the duty of information as per article 13 GDPR. The DPA imposed thus a fine of €1000 for violating Article 13 GDPR.

One of these principles is that of data minimization (article 5.1.c), which establishes the
