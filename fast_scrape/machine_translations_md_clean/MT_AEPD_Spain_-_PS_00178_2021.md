## English Summary

### Facts

A wife and a husband were both administrators of a company. During a judicial procedure between both of them, the wife sent, as the administrator of the company, a series of emails containing some documents related to the proceedings, revealing details about several alleged crimes, to other companies that had a commercial relationship with the company. The husband (as data subject) filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against the company for sharing the documents containing his personal data without consent.

### Holding

The AEPD established that the facts were a violation of the confidentiality principle, since, even if the company was authorised to process such personal data, being it involved in the judicial proceedings, it should not have shared such personal data without the data subject's consent.

Therefore, the AEPD fined the controller €2000 for a violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR"). In order to determine the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account, among other factors, the small size of the company and the limited number of data subjects affected (1), as well as the limited impact of the behaviour, since it was only local.

                                       FACTS

FIRST: On October 23, 2020, the claimant filed a claim with

FIRST: By virtue of the powers that Article 58.2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD) recognizes each

control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the Organic Law
3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Agency
Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

SECOND: Article 5 of the RGPD, whose heading is entitled “Principles relating to the
treatment ”establishes in letter f) of its section 1 that personal data will be
"Treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate data security
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures
or appropriate organizational ('integrity and confidentiality'). "

In relation to this principle, Recital 39 of the aforementioned RGPD states that:

“\[…\] Personal data must be treated in a way that guarantees security and
adequate confidentiality of personal data, including to prevent access

or unauthorized use of said data and of the equipment used in the treatment ”.

violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles relating to treatment, in relation to

personal data to third parties. The dissemination of these data by whoever was a member
and administrator of the company (with respect to whom their legitimacy is not

ciality established by the RGPD in the processing of personal data, general obligation

For the purposes of the statute of limitations for infractions, the infraction indicated in the
previous paragraph is considered very serious and prescribes after three years, according to the
Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes that:
