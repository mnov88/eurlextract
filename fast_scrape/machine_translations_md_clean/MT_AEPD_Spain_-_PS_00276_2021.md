## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) because the company’s website required user’s email address to access the website (WESTWING.ES). According to them, it was not possible to freely access the site. Moreover, the complainant indicated that analytic cookies were installed regardless of the user’s cookies’ preferences.

The company answered that WESTWING.ES is a private shopping club that only registered members can access to. Therefore, the legal basis for the processing of personal data was the necessity for the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).

The AEPD confirmed that the website was not public and that only registered members can access to it. It concluded that data subjects were duly informed about this in the website’s Privacy Policy. However, the AEPD found that the website automatically installed 11 non-identified cookies when accessing it for the first time. These cookies were not identified in the Cookies Policy, so it was not possible to classify them as necessary or not. Therefore, Spanish DPA requested the company to inform users about all cookies used on the website and to ask for consent before automatically installing any non-necessary cookie.

The company admitted that those 11 cookies were not adequately identified in their Cookies Policy. They clarified that those cookies were necessary ones, and that law did not required consent in those cases. However, for transparency reasons, they updated their cookie banner with information on the use of necessary cookies.

### Holding

The AEPD considered that the company did not infringe Article 22(2) of the Spanish Law regulating cookies and unsolicited communications (LSSI). This law permits companies to install necessary or technical cookies without users’ consent. The website only automatically installed necessary or technical cookies without users’ consent. Non-necessary cookies asked for users’ consent. Moreover, after the AEPD request, the cookie banner informed users about the use of necessary cookies. Therefore, the AEPD closed the procedure.

                RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

By means of an Agreement dated 07/07/21, the sanctioning procedure was initiated, PS /
0276/2021, instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection to the entity,
WW E-SERVICES IBERIA, S.L.U. ("WESTWING"), with CIF .: B65732984, holder of the
website, www.westwing.es, (hereinafter, "the claimed party"), by virtue of the
Claim presented by D.A.A.A., for alleged infringement of Law 34/2002, of 11

July, Services of the Information Society and Electronic Commerce (LSSI),
and based on the following:

                                   BACKGROUND

FIRST: On 01/15/21, a letter from

"When accessing the website www.westwing.es for the first time, after accepting the

SECOND: On 03/08/21, this Agency sent a request
informative to the claimed party, in accordance with the provisions of article 65.4
of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the protection of personal and legal data
rantía of digital rights, ("LOPDGDD").

THIRD: On 04/08/21, this Agency received a written reply to the

Request made to the claimed party, in which, among others, it is reported:

"In this case we have no evidence that the interested party has presented directly

they only need to provide an email address and password),

emerging senators. For this, WESTWING is committed to providing each
day to the members of your Shopping Club exclusive offers, for a very short time,

in campaigns of very short duration and with a limited number of products. How is it
Obviously, so that WESTWING can fulfill the services offered and contracted
by its users, it is necessary to promptly inform the members of the Shopping
Club of the flash campaigns it launches, which it carries out by sending via
newsletters via email. Therefore, given the nature of the service offered, in
its general conditions WESTWING undertakes to provide its customers

information related to different products, whether owned or from collaborated third parties-
res, and facilitate access to them by acquiring them under the conditions
offered on the WEB, through the established contracting procedure (all
this jointly referred to as the "SERVICES") ".

For this purpose, it is only possible to access the private shopping club "after acquiring
sition of membership "and" The offers of WESTWING.ES are not free
access, but are reserved solely and exclusively for its members "." In these
conditions, WESTWING provides information about various products, pro-
pios or third parties, offering its members the possibility of acquiring through

As you can see, so that WESTWING can fulfill these commitments and

provide users with the services they request from their Shopping Club, including
thus pleading its own general contracting conditions.

Guided by a criterion of maximum prudence and respect for the will of the users,
at the time of requesting registration in the Shopping Club, users are asked

Thus, even when the sending of these informative bulletins is protected on the basis of
treatment provided for in art. 6.1.b) of the RGPD, as it is the way in which WES-
TWING provides the services it offers in accordance with its general conditions, by

informative of the Shopping Club, or reducing the frequency with which you want to receive it,
thus exempting WESTWING from its commitment to provide you with information about

the offers of your Shopping Club, reducing them to the establishment and use of a store
online, accessible when the user wishes. This allows the member who
want to minimize your contact or interaction with the Shopping Club so you can establish it
cer, so that the user in question is the one who delimits the scope of the services
provided by WESTWING and, consequently, the processing of your personal data-

them. In this way, we provide greater information and security to the client, guaranteeing
thus giving the users absolute freedom and the maximum attention to their interests.

Shortly after the entry into force of the RGPD, on 05/25/2018), in January
2019 Westwing received a request for information from the supervisory authority
competent German (Bayerisches Landesamtfúr Datenschutzaufsicht— BayLDA -),

in which you were asked to inform about the registration process in your Shopping
Club. This request was met by the company's legal advisers, ex-
asking the supervisory authority that the basis of treatment in question was art.
6.1.b) of the GDPR, given that, among other things, "Westwing's obligation goes beyond
of the mere making available of the closed area for members.

The offer on www.westwína.de is a shopping club or a ”shopping magazine”

disciplinary proceedings or direct any other action regarding WESTWING, with
which we understand validated our interpretation of the GDPR, applicable throughout the
UE, and the registration system of our Shopping Club. Therefore, not showing the self-

control no non-conformity with our registration system or with the transaction

so that the inadmissibility for processing of the received claim is agreed. Nevertheless,

of cooperation with the AEPD already stated, we would like to point out that, in case of

of the AEPD ”.

access web content. This emerging wall also allows the option of giving

FIFTH: On 07/07/21, by the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency

article 22.2) of the LSSI, punishable in accordance with the provisions of art. 39) and 40) of
