## English Summary

### Facts

On an unspecified date, a logistics firm (controller) notified the Romanian DPA of two data breaches in line with [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"). Following the notifications, the DPA launched an investigation which concluded that the security breaches were caused by the theft of a bookshelf containing the files of 12 employees. The theft allowed unauthorised third parties access the personal data contained therein. The breach occurred on 3 June 2021 and included data concerning contact information, academic and professional training, employment details, information on tax deductions and dependents, and employees' health status. The DPA concluded the investigation in December 2022.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk generated in particular by the destruction, loss, modification, unauthorised disclosure or unauthorised access to personal data. Hence, the controller violated Articles 32(1)(b) and 32(2) GDPR.

Pursuant to its [Article 58(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2 "Article 58 GDPR") statutory powers, the DPA ordered the controller to implement corrective measures and to review and update the technical and organisational measures implemented as a result of the risk assessment, including the work procedures related to the protection of personal data, as well as to carry out a training for all individuals authorised to process personal data.

The DPA fined the controller 9,828.00 lei (ca. €2000) for its violation.
