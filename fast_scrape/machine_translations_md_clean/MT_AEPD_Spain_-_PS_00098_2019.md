## English Summary

### Facts

A citizen had to give his personal details, as well as his daughter’s personal details when filling the official form aimed at authorizing underage children travelling (“travel permit”) provided by the Directorate-General of the Spanish Civil Guard. While completing the travel permit with the personal data required, the citizen noticed that no information was given regarding the collection of personal data, and the purposes of the processing, or about the recipients. The citizen – the complainant – filed a complaint with the AEPD claiming the unlawfulness due to the lack of information concerning personal data required, under Article 13 GDPR.

### Dispute

Does the travel permit form provide for the mandatory information, as foreseen by Article 13 GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD ruled that the form used to allow underage children travelling did not provide the mandatory information, as required by Article 13 GDPR.

As a consequence, the AEPD issued a reprimand to the Directorate-General of the Spanish Civil Guard for the violation of Article 13 GDPR.
