## English Summary

### Facts

An employee of a real estate agency (controller) was fired after refusing to follow the orders of his employers. The controller had asked him to take photos and videos of the mailboxes of the owners of the properties the controller was engaged with in order to build a database. The information collected would have been comprised of the street, block number, floor, and the names of the residents in the property. The controller was not intending to ask for consent for this processing, and after refusing to comply, citing data protection concerns, the employee was fired.

The employee filed a complaint with the AEPD (Spanish DPA) on 9 May 2023.

During the investigation, the controller had tried to argue that they had not asked the employee to take such photos, but the employee provided extracts of a conversation over text which demonstrated that they had.

The controller also submitted that the source of the information came from a public directory and not, as alleged, the taking of photos of mailboxes by their employees.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller had infringed [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"). The DPA rejected the controller’s claims of having sourced the information from a public directory, reasoning that such directory does not include the floor number of the apartments, as was present in the controller’s database.

The DPA also found that the controller had infringed [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR") in failing to provide transparent information to the data subject where their data has not been obtained from them, as the data subjects were not informed their data would be included in the database.

In determining the appropriate sanction, the DPA was influenced by the fact that the processing operation in question was not isolated in nature (it seemed to be standard practice at the organisation) and the significant extent of the negligence present in the controller’s actions.

The DPA initially set the fine at €20,000 but pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €12,000.

 File No.: EXP202308051

RESOLUTION TERMINATING THE PROCEDURE FOR RECOGNITION OF LIABILITY AND VOLUNTARY PAYMENT

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On February 7, 2025, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against ESTUDIO ALCAZAR

DEL GENIL 2022, S.L. (hereinafter, ESTUDIO ALCAZAR), through the agreement transcribed below:

<<
File No.: EXP202308051

AGREEMENT TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Regarding the actions taken by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following

FACTS

FIRST: On May 9, 2023, a complaint was filed with the Spanish Data Protection Agency for a possible infringement attributable to ESTUDIO

ALCAZAR DEL GENIL 2022, S.L. with Tax Identification Number (NIF) B09971029 (hereinafter, ESTUDIO
ALCAZAR).

The facts brought to the attention of this authority were:

The complainant states that he was an employee of ESTUDIO ALCAZAR and that, on April 25, 2023, his superiors gathered his employees and urged them to take photos and videos of the mailboxes of the Homeowners' Associations of the properties they visited to compile a database, without obtaining the consent of the data subjects and without informing them of this. Specifically, he states that they had to provide the following information: the street, the block number, and the names that appeared on the mailboxes, along with the floor and door where the individuals reside. He claims that, after refusing to carry out this action, which he considers contrary to data protection regulations, he was fired.

Along with the written document, the following was submitted:

- A screenshot of the WhatsApp conversation with the phone number \*\*\*TELÉFONO.1 and the date April 26, 2024, where the following messages appear at 2:50 p.m.: “A.A.A. I need to talk to you. If you

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/34

have a second, I'll call you.” The name of the contact with whom the conversation is taking place, which appears on the claimant's cell phone, is:
“B.B.B.”

- Video in .mp4 format of the conversation held on April 26, 2023, at 2:52 p.m., between the complainant and the telephone number
\*\*\*TELEPHONE.1, in which they communicated the company's intention to terminate their services based on their refusal to collect data
from potential clients. The following information can be extracted from the conversation:

\[…\] B.B.B.: Look, sorry, son, I don't have much coverage. Let's see, A.A.A., I've been thinking about what we talked about, \[…\] I didn't want to

drag it out much longer, but nothing, we've been talking with C.C.C. and D.D.D. because they are also partners in the company \[…\] Right now,

it's the only way we have to establish a zone, and I'm sorry,

we can't reach any other agreement \[…\] I wanted to let you know that we have to terminate you \[…\].

A.A.A.: But B.B.B., I understand, but you understand that what you asked me to do,
to take photos of mailboxes, is illegal.
B.B.B.: A.A.A., photos, write it down, whatever, I can't do anything else, son, this is about three people, not just one. I can understand your position, but we can't do anything else, A.A.A.
I can't demand that my colleagues do one thing and that you do another. This is the way we operate the area now, and we can't do anything else.
A.A.A.: But B.B.B., you shouldn't ask anyone to do that,
to take photos of the mailboxes.

B.B.B.: Well, A.A.A. That's what I told you. This depends on...
We have the legal department, and that's up to them.
That's it.
A.A.A.: Well, that's it, perfect if it's your decision.
B.B.B.: Of course, that's it.

B.B.B.: \[…\] the thing is that A.A.A.: we have no other way of working, and I know that
you obviously don't agree, that this isn't legal. You've informed yourself, which seems great, but we just can't do anything else."

- Telephone numbers of the participants in the conversation of which the video has been provided:

o Origin of the call: \*\*\*TELEPHONE.1.

o Destination of said call: \*\*\*TELEPHONE.2.

o Date: April 26, 2023, at approximately 2:55 p.m.

- Photographs of mailboxes that have been uploaded to the database of
\*\*\*COMPANY.5, which include the following names and door numbers:

(…)

SECOND: In accordance with Pursuant to Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), this complaint was forwarded to ESTUDIO ALCAZAR, so that it could analyze it and inform this Agency within one month of the actions taken to comply with the requirements set forth in the data protection regulations. On July 13, 2023, this Agency received a response letter from
ESTUDIO ALCAZAR, stating the following:

“(…) FIRST.- Estudio Alcázar del Genil 2022 SL. hired the claimant, in accordance with the applicable agreement and salary, as a SALES PERSON, that is, for the actual sale of homes (sale, acquisition, commercial area, etc.). The contract lasted only a month and a half, but IN NO CASE did this company propose/suggest/force/instruct this worker, or anyone else, to do what was stated in the prior complaint. Not because this party claims so in its defense, but because it is not the company's practice or standard, especially when the brand \*\*\*EMPRESA.5 also has internal software/application containing the databases whose consent has been lawfully obtained and which are used, where necessary, at the time of the contract. of
promoting and selling the homes; all of this, always with the prior interest that
the client shows in the home in question (which is different from stating that the
company is looking for buyers or sellers left and right by calling a

phone number or similar to see if they will sell or buy a home).
Likewise, Estudio Alcázar del Genil 2022 S.L. is a company that, since
it was established, HAS NOT RECEIVED A SINGLE COMPLAINT (NEITHER REGARDING DATA PROTECTION OR ANY OTHER KIND), CLAIM, OR NEGATIVE REVIEW
but quite the opposite, especially when operating in a neighborhood of
\*\*\*LOCALITY.1 (it operates by zones so as not to "step on" the other franchises of the brand

operating in the city) that is "small," and that, in a market
like this, doing it poorly is synonymous with... Unfortunately, not selling, and therefore, being doomed to business failure.”

THIRD: On August 9, 2023, in accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD (General Data Protection Act), the claim was admitted for processing.

FOURTH: The Subdirectorate General of Data Inspection proceeded to carry out preliminary investigations to clarify the facts in question, pursuant to the functions assigned to supervisory authorities in Article 57.1 and the powers granted in Article 58.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and in accordance with the provisions of Title VIII of the LOPDGDD.

As a result of the actions taken, the following matters have been brought to our attention:

OUTCOME OF THE ACTIONS INVESTIGATION

(…) On December 22, 2023, \*\*\*COMPANY.6 responded to this agency
confirming that on April 26, 2023, at 2:52:15 p.m.,
a call was made from number \*\*\*TELEPHONE.1 to number \*\*\*TELEPHONE.2 lasting
334 seconds, or 5 minutes and 34 seconds. It reports that
the owner of the destination line is: E.E.E. with DNI \*\*\*NIF.1 and address at
\*\*\*ADDRESS.1.

The claimant provided \*\*\*TELEPHONE.2 as their
phone number in the claim.

On December 29, 2023, \*\*\*COMPANY.7 responded to this agency's request, confirming that on April 26, 2023, at 2:52:16 PM, a call was made from number \*\*\*TELEPHONE.1 to number
\*\*\*TELEPHONE.2, lasting 332 seconds. It also reports the ownership of line \*\*\*TELEPHONE.1, which corresponds to F.F.F., with ID number: \*\*\*NIF.2
and address: \*\*\*ADDRESS.2.

(…) On April 1, 2024, a response was received from ESTUDIO ALCAZAR, in response to this Agency's request, in which:

1. It states that its company is the Controller of customer data.

2. Provides the franchise transfer agreement to which it was subrogated (since it had initially been signed by a different company), signed

between \*\*\*COMPANY.8, Estudio Alcázar, and \*\*\*COMPANY.1, effective June 1, 2022.

3. States that: "Only clients and data whose consent has been previously obtained and duly legalized are used. This company does not carry out practices such as the one referred to in
the complaint made by G.G.G.."

4. It is conducting, and will document before the end of the year, a
data protection audit and a CORPORATE COMPLIANCE audit, which will be provided when completed.

5. Does not respond to the request for:

 Record of processing activities carried out under its responsibility (Art. 30 of the GDPR).

 Purposes and legal grounds for processing activities
(Art. 6 GDPR).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/34

 Data processor contract(s) signed by that company.

 Origin of the personal data of potential clients.

 Data protection audit reports and "CORPORATE COMPLIANCE" referred to in the aforementioned response of July 13, 2023, regarding the processing for which information is requested.

On April 30, 2024, a response was received from \*\*\*COMPANY.1 stating:

“The companies of \*\*\*COMPANY.2 act as data processors
in relation to the personal data of end customers, including potential customers, for whom the respective franchisee entities are responsible.”

\[…\] “\*\*\*COMPANY.1's intervention is limited to making customer management software (a CRM) available to franchisees so that each franchisee, at its discretion, can use it to carry out its business.”
\[…\] “The data flow basically begins when an interested party requests real estate brokerage services from one of our franchisees.

Generally, but not obligatorily, franchisees upload the data to the customer management software (CRM) provided by \*\*\*COMPANY.2 to franchisees as part of the franchise agreement.
It should be noted that each franchisee only has access to the personal data of its clients or potential clients, and all data is not shared between franchisees through the CRM. In other words, sharing the same software provider does not imply that data is shared with all users of that software.”

Finally, and although we believe it is not the subject of this procedure, we only indicate that \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 manages the website \*\*\*URL.1.

This website acts as a real estate portal. Thus, when a website user is interested in a property or a geographical area in which to purchase or sell a property, we refer said "lead" (potential interested party) to the corresponding franchisee, who act as independent data controllers.

\[…\] "31. We do not provide instructions to franchisees on how they should incorporate this data into the CRM or how they should obtain it.
This is the responsibility of each franchisee as the data controller.

32. At \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, we only explain to franchisees how the CRM works. Regarding privacy, we inform you that the
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

CRM has a tab to upload the document related to data protection, as well as another tab to indicate whether you have consent to send electronic commercial communications.

Attached is a generic "Personal Data Processing Agreement within the framework of the Franchise Agreement," dated June 1, 2022, which states:

"The FRANCHISOR will act as the FRANCHISEE's data processor with respect to the personal data of End Customers in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the GDPR (the "Data Processing Agreement").

The FRANCHISOR will act as (sub)processor of the FRANCHISEE, who will act as the controller or processor, as the case may be, of the processing, categories of personal data, and data subjects in relation to the Data Processing Order specified in Appendix A.

In Appendix A, under "Nature and purpose of processing," the following are marked: "Structuring, Storage, Consultation, Deletion, Conservation, Registration, and Other: Any other purposes necessary for the proper management and use of the CRM by the FRANCHISEE."

Under "Categories of data subjects," the categories "Customers" and "Potential customers" are marked.

Under "Type of personal data," the following are marked: "Name/surname, Address, Email, Bank details, ID/NIE/Passport, Nationality, and Other: Any other personal data necessary for the proper management and use of the CRM by the FRANCHISEE." franchisee, as well as for the proper service to End Customers, such as, for example, owned homes/premises, rental homes/premises, or real estate, financing, or any other interests related to the services provided to End Customers."

In the inspection on November 20, 2024, at the headquarters of \*\*\*COMPANY.1
at: \*\*\*ADDRESS.3, the inspection report of which was incorporated into the file in

the "Inspection Report Proceedings (...)" of December 11, 2024, the company's representatives stated:

1. "The entity is a franchisor company that does not carry out commercial activities

or process customer data, nor does it have any commercial establishments on the street.

2. What they offer are franchise contracts to real estate operators,

they offer them the brand, training, commercial consulting, exclusive territorial rights, and
a computer platform (CRM) called \*\*\*PLATFORM.1. New franchisees are also offered commercial consulting on how

they can start their business and begin selling.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/34

3. A In exchange, they receive a fixed royalty independent of the transactions carried out by the franchisees.

4. Each franchisee is an independent real estate operator, also independent of the franchisor.

5. The company does not exercise control over customer data or the contacts registered by franchisees, only over the purchase and sale transactions carried out, without including personal data in them.

6. In order to resolve technical incidents, they can access the customer database, which is the responsibility of each franchisee.

7. CRM backup work is also performed, although the frequency and location of the servers are unknown. \[…\]

After requesting to connect to the respondent's database in
\*\*\*LOCATION.1, it is found that in the database \*\*\*PLATFORM.2”

of \*\*\*COMPANY.5, there is (Doc 9) a record corresponding to
“H.H.H.” from the street “\*\*\*ADDRESS.4” as a client of “\*\*\*COMPANY.9” of the respondent's Real Estate CRM (Customer Management Program). This file only includes the client's first name, last name, address, and date of last contact:
“07/30/2024,” and does not contain a phone number or email address. The “Privacy” box states: “Pending written privacy request.”

The “Source” field states: “Source type: Internal collaborator, Source detail: B.B.B., Source category: Direct Management \[…\] System data (…) by
B.B.B. 04/25/2023. 04:42 PM. Last modified by J.J.J. 07/30/2024. 12:06 PM.”

Doc 13 lists the client “L.L.L.” without phone number or email, with

creation date: 04/11/2017.

Doc 16 lists the client "M.M.M." without phone number or email, with
creation date: 11/19/2024, and the client "N.N.N...." without phone number or email, with
creation date: 7/7/2015.

On December 4, 2024, a response was received from \*\*\*COMPANY.1 to the
requirements of this Agency, as recorded in the inspection report.

The "Personal Data Processing Agreement within the Framework of the Franchise Agreement" contract template states:

"Within the framework of the Processing order, the FRANCHISEE authorizes the FRANCHISOR to contract, on its behalf and on its behalf, with the commercial companies of \*\*\*COMPANY.2, the services of personal data processing, technical management, statistics, consulting, training, and website development for the purposes of the provisions of this agreement and the franchise agreement.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/34

Furthermore, the FRANCHISOR may, without prior authorization from the FRANCHISEE, subcontract auxiliary and standardized services to third parties for the normal operation of corporate operations, even if this entails (sub)processing of the personal data subject to this Processing order.

Any other subcontracting by the FRANCHISOR that involves (sub)processing of the personal data subject to this processing order will require the FRANCHISEE's prior authorization. The subcontractor, who will also be the data processor, is also obliged to comply with the obligations established in this document for the data processor. It is the responsibility of the
FRANCHISOR to regulate the new relationship so that the new manager is subject to the same conditions (instructions,
obligations, security measures) and the same formal requirements as the franchisee, regarding the proper processing of personal data and the

guarantee of the rights of the affected individuals."

Regarding the requirement "Detailed explanation of how a client's data appears in the area management tables, indicating the
circumstances that cause it to be included in each of them," it states:

"The purpose of processing the data that appears in the "Area Management" table is to manage commercial prospecting to obtain sales/rental orders for properties in the area under the jurisdiction of
each franchisee company" \[…\]

"In the fourth view, WEAK RELATIONSHIP QUALITY (DISPERSION - NEVER AND

>90), the properties that do not have any associated commercial prospecting activity will appear, as well as those properties in which the last commercial prospecting activity commercial prospecting has been going on for more than 90 days.” \[…\]

“The main objective, as already indicated, being to identify properties that can be sold or rented in the franchisee's area of competence.

The first view—ACQUISITION POTENTIAL (FREQUENT MONITORING) and second—HIGH QUALITY RELATIONSHIP (FRIENDS IN THE AREA) are used to show those properties where the potential for obtaining a sales contract is greatest, either because reliable information is already available regarding the interest in selling/renting a particular property (first view), or (second view) to show those properties that, if offered for sale/rent, news of this interest could reach the franchisee without the need for frequent monitoring of the property.

The third view—MEDIUM QUALITY RELATIONSHIP (<90 DAYS) and fourth view—WEAK QUALITY RELATIONSHIP (DISPERSION—NEVER AND >90) show those properties for which the franchisee could Consider conducting an active information search periodically to determine whether owners are interested in selling/renting their property (as already stated, the franchisee always limits themselves to searching for properties in the same area), depending on the volume of properties already being commercially managed or whether they are already being brokered directly. If the franchisee has a sufficient property portfolio appropriate to its commercial capacity, commercial prospecting could be temporarily halted or slowed down (it should be noted that franchisee companies are characterized by having small property portfolios that they work on intensively). Considering the above, and with the aim of supporting commercial management or prospecting, the platform proposes that it may be advisable for the period between obtaining one piece of information and the next to not exceed 90 days. However, this is a guideline that the franchisee may or may not follow; that is, it is an aid to the commercial management of the properties.

Therefore, in the fourth view, properties appear on which no information has ever been obtained, or on which the last information was obtained more than 90 days ago. However, if information is received on any of the properties appearing in the fourth view, the aforementioned property would automatically be moved, depending on the type of information obtained, to one of the other views, disappearing from the fourth view. It could also happen, among other things, that a property that appears today in view 3, after a period of time without receiving information, is moved to view 4, all of which does not affect the "quality of the data" in any way \[...\]

5. When a user creates an account on \*\*\*URL.1, who is responsible for
processing the data collected in that form?

Regarding the processing of the data necessary to create an "account" or personal page on the domain "\*\*\*URL.1," through which the

user can save information about properties marketed by the franchised companies that may be of interest to them, as well as "searches" for them (based on different search criteria), the
controller is \*\*\*COMPANY.1.

6. Where is the customer database for the

franchises of \*\*\*COMPANY.5 physically hosted?

The CRM database "\*\*\*COMPANY.3", through which each franchisee company manages its clients, is located in Frankfurt, Germany (the "area management" views belong to the CRM "\*\*\*COMPANY.3").

7. What is their relationship with "\*\*\*COMPANY.4"?

There is a contractual relationship between "\*\*\*COMPANY.4" (with registered office in Italy) and "\*\*\*COMPANY.1" (with registered office in Spain), the purpose of which is to assign the former to the latter the use of the "\*\*\*COMPANY.5" trademark for its exploitation in Spain, among other countries.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/34

The "Proceedings on creating a web account for \*\*\*COMPANY.5" dated November 19, 2024, shows the information obtained when creating an account on the website "\*\*\*URL.1". The data controller who presents the privacy policy (automatic translation from Italian using Google's automatic translator: https://translate.google.es) is "\*\*\*EMPRESA.4".

On December 9, 2024, the administrator of the company ESTUDIO ALCAZAR responded to this Agency's request. Regarding the information held by "H.H.H." states:

“H.H.H. is not a client of the company. However, in order to be diligent with

this administration, and to make available to you all information that
could be relevant to the investigation, we inform you that the only
information the company has about this gentleman is his first and
last name, and his postal address, which are entered in the database (\*\*\*PLATFORM.1) as a potential client, more

specifically as a prospect, since the agent of \*\*\*COMPANY.5, when registering his data, considered that he was a person who
could potentially be interested in our services, but that as of the date of writing
this document, he has not yet been contacted.

2. Source of this client's information.

The data of this potential client comes from a public directory
\*\*\*URL.2. This directory is a publicly accessible source, which, in accordance
with the privacy policy published on the website, is committed to meeting and exceeding the data protection standards established in the General Data Protection Regulation.

Furthermore, this policy indicates that the information published on
\*\*\*URL.2 comes from: a) public sources and directories; b)
users of \*\*\*URL.2, when publishing information they consider relevant to their personal information.

Therefore, as this is an entity that publicly declares that it complies with data protection regulations, that the data it processes is public and/or provided directly by the data subject (as appears to be the case when the portal indicates that the data subject completed a registration process before publishing this data), and that, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been sanctioned by the data protection supervisory authority to date, we consider it to be a legitimate source of data.

Finally, it should be noted that this directory contains additional data beyond this gentleman's
name, surname, and postal address. However, the agent at the \*\*\*EMPRESA.5 office, in compliance with the data minimization principle and ensuring the quality of the data in our information systems, only recorded in \*\*\*PLATAFORMA.1
the data that was strictly necessary to make initial contact with the potential client.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/34

Specifically, the agent at the \*\*\*EMPRESA.5 office attempted to contact the potential client in person at their postal address on two

occasions; in January and June 2024, both times without success.

We would like to inform you that, in accordance with the usual procedure we follow in these cases, the data is deleted after three unsuccessful contact attempts.

In order to document the above, we attach the following evidence to this document:
● Document 1. Screenshot of the data recorded on the \*\*\*URL.2 website as of November 28, 2024.
● Document 2. Evidence of the data recorded in the company's database (\*\*\*PLATFORM.1).
● Document 3. Evidence of the record of contact attempts made.
\[…\]

Following our standard procedure, the agent of \*\*\*EMPRESA.5, in order to comply with the duty to inform the data subject about the processing of their personal data, and to comply with the principles of loyalty and transparency, when collecting personal data of a potential client from a publicly accessible source, provides the data subject with the information set forth in Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation, within a reasonable period of time, and in any case: a) within one month of obtaining the personal data, b) or in the first communication with the data subject, in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of this provision and the provisions of the guide to the duty to inform published by the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

However, in accordance with the above, in this case, given that no further contact information is available, this initial communication has not taken place, as it has not been possible to establish initial contact with the potential client, and for this reason, information on the processing of their personal data has not yet been provided.

In this case, providing information on the processing of their personal data to the data subject in such a way that the data controller can keep evidence of it has been impossible, as it would require processing additional data beyond that strictly necessary for the purpose of the processing.

In this sense, the company has no way of accessing additional data that would allow it to comply with this requirement, as it requires face-to-face contact, which has not been carried out.

Furthermore, we consider it relevant to highlight that, if it had these data, the company would be violating the data minimization principle.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/34

However, the controller has adopted appropriate measures to protect the rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests of the data subject, as required by Article 14.5 of the GDPR, when these circumstances arise."

"\*\*\*EMPRESA.1 has not contracted any ancillary and standardized services that involve the processing or (sub)processing of personal data related to the processing assignment with franchisees. In any case, we can inform the Agency that the company \*\*\*EMPRESA.10, which provides technology services to the group of companies and franchisee networks, is the company that has contracted the auxiliary technological products and solutions that are necessary for the normal operation of the information technology services. and the communication services it provides, contracted through user licenses, such as

for example, from \*\*\*COMPANY.3.”

\[…\] \*\*\*COMPANY.1 has a single subcontracting agreement related to the data processing order between the franchisor and the franchisee, the purpose of which is the provision of services related to the CRM “\*\*\*COMPANY.3”, acting as the subcontracted company \*\*\*COMPANY.10

LEGAL BASIS

I

Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) to each supervisory authority and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

II
Procedure

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary manner, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

In accordance with Article 64 of the LOPDGDD, and taking into account the characteristics of the alleged violations committed, a sanctioning procedure is initiated.

The procedure will last a maximum of twelve months from the date of the initiation agreement. After this period, the procedure will expire and, consequently, the proceedings will be closed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 64 of the LOPDGDD.

If no objections are made to this initial agreement within the stipulated period, it may be considered a proposed resolution, as established in Article 64.2.f) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP).

III
Preliminary Questions

Article 4.1) of the GDPR defines "personal data" as:

"any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("the data subject"); an identifiable natural person shall be any person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that person."

Article 4.2 of the GDPR defines "processing" as:

"any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or

sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as
collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or
alteration, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or

any other form of making available, alignment or interconnection, restriction, erasure or destruction."

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the GDPR, personal data processing is established, since ESTUDIO ALCAZAR carries out, among other processing, the collection and storage of personal data of natural persons, such as: first and last name, telephone number, address, and email address, among others.

Article 4.7 of the GDPR defines "controller" or "controller":

"the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing; where the purposes and means of processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be laid down by Union or Member State law."

Article 4.7 of the GDPR defines "controller" or "controller":
8) "processor" or "processor":

"the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller."

ESTUDIO ALCAZAR carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, as it determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to

Article 4.7 of the GDPR.

On April 1, 2024, ESTUDIO ALCAZAR received a response to this Agency's request, stating that its company is the data controller for customer data.

On April 30, 2024, a response was received from \*\*\*COMPANY.1 stating:

“The companies of \*\*\*COMPANY.2 act as data processors in relation to the personal data of end customers, including potential customers, for which the respective franchisees are responsible.”

Likewise, \*\*\*COMPANY.1 provided the generic "Personal Data Processing Agreement within the framework of the Franchise Agreement," dated June 1, 2022, which stated:

"The FRANCHISOR shall act as the FRANCHISEE's data processor with respect to the personal data of End Customers in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the GDPR (the "Data Processing Agreement").

The FRANCHISOR shall act as the (sub)processor of the FRANCHISEE, who shall act as the controller or processor, as the case may be, for the processing, categories of personal data, and data subjects in relation to the Data Processing Agreement specified in Appendix A."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/34

Consequently, if the violation alleged in this resolution is confirmed during the investigation, the alleged responsible party who may be held administratively liable for the alleged violations committed is ESTUDIO ALCAZAR, as the controller of the personal data.

IV
Unfulfilled obligation. Lawfulness of Processing

The first paragraph of Article 6 of the GDPR states the following:

"1. Processing shall only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:

a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the data controller;
d) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;

f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. of the data subject that require protection of personal data, particularly when the data subject is a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions. "

In this case, it is necessary to examine whether ESTUDIO ALCAZAR has a lawful basis for processing the personal data contained in the mailboxes of the Homeowners' Associations of the properties visited by ESTUDIO ALCAZAR employees.

Article 6 of the GDPR, regarding the "Lawfulness of Processing," determines in its section 1 the cases in which the regulations permit the processing of personal data of a third party, which are referred to as "lawful bases." If any of these cases or conditions are not met, the processing will not be legitimate, or considered lawful by the GDPR.

In the present case, the complainant states that, on April 25, 2023,

his superiors gathered the ESTUDIO ALCAZAR employees, urging them to take photos and videos of the mailboxes of the Homeowners' Associations of the properties. that they visited to compile a database, without obtaining the consent of the data subjects.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 18/34

The complainant provides evidence that ESTUDIO ALCAZAR had made such a request to its employees. Specifically, in the

conversation held on April 26, 2023, between the complainant and the
phone number of his supervisor at ESTUDIO ALCAZAR, the following
information is extracted:

“A.A.A.: But B.B.B., I understand, but you understand that what you asked me to do about taking photos of mailboxes is illegal.

B.B.B.: A.A.A., take photos, write them down, whatever, I can't do anything else, son, this is about three people, not just one. I can understand your position, but we can't do anything else, A.A.A.
I can't demand that colleagues do one thing, that you do another. This is the way we operate the area now, and we can't do anything else.

A.A.A.: But B.B.B., you shouldn't ask anyone to Do that,
take photos of the mailboxes.
B.B.B.: Well, A.A.A. That's what I told you, this depends on...
We have the legal department, and that's up to them.
That's it."

In this conversation, the supervisor expressly acknowledges that this practice
was being carried out by the workers and that it was part of the
methodology implemented for area management. Furthermore, in response to the complainant's objection to the legality of the practice, the supervisor does not deny its existence nor

provide a justification based on a legal basis in accordance with Article 6.1 of the
GDPR, but simply refers any questions about its validity to the "legal department."

Furthermore, three photographs of different mailboxes are provided and it is stated that they

have been uploaded to the \*\*\*COMPANY.5 database. Among other details, the following
name, surname, and door number appear: H.H.H.

In the investigation activities carried out by this Agency at the headquarters of
\*\*\*COMPANY.5, recorded in the Inspection Report of November 20, 2024, a record was found for "H.H.H." of the street "\*\*\*ADDRESS.4" as a client of "\*\*\*COMPANY.9" in the Real Estate CRM (Customer Management Program) of ESTUDIO ALCAZAR, which only includes the first name, last name, address, and date of last contact: "07/30/2024." The "Source" field in the CRM shows: "Source Type: Internal Collaborator, Source Detail: B.B.B., Source Category: Direct Management
\[…\] System Data (…) by B.B.B. 4/25/2023. 4:42 PM Last modified by J.J.J.

7/30/2024. 12:06 PM."

The source of this information appears in \*\*\*PLATFORM.1 as "Internal Collaborator" and "Direct Management." The date April 25, 2023, which appears as the record's creation, is the day before the call the complainant states he received from the real estate agency director.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/34

The defendant states in its written submissions that the source of the information is the "public directory \*\*\*URL.2." However, said directory does not include the apartment number, as it appears in the \*\*\*PLATAFORMA.1 database.

Given the circumstances, it is understood that ESTUDIO ALCAZAR has collected the names, surnames, and addresses from the mailboxes of the Homeowners' Associations (AEPD) of the properties to create a database without obtaining the consent of the data subjects for its processing. This constitutes unlawful processing of personal data.

Therefore, based on the evidence currently available regarding the initiation of sanctioning proceedings, it is considered that the known facts could constitute a procedural violation arising from the collection and storage of data from the mailboxes of community owners without any legal basis for doing so, attributable to ESTUDIO ALCAZAR, due to a violation of the article transcribed above. V

Classification of the violation of Article 6.1 of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of limitation

Article 83.5 of the GDPR classifies the violation of the following articles as an administrative violation, which shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, by administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, by an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

"a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9;"

For its part, the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data) in its Article 71, Infractions, states that:

“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements.”

For the sole purpose of the statute of limitations, Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD establishes the following:

"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 20/34

b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing established in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 being met."

VI
Proposed sanction for infringement of Article 6 of the GDPR

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:
a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the

nature, the scope or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;
b) the intentionality or negligence of the breach;
c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects;
d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous breaches committed by the controller or processor;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate any adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;
h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent;

(i) where the measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures; (j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42; and (k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD

provides:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 21/34

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:
a) The continuous nature of the infringement.
b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.

c) The benefits obtained as a result of committing the infringement.
d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have Inducing the commission of the violation.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the violation, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.

f) The violation of the rights of minors.
g) Having, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.
h) Voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential violation, especially considering the consequences its commission has on those affected, a fine would be appropriate, in addition to the adoption of measures, if applicable.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR.

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available in the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions.

First, it is deemed that the following circumstances exist:

- The nature, severity, and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered (Article 83.2, letter a) of the GDPR). The severity of the breach in this case is evident in the fact that such conduct is not an isolated case, but rather, from the conversation provided by the complainant, it is evident that this is a common practice carried out by the respondent to collect personal data.

- Intentionality/Negligence in the infringement (Article 83.2, letter b) of the GDPR):

The existence of gross negligence can be determined from the conversation
between the complainant and his supervisor at ESTUDIO ALCAZAR. The latter expressly acknowledges that this practice was part of the methodology
implemented for zone management and, in response to the complainant's objection to the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 22/34

legality of the practice, the supervisor does not deny its existence, but simply refers any questions about its validity to the "legal sector."

Likewise, the following grading factors are considered aggravating factors:

- The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (Article 76.2, letter b) of the LOPDGDD): The evident connection between ESTUDIO ALCAZAR's business activity and the processing of personal data. ESTUDIO ALCAZAR's activity as a real estate agency involves the processing of personal data of clients, owners, and tenants, including identifying, financial, and contractual information, which impacts the level of risk posed by the processing it carries out, both for clients and third parties.

No mitigating circumstances are found.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 6.1 of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €10,000.00.

VII
Obligation not fulfilled. Information to be provided when the personal data have not been obtained from the data subject

As established in Article 14 of the GDPR:

"1. Where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information:

a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of his or her representative;
b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;
c) the purposes for which the personal data are processed, as well as the legal basis for the processing;
d) the categories of personal data concerned;

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, where applicable;
f) where applicable, the controller's intention to transfer personal data to a recipient in a third country or international organization and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or, in the case of transfers referred to in Articles 46 or 47 or Article 49, paragraph 1, second subparagraph,
reference to appropriate safeguards and the means of obtaining a copy of them or the place where they have been made available.

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing of data concerning the data subject:
a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or, where that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 23/34

b) where processing is based on Article 6, paragraph 1, point (f), the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party;
c) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the personal data relating to the data subject, rectification or erasure, or restriction of processing, and to object to processing, as well as the right to data portability;
d) where processing is based on Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;
e) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
f) the source of the personal data and, where applicable, whether they come from publicly available sources;
(g) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, as referred to in Article 22(1) and (4), and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.

3. The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2:

(a) within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data, and at the latest within one month, taking into account the specific circumstances of which the personal data are processed;
(b) if the personal data are to be used for communication with the data subject, at the latest at the time of the first communication to that data subject; or
(c) if the personal data are planned to be communicated to another recipient, at the latest at the time when the personal data are communicated for the first time.

4. Where the controller plans to further process personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were obtained, he or she shall, prior to such further processing, provide the data subject with information about that other purpose and any other relevant information referred to in paragraph 2.

5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply where and to the extent that:
a) the information is already available to the data subject;

b) communication of that information would be impossible or would entail a disproportionate effort, in particular for processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1), or to the extent that the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article would render impossible or seriously impede the achievement of the objectives of such processing. In such cases, the data controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests of the data subject, including making the information public; (c) the collection or communication is expressly established by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which provides for appropriate measures to safeguard the data subject's legitimate interests, or

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 24/34

(d) when the personal data must remain confidential based on an obligation of professional secrecy governed by Union or Member State law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy.

Article 14 of the GDPR establishes the controller's obligation to

provide clear and accessible information to the data subject when the personal data have not been obtained directly from them. This obligation aims to
ensure transparency in data processing, allowing data subjects to know the origin of their data, the purpose of the processing, the legal basis that supports it, the recipients of the information, the retention periods, and the rights they have, especially when the data has not been obtained directly

from the data subjects, since the risk of losing control and disposition of the data subject
regarding the personal data concerning them is greater.

In the present case, the claimant states that, on April 25, 2023,
his superiors gathered ESTUDIO ALCAZAR employees, urging them to

take photos and videos of the mailboxes of the Homeowners' Associations of the properties they visited to compile a database. Furthermore, he points out that the data subjects were not provided with any information regarding the processing of the data collected.

Among the documentation provided by the complainant are three photographs of

various mailboxes that he states have been uploaded to the database of
\*\*\*COMPANY.5, showing the following name, surname, and door number: H.H.H.

During the investigation activities carried out by this Agency at the headquarters of
\*\*\*COMPANY.5, recorded in the Inspection Report of November 20, 2024,
a record was found corresponding to "H.H.H." of the street "\*\*\*ADDRESS.4" as a

client of "\*\*\*COMPANY.9" in the Real Estate CRM (Customer Management Program)
"\*\*\*COMPANY.3", which only includes the client's name, surname, address, and date of last contact: "07/30/2024." The "Source" field shows: "Source Type: Internal Collaborator, Source Detail: B.B.B., Source Category: Direct Management
\[…\] System Data (…) by B.B.B. 4/25/2023. 4:42 PM. Last modified by J.J.J.
7/30/2024. 12:06 PM."

In its letter of December 9, 2024, in response to this Agency's request, ESTUDIO ALCAZAR, regarding the information it has on H.H.H., it states the following:

"H.H.H. is not a client of the company. However, in order to be diligent with this administration and to make available to you all information that may be relevant to the investigation, we inform you that the only information the company has on this gentleman is his first and last name, and his postal address, which are entered in the database (\*\*\*PLATAFORMA.1) as a potential client, more

specifically as a prospect, since the agent of \*\*\*EMPRESA.5, when registering his data, considered that he was a person who would be
potentially interested in our services, but that as of the date of writing this letter, he has not yet been contacted."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 25/34

Therefore, based on the evidence currently available regarding the initiation of sanctioning proceedings, it is considered that the known facts could constitute a procedural violation due to failure to inform the data subjects, in accordance with Article 14 of the GDPR, that the personal data concerning them was being processed by the respondent, and that this was attributable to
ESTUDIO ALCAZAR, for violation of the aforementioned article.

VIII

Classification of the violation of Article 14 of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of limitation

"b) the rights of data subjects pursuant to Articles 12 to 22;"

For its part, the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data) in its Article 71, Infractions, states that:

“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements.”

For the sole purpose of the statute of limitations, Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD establishes the following:

IX
Proposed sanction for violation of Article 14 of the GDPR

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for violations of this Regulation indicated in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

"1. The sanctions provided for in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in paragraph 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:
a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

h) The voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential violation, paying special attention to the consequences its commission has on those affected, a fine should be imposed, in addition to the adoption of measures, if appropriate.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR.

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available, the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to any resulting The investigation considers it appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions.

First, it is deemed that the following circumstances apply:

- The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered (Article 83.2, letter a) of the GDPR): the employees of ESTUDIO ALCAZAR. The severity of the violation in this case is evident in the fact that such behavior is not an isolated case, but rather, from the conversation provided by the complainant, it is evident that this is a common practice carried out by the respondent to collect personal data.

- Intentionality/Negligence in the infringement (Article 83.2, letter b) of the GDPR): The existence of gross negligence can be determined from the conversation between the complainant and his supervisor at ESTUDIO ALCAZAR. The latter expressly acknowledged that this practice was part of the methodology implemented for zone management. In response to the complainant's objection to the legality of the practice, the supervisor did not deny its existence, but simply referred any questions regarding its validity to the "legal sector."

Furthermore, the following grading factors are considered aggravating factors:

- The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (Article 76.2, letter b) of the LOPDGDD): The evident connection between ESTUDIO ALCAZAR's business activity and the processing of personal data. ESTUDIO ALCAZAR's real estate activity involves the processing of personal data of clients, owners, and tenants, including identification, financial, and contractual information, which impacts the level of risk involved in the processing it carries out, both for clients and third parties.

No mitigating circumstances are observed.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 14 of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of

€10,000.00.

Corrective Measures

If the violation is confirmed, the resolution issued may establish the corrective measures that the offending entity must adopt to end the non-compliance with personal data protection legislation, in this case Article 6.1 of the GDPR and Article 14 of the GDPR, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2.d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period..."

Thus, the responsible entity may be required to bring its actions into compliance with personal data protection regulations, within the scope expressed in the previous Legal Basis.

This document establishes the alleged violation committed and the facts that could lead to this potential breach of data protection regulations. From this, it is clear what measures to be adopted, without prejudice to the sanctioned party's responsibility to implement the specific procedures, mechanisms, or instruments. The data controller is fully familiar with their organization and must decide, based on proactive responsibility and a risk-based approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the LOPDGDD. However, in this case, regardless of the foregoing, in accordance with the evidence currently available regarding the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, the resolution adopted may require ESTUDIO ALCAZAR to adopt the following measures within two months from the date of the executive date of the resolution finalizing this procedure:

- Prove the deletion of the personal data collected from the mailboxes of the Homeowners' Associations.
- Prove the communication to the data subject(s) of the information required by Article 14 of the GDPR regarding the processing of personal data.
- Cease the processing of personal data collected from the mailboxes of the Homeowners' Associations.

The imposition of these measures is compatible with the sanction of an administrative fine, as provided in Article 83.2 of the GDPR.

Please be advised that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by this body in the resolution of this sanctioning procedure may be

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 29/34

considered an administrative violation under the provisions of the GDPR, classified as an infraction in Articles 83.5 and 83.6, and such conduct may lead to the opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

Please also remember that neither the recognition of the violation committed nor, where applicable, the voluntary payment of the proposed amounts exempts you from the obligation to adopt the relevant measures to cease the conduct or correct the effects of the violation committed, nor from the obligation to prove compliance with this obligation to this AEPD.

Therefore, in light of the above, the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
HAS RESOLVED:

FIRST: TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEEDINGS against ESTUDIO ALCAZAR DEL GENIL 2022, S.L., with NIF B09971029, for the alleged violation of Article 6.1 of the GDPR and Article 14 of the GDPR, as defined in Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

LEGAL BASIS

I
Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Termination of the Procedure

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 32/34

Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), under the heading "Termination of Sanctioning Procedures," provides the following:

"1. Once a sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender acknowledges responsibility, the procedure may be terminated with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.

2. When the sanction is solely pecuniary in nature, or when a pecuniary sanction and a non-pecuniary sanction may be imposed, but the inadmissibility of the second sanction has been justified, voluntary payment by the alleged responsible party, at any time prior to the resolution, will entail the termination of the procedure, except as provided in the relating to the restoration of the altered situation or the determination of compensation for damages caused by the commission of the violation.

3. In both cases, when the sanction is solely monetary, the competent body to resolve the procedure shall apply reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the proposed sanction, which may be combined.
These reductions must be specified in the notification of initiation of the procedure, and their effectiveness shall be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

The percentage reduction provided for in this section may be increased by regulation.

III

Voluntary Payment and Acknowledgment of Liability

In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 85 of the LPACAP, the notified initiation agreement provided information on the possibility of acknowledging liability and voluntarily paying the proposed penalty, which would entail two cumulative reductions of 20% each. With the application of these two reductions, the penalty would be set at €12,000.00, and its payment would imply the termination of the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

Following notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement, ESTUDIO ALCAZAR has proceeded to acknowledge liability and voluntarily pay the penalty, availing itself of the two proposed reductions. In accordance with section 3 of Article 85 of the LPACAP, the effectiveness of the aforementioned reductions will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the penalty.

It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of the LPACAP, as well as the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this matter, the exercise of voluntary payment by the alleged liable party does not exempt the administration from the obligation to resolve and notify all proceedings, regardless of their initiation. Similarly, Article 88 of the aforementioned law establishes that the resolution that concludes the proceedings will decide all issues raised by the interested parties and any other issues arising from them. C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

FOURTH: NOTIFY this resolution to ESTUDIO ALCAZAR DEL GENIL 2022, S.L.

FIFTH: In accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code), which conditions the reduction for voluntary payment and acknowledgment of liability on the withdrawal or waiver of any action or appeal in administrative proceedings, this resolution will become final in administrative proceedings and fully enforceable upon notification.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 50 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Civil Code), this resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.

Any appeal against this resolution, which terminates the administrative proceedings as provided for in
Art. 114.1.c) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations, interested parties may file an administrative appeal before the Administrative Litigation Division of the National Court, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25 and section 5 of the fourth additional provision of Law 29/1998, of July 13, regulating the Administrative Litigation Jurisdiction, within two months from the day following notification of this act, as provided for in Article 46.1 of the aforementioned Law.

However, in accordance with the provisions of Article 90.3.a) of the LPACAP, the final administrative decision may be provisionally suspended if the interested party expresses their intention to file an administrative appeal.
