## English Summary

### Facts

An employee signed an employment contract with the company Cyngasa, S.L. Some time later, the employee asked the Spanish Social Security for a employment history report. In this report, the employee found that, although he had signed the employment contract with Cyngasa, another company had registered him with the Social Security. That company was Calderería y soldadura de Estructuras Metálicas, S.L. Consequently, Cyngasa had transferred the employee's data to Calderería y soldadura de Estructuras Metálicas without justification and without the employee's consent.

Neither of the two companies involved responded to the requests of the AEPD.

### Holding

The AEPD does not detail the reasons for the breach and simply points out that the transfer of an employee data to a third party company without consent is a breach of [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

## Comment

_This particular decision (PS/00244/2021) sanctions the company that transferred the data, but there is another decision of the AEPD in which it also sanctions the transferring company (PS/00245/2021)._
