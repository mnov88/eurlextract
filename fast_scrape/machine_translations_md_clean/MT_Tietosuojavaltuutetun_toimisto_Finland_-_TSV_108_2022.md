## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is Yliopiston Apteekki (University Pharmacy), the largest pharmacy operator in Finland. The controller operates the largest online pharmacy in the county, from where individuals can order prescription and over-the-counter medicines. The controller uses third-party tracking services on its website.

A whistleblower notified the DPA that the controller transmits pharmaceutical data from its online pharmacy, such as browsing data or data indicating the intention to purchase a particular medicine, to Meta, Google and New Relic (a performance monitoring service). These companies received precise information about medicine purchases, data that could be linked to an individual customer.

In June 2022 the DPA initiated investigation on the matter.

  
The controller claimed that no information about the medicines purchased by the customers or the names of the medicines have been transmitted to Meta, Google or New Relic and that is not possible to draw any conclusions from the pages viewed as to what products the customer has purchased, let alone any further conclusions about the health or medical condition of the person. The controller has further argued that any data transmitted have been limited and masked and in any case browsing data are not personal data under the GDPR.

### Holding

First, the DPA held that the controller failed to ensure that external tracking service providers (Google, Meta) did not have access to personal data relating to online pharmacy transactions in a way that was contrary to the requirements of integrity, confidentiality and security of processing therefore violating Article 5(1)(f), Article 32(1) and [Article 32(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#2 "Article 32 GDPR").

The DPA found that the website’s service providers received information about website visitors, such as IP addresses and other data that can be used to identify the data subject. The combination of these data with data across different website visits can allow for large- scale, automated identification and profiling of the data subjects. As a result, the DPA held that the data on browsing, purchase intention and purchase of medicines transmitted by the controller to the monitoring service provider are therefore, in relation to the service provider, personal data of an identifiable person within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the GDPR.

Second, the DPA found that the controller violated the principle of data minimisation by transmitting, to New Relic, data which were not necessary for the purpose of monitoring the performance of the website according to Article 5(1)(c) and Article 25(2) GDPR.

Lastly, the Sanctions Board order the controller to pay an administrative fine of €1,100,000, pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83 GDPR.

The decision below is a machine translation of the Finnish original. Please refer to the Finnish original for more details.

```
Explanation received from the controllerRequest for clarification 22.6.202210. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has requested an explanation from the controller by a request for clarification dated 22.6.2022. The controller has submitted a written explanation on the matter on 12.9.2022.11. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has submitted to the controller a document prepared by the university research team as an attachment to its request for clarification, which shows, for example, the method of testing carried out by the research team and the information transmitted to the designated monitoring service providers, including information about medicines.
The controller states in its explanation that some of the observations listed in the document received from the notifier have previously taken place, but the controller has since changed its methods of operation.
12. According to the controller, it has been using the Facebook marketing service (Meta for Business) on its website. The controller states that the service was not intended to be used on prescription medicine websites, but this has happened due to human error. The controller states that it has taken the service out of use for prescription medicines. The controller states in its report that it has collected information on purchases made via Facebook and has optimised and targeted advertising based on this information.\[5\]
13. According to the controller, it has acted as a joint controller with Facebook in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation for marketing services provided by Facebook. The controller states that it has taken the service out of use, stopped the related data processing and asked Facebook's parent company Meta to delete all data obtained in connection with this processing. The controller states that it cannot influence the processing that Facebook independently continues or that goes beyond the purposes defined for the processing that are related to the controller's marketing purposes.14. The controller states that it has used the Google Fonts service provided by Google in the styles of the websites. According to the report, the service has been moved to a locally hosted version that does not transfer personal data to Google. Google's Fonts service has also been removed from the Consent Security Policy (CSP) regulation.15. According to the controller, in the data processing agreement with Google, the use of data for a purpose other than the implementation of the processing activities described by the controller is directly prohibited under the General Data Protection Regulation when the service provider acts as a processor. The controller also states that it has asked Google to delete the data that Google, as a processor, has processed on behalf of the controller.16. In addition, the controller states that it has used the service provided by the Finnish company Videoly Oy to attach media and YouTube videos to product pages. The controller states that it has decided to deactivate the service. The controller states that it has asked Google to delete the data that Google has processed on behalf of the controller.17. According to the controller, New Relic is a website performance monitoring service used by the controller to monitor the performance of the website and its services in order to improve the customer experience. According to the controller, IP address data has been collected, among other things, for information security reasons to identify the country from which the web traffic has come to the controller's website.
The controller states that it has reassessed the use of the Browser Agent module of the New Relic service that transmits IP address information and has decided to remove the New Relic software module from its use.18. In connection with its investigation, the controller has submitted to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman documents relating to the impact assessment, a data protection statement, and a copy of Regulation 2/2011 of the Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea on 10 May 2021 on pharmacy online services. Request for hearing 1 July 202419. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has sent the controller a request for hearing and further clarification on 1 July 2024. The request for hearing will be sent to the controller in a situation where it is considered that the sanctioning body referred to in section 24 of the Data Protection Act (1050/2018) should handle the matter. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has reserved an opportunity for the controller to be heard on the facts presented in the case and the preliminary assessment of the matter. In addition, the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has reserved an opportunity for the controller to be heard on the possible penalty to be imposed in the case and the opportunity to submit other possible documentation that, in its opinion, is of significance in the resolution of the case. On 2 July 2024, the controller submitted its annual report for 2023 to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman, and on 20 September 2024, the controller submitted its response to the request for a hearing to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman. 20. In its response to the hearing, the controller states that no information has been transmitted to Metal\[6\], Google or New Relic about the medicines purchased by the customer or the name of the medicine. According to the controller, when a visitor visits the product pages of the controller's online pharmacy's medicines, the information transmitted to these service providers is mainly limited to the fact that the person has visited certain product pages of the University Pharmacy. According to the controller, users of the websites can browse products and add them to their shopping cart without any real intention to purchase the product or even by accident. According to the controller's investigation, calls containing the following information have been transmitted to Google regarding the purchase of a medicine: Purchase, PRESCRIPTION DRUG, price 3.95\[7\], 99999, where the name of the medicine has been replaced by the word PRESCRIPTION DRUG or SELF-HEALTH DRUG, and the product number has been replaced by a series of numbers. In addition, the order number and information on how many products the order contains have been transmitted to Google. Information about the purchase has also been transmitted to Metal (Purchase, ecommerce.purchase) and the product number masked in the manner described above. Information about the total amount of the shopping cart and the currency used has also been transmitted to Metal. According to the controller, no information about PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE or OVER-THE-COUNTRY MEDICINE has been transmitted to Metal. 21. According to the controller, all purchase information regarding medicines (including, for example, the names and quantities of products purchased) has been masked, i.e. made completely unrecognizable before the information is transmitted to an external service provider (Google, Meta), and the information transmitted cannot be used to determine the purchases made by the customer. According to the controller, it has not been necessary to mask the information transmitted to New Relic, because only information about the URL address the user has visited has been transmitted to New Relic. The controller states in its statement that no service provider has received information about the medicine ordered by the customer, such as the name of the medicine or the number of tablets.22. The controller states that in the masking, for example, the name of the medicine, insofar as it has been transmitted to the service provider, has been replaced with the generic term PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE or OVER-THE-COUNTRY MEDICINE, and the product number has been replaced with the generic number series 99999 or 88888. According to the controller, the medicine information has been masked since 2015.23. The controller states that, according to the generally accepted understanding in the online shopping industry, only approximately 2–3% of online shop visitors make a purchase from the online shop. The controller states that no conclusions can be drawn from the pages viewed about which products the customer has purchased, let alone any conclusions that go beyond this regarding the person's health or illnesses. According to the controller, browsing data is not, as such, data in accordance with Article 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation. The controller also states that over-the-counter medicines have numerous different uses, and these products are typically purchased even in situations where there is no reason for the purchase related to the current state of health.24. According to the controller, website visit data has only been sent to Google Analytics and Metal when the user has accepted the cookie for the tracking technology in question. According to the controller, it should also be noted that, according to its measurement, approximately 20–30% of visitors to the University Pharmacy website completely prohibit the use of cookies.25. The controller states that New Relic has only been informed of the URL address of the page visited, and no more detailed information about the content of the page.
In addition, according to the controller, New Relic has obtained the user's IP address and device information when the Browser Agent software module provided by New Relic has been in use (removed from use on 8 September 2022). 26. According to the controller, Meta only connects data to users who have registered for the services provided by Meta. The information received by Meta, as described above (which does not include information about the purchased product or even its product category), has therefore only been able to be connected to users of the University Pharmacy website who have both accepted Meta's cookie and registered with Meta's Facebook service. 27. The controller states that it has removed Meta's tracking pixel (so-called Meta pixel) from its website on 8 September 2022. According to the controller, it still uses the Meta for Business advertising management system, which, according to the controller, does not track website visitors. According to the controller, Google Analytics was removed from the University Pharmacy website on 14 April 2022.28. According to the controller, on 16 September 2022, it asked Meta to delete all data obtained in connection with the processing. The controller says that it has also asked Google to delete the data that it has processed on behalf of the University Pharmacy.29. The controller states that the IP address is in practice the only information that allows an external service provider to identify and even identify an individual user with reasonable certainty. According to the controller, the service providers it uses (Google, Meta, New Relic) also do not have the possibility of obtaining information from the internet operator or authorities about who the user behind a certain IP address is. The controller states that in practice, with regard to Google and Meta, it has not been possible for the said service providers to identify the user, except for users who have used the University Pharmacy website and have been logged in to the Google or Meta service at the same time. 30. The controller states that it is typical that the contractual terms and conditions relating to online monitoring are not negotiable. According to the controller, it has no indication that the personal data processors it uses (Google, Meta, New Relic) have not complied with the data processing agreements concluded with them.
31. According to the controller, the services of Google, Meta and New Relic have been used as follows:

Google Analytics
from 5.5.2015 to 14.4.2022;

Google Tag Manager
from 5.5.2015 to 8.9.2022;

Google Fonts
from 21.3.2021 to 8.9.2022 (after which the controller has switched to a locally maintained version);

the Google Maps
service in the Contact section of the website (www.yliopistonapteekki.fi/yhteystiedot) since 21.3.2021, and the service is still in use;

YouTube
has been used as a service provided by the Finnish company Videoly Oy from 1.12.2017 to 8.9.2022. After this, embedded videos have been imported from YouTube only to the "About us" website (), and this method of operation is still in use; The Meta pixel (formerly the Facebook pixel) has been disabled from the entire website on September 8, 2022. The controller does not have precise information about when the Meta pixel was inadvertently activated on the medicine pages, as the controller has requested Meta to delete all information regarding this processing. According to the controller's assessment, this activation occurred either on October 1, 2020, when Meta provided an updated version of its pixel, or on March 21, 2021, when the University Pharmacy moved to a new website platform; New Relic's Browser Agent software module has been in use between June 1, 2019 and September 8, 2022. 32. The controller states that according to internal reports available to it, in 2021, the controller's website was visited by an estimated
\[number deleted\] visitors, i.e. devices, per week.
According to the controller, this number for 2021 is an average
estimate and a single sample, which can vary greatly between different years and
months, and does not indicate the actual
number of individual visitors. The controller estimates that the number of devices is likely to be
significantly higher than the number of individual data subjects.
The controller's report shows that the number of customers who have made pharmaceutical purchases has been \[number deleted\] in 2018, \[number deleted\] in 2019, \[number deleted\] in 2020, \[number deleted\] in 2021 and \[number deleted\] in 2022. According to the controller's assessment, \[number deleted\] customers are repeat customers who return to make purchases in several different years. In 2018–2022, a total of \[number deleted\] orders have been made.33 The controller states that it is not able to state with reasonable certainty how many data subjects' data have been processed in the Google, Meta and New Relic services, as would be required for its legal protection in administrative decision-making. The controller submits that, as a result, the only reasonably verifiable information should be taken into account in this matter, namely the number of data subjects who have placed orders for medicines from the University Pharmacy's online pharmacy. According to the controller, the monthly average of medicine orders in the period 2018–2024 has been approximately \[number of orders deleted\] orders per month. The controller has also submitted to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman a table describing the order volumes on an annual basis and the average monthly order volumes in the years 2018–2024. The controller has also submitted to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman a table describing the controller's estimate of the number of customers who have made medicine purchases in the years 2018–2024. 34. The controller submits that the sanctions to be considered should take into account the previous decisions of the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman, such as the decisions in cases 4672/161/22 (Helmet libraries) and 7684/171/22 (Finnish Meteorological Institute). According to the controller, it appears that the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has, in its previous decision practice, considered the removal of analytics and a request to the controller's service provider to remove all data from their services as sufficient remedial measures. In its explanations, the controller also raises
decisions 3831/161/21 (Kesko) and 1509/452/18 (City of Espoo) and
considers that it is not appropriate to impose an administrative penalty fee, taking these decisions into account either. Supplementary hearing request on 6 November 202435. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has sent the controller
a supplementary hearing request on 6 November 2024. The controller has submitted its response to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman on 4 December 2024.36. In its hearing response to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman on 20 September 2024, the controller has stated that it has not forwarded to the monitoring service providers the information presented in the hearing request describing the browsing of medicines or the intention to purchase. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman
has provided the controller with the HAR file received from the notifier
as is and has asked the controller to comment on its content.
The HAR file contains calls made by the www browser, with which
the website visitor's www browser has called up the web pages on the www server of the controller's
online pharmacy.37. In connection with the supplementary hearing request
the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has also provided the controller with screenshots saved on 26.9.2024
of the controller's online pharmacy website
(www.yliopistonapteekki.fi). The screenshots show that the customer
can press the "order prescription medicine"
button for a certain prescription medicine before he/she proceeds to identify himself/herself for the pharmacist's
chat service. 38. The controller has further stated in its response to the hearing that the information transmitted to Google and Meta has been limited and masked (covered). In its response, the controller has also provided a detailed explanation of the product purchase path in the online pharmacy. 39. As regards Meta, the controller specifies that information about the URL address of the page, the total amount of the shopping cart (after any Kela compensation) and the usual information about the user's browser have been transmitted to Meta in connection with the page load, as part of normal network traffic. If the user had not accepted cookies, according to the controller, even the information described above was not transmitted to Meta. 40. According to the controller, New Relic has not actually had any other information available to it in addition to the user's dynamic IP address, on the basis of which it would be possible to connect to an individual user. 41. According to the controller, the HAR file submitted to it along with the request for a hearing,
and saved by the university research group, is
incomplete in many respects. The controller submits, among other things, that
the information displayed in the HAR file and in the Developer Tool
is not the same for everyone using the same website, but only relates to the user in question and the browsing session in question, and
the information changes based on the choices made by the user himself.
According to the controller, the HAR file only describes a fraction of the
functions that it is intended to prove in this case, and
based on the HAR file, the controller believes, for example,
that the person who created it never orders medicines,
and the HAR file therefore does not support claims that information containing purchase information
is being forwarded.42. Regarding the number of registered users, the controller submits that the controller's online pharmacy prescription\[8\] should be primarily taken into account in the case, rather than the total website visitor volume. The University Pharmacy's prescriptions in the period 08/2020–08/2022 have been \[number deleted\] and the number of individual buyers in the same period of review has been \[number deleted\]. 43. The controller also emphasizes in its response that the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in case C-21/23 specifically concerns the purchase of a medicinal product, whereby the purchase of the product has been attributable to the subscriber as an individual. The controller considers that the circumstances differ from the present case, and the level of probability required in the judgment between the subscriber and the user of the medicinal product is not met in the case of the controller. 44. According to the controller, it has not intended to collect data from users belonging to special categories of personal data based on their web browsing, nor has it been intended that service providers acting on its behalf would collect such data from users. The controller adds that in its view, the legal situation regarding the interpretation of cookies and IP addresses as personal data and the status of ordered medicines as health data within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation has long been unclear, so that the Court of Justice of the European Union has only issued clarifying interpretation guidelines in recent years.45 According to the controller, it is part of the University of Helsinki Group.
The controller states that according to the Group Guidelines of the University of Helsinki, the group refers to the University of Helsinki as the parent entity and its subsidiaries in which the University of Helsinki, alone or together with other entities belonging to the group, has control as referred to in the Accounting Act, and that the University Pharmacy, the University of Helsinki Funds and foundations under the control of the University of Helsinki are also considered subsidiaries. The controller further submits that, on the basis of the University Pharmacy's regulations (dated 11 December 2019), the University Pharmacy operates in the manner specified by the Board of the University of Helsinki.46. The controller submits that it is an independent legal entity under public law, which cannot be subject to an administrative penalty payment under the Data Protection Act. Supplementary hearing request 12 December 202447. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has sent the controller a supplementary request for a hearing on 12 December 2024. The controller has submitted its response to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman on 23 January 2025. 
48. At this stage, the controller has been heard, among other things, on the fact that, based on the investigation, it is further transmitting information on medicines on its pharmacy website to various monitoring service providers.
For example, information is provided to the Giosg and Videobot services about which
medicines a website visitor is browsing in an online pharmacy. Information about which
medicine a website visitor has added to the shopping cart is provided to
Klarna and Frosmo. The controller has also been consulted about whether
for example, in the following call forwarded to Google, in the items
99999
and
PRECISION DRUG
(marked in bold in the call)
the controller's masking measures are involved. The data controller's attention
has been drawn to the fact that in this case too, the invitation includes
information about the medicine (marked in bold on the invitation): GET

49. The controller states in its response to the hearing that
the GET call presented in the hearing request, originating from the HAR file, and
the painted section of the URL address visible therein are not its way of masking
(hiding) data. According to the controller, the primary purpose of masking is specifically to mask information about the purchase transaction, and the HAR file provided by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner does not contain any URL addresses for purchase transactions. According to the controller, all product information regarding the purchase transaction has been masked, and information about browsing the product itself can in no way be considered as information belonging to special categories of personal data.50. With regard to Referer information, the controller states that information about the page from which the user has moved to the page in question (Referer information) is an important part of web analytics. It helps the website operator to better understand how visitors generally navigate the site. The purpose of analytics is not to monitor the activities of a specific user, let alone identify the user in question, and according to the controller, this is not even possible. The controller states that the Referer variable is important for the smooth operation of the Internet and for information security. 51. With regard to the URL, the controller states that the majority of internet users use strings of letters in the URL field rather than numbers because a name logically related to the website being searched for is easier to remember than numbers. In the context of browsing data, i.e. when a visitor to the site views product-specific pages, the URL refers to the product in question. However, the URL changes based on the stage of the purchase path. The controller also emphasizes that the URL does not reveal the name of the medicine purchased. According to the controller, the use of plain language URLs is one way to ensure that, for example, visually impaired people can use the controller's online services without hindrance and that, for example, a speech synthesizer can translate text. 52. Regarding the transmission of information about medicines added to the shopping cart, the controller states that even if the user specifically wants to buy Risperdal 1 mg, the user's shopping cart is completely empty of prescription medicines after logging in to the pharmacist's chat service. After logging in, the user must start pre-selecting the product again. It is also possible to access the prescription transaction home page in several different ways, without going through the product page at all. The controller states that the tracking services do not see whether the user has purchased one or more specific over-the-counter medicines or removed products from their shopping cart.53. The controller states that if the browsing data itself were to be classified as special categories of personal data, it would mean, among other things, that all social and healthcare websites would be in breach of the General Data Protection Regulation or that it would make using the internet very difficult, as every website would have to request explicit consent to the processing of special categories of personal data when using external components. The controller states that this involved the processing of personal data by third-party monitoring service providers who are bound by data processing agreements on behalf of the University Pharmacy.54. According to the controller, no information is provided to Klarna about which prescription medicine the customer has purchased. The data controller has terminated its agreement with Klarna on 3 September 2024, and the use of the service in the University Pharmacy's online pharmacy will end in February 2025. Test order by the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman on 19 December 202455. On 19 December 2024, the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman placed a test order from the data controller's online pharmacy (www.yliopistonapteekki.fi). The order included two over-the-counter medicines (Nasolin nasal spray, Burana capsules). In this connection, the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has stored calls from the data controller's online pharmacy website to tracking service providers (such as Giosg, Piwik PRO), which have included, for example, information about the completion of the online pharmacy order and what medicines the order has contained. The said calls can be found in the appendix to this decision. The controller has been consulted on this report by a request for a hearing dated 7 January 2025. Supplementary request for a hearing on 7 January 202556. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman has sent the controller a supplementary request for a hearing on 7 January 2025. The controller has been consulted on the test purchase made by the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman on 19 December 2024.
The controller has submitted its response to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman on 23 January 2025.57. In its response, the controller states that information on which over-the-counter medicines have been purchased is not transferred to monitoring service providers.
According to the controller, for example, the invitation regarding the "thank you for your order" stage does not contain a reference to the content of the purchase transaction itself or which over-the-counter medicine the customer has purchased.
Applicable legislation60. The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (GDPR) and the national data protection act (1050/2018) specifying and supplementing it apply in this case.61. Article 4(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation provides for the definition of personal data as follows: ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, hereinafter referred to as ‘data subject’; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to identifiers such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifiers or to one or more factors specific to that natural person’,62. Article 4(15) of the GDPR defines data on health as follows: ‘data on health’ means personal data relating to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including data relating to the provision of health services which indicate his or her state of health.63. Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR lays down the principles of fairness and transparency. According to this Article, personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner with regard to the data subject.64. Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR lays down the principle of data minimisation. According to this Article, personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.65. Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR lays down the principles of integrity and confidentiality. According to the Article, personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.66. Article 9 of the GDPR provides for the processing of special categories of personal data. According to Article 1, the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, as well as the processing of genetic or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, or data concerning health, or data concerning a natural person's sexual behaviour or orientation, is prohibited. Article 2 provides for exceptions to the prohibition in Article 1.67. Article 25 of the GDPR provides for data protection by design and by default. Paragraph 1 of the Article states that, taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, and the risks of varying likelihood and severity to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, when determining the means of processing and when carrying out the processing, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to effectively implement data protection principles such as data minimisation, such as pseudonymisation and appropriate safeguards, in order to ensure that the processing complies with the requirements of this Regulation and protects the rights of data subjects. Paragraph 2 of the Article states that the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data that are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed.This obligation concerns the amount of personal data collected, the scope of the processing, the retention period and the availability. These measures shall ensure, in particular, that personal data are not made available to an unlimited number of persons by default without the consent of the natural person.68. Article 32 of the GDPR provides for the security of processing. According to Article 32(1), taking into account the state of the art and the cost of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as encryption of personal data, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. According to Article 2, the assessment of the appropriate level of security shall take into account the risks presented by the processing, in particular the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.69. Article 58(2) of the GDPR provides for the remedial powers of the supervisory authority. Under Article 58(2) of the GDPR, the supervisory authority may issue a warning to the controller or processor where the processing operations have infringed the provisions of the GDPR. Under Article 58(i), the supervisory authority may impose an administrative fine in accordance with Article 83 in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each individual case. Recitals of the GDPR70. Recital 30 of the GDPR states the following regarding the identification of natural persons: Natural persons may be linked to online identifiers of the devices, applications, tools and protocols they use, such as IP addresses, cookies or other identifiers, such as radio frequency identifiers. This may leave traces of the user which can be used to profile and identify natural persons, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information transmitted to servers.71 Recital 35 of the GDPR states the following regarding data concerning health: Personal data concerning health means any information relating to the health of a data subject and revealing information about the past, present or future physical or mental health of the data subject. This includes data relating to a natural person collected in the context of his or her registration for or provision of health services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (9); a number, symbol or unique identifier assigned to a natural person which allows him or her to be uniquely identified in the context of health care; data obtained from the testing or examination of a part of the body or a substance derived from the body, such as genetic data and biological samples, and any information relating to, for example, illnesses, injuries, risk of illness, previous information or treatments received, and information relating to the physical or medical situation of the data subject, regardless of the source from which the data were obtained, such as a doctor or other healthcare professional, a hospital, a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic test.72. Recital 51 of the General Data Protection Regulation states that personal data which are particularly sensitive in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms shall be protected in a particularly strict manner, since the context in which they are processed could result in significant risks to fundamental rights and freedoms. Decision of the Penalty Board on the imposition of an administrative penalty fee Controller University Pharmacy (Business ID 0202635-1) According to Section 24 of the Data Protection Act, an administrative penalty fee shall be imposed by a Penalty Board consisting of the Data Protection Commissioner and the Deputy Data Protection Commissioners, which has issued the following decision on the imposition of an administrative penalty fee. 1. As is apparent from the decision of the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, the controller has not complied with Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation. In his decision, the Assistant Data Protection Supervisor has issued a warning to the controller in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the infringement of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the GDPR. 2. Given the seriousness of the infringement, the case does not constitute a minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 of the GDPR. In terms of effectiveness and proportionality, it must be stated that in the present case, the warning issued by the Assistant Data Protection Supervisor pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR is not a sufficient sanction in the case, taking into account the provisions of Article 83(2) of the GDPR. 3. An administrative penalty payment must be imposed in the case for the failure to comply with the obligations relating to the security of processing established in paragraph 77 of the Assistant Data Protection Supervisor's decision. The imposition of a penalty payment is supported in particular by the fact that the controller's practice, which has lasted for several years and concerns a large number of data subjects, in which it has transmitted data relating to medicines that can be linked to natural persons to Google and Metal, has constituted a significant risk to the exercise of the right to the protection of personal data of numerous data subjects. The processing of medicinal data is part of the controller's core business, which in turn underlines the fact that the controller should have paid particular attention to the security of the processing. It should be noted that the procedure assessed exclusively in the case with regard to prescription medicines has already been sufficient to impose a penalty payment. 4. The case at hand falls within the higher penalty payment category pursuant to Article 83(5)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation. The fine imposed for the infringement may not exceed either EUR 20,000,000 or four percent of the annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is the greater. 5. On 21 May 2025, the controller notified the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman that the turnover of the University Pharmacy Group for 2024 was EUR 338,992,444.95.\[62\] The controller is the largest pharmacy operator in Finland\[63\] and its online pharmacy is also the largest in Finland.\[64\]
In addition to the above-mentioned remark by the Deputy Data Protection Supervisor, the Penalty Board (hereinafter: “Penalty Board”), in accordance with Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83 of the GDPR, imposes on the controller an administrative penalty of EUR 1,100,000 (one million one hundred thousand) to be paid to the State. Taking into account the seriousness of the infringement and the other circumstances of the case, as further explained in the reasoning of the Penalty Board below, the Penalty Board considers the administrative penalty of EUR 1,100,000 to be effective and proportionate. In the amount of the penalty payment, special attention has been paid to the fact that, according to the report received, the controller's income is used for education and research. On the possibility of imposing an administrative penalty payment on the University Pharmacy6. In its hearing response to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman on 20 September 2024, the controller has stated that it is another public law institution owned by the University of Helsinki. In its supplementary hearing response to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman on 4 December 2024, the controller has also stated that it is an independent legal entity under public law, which cannot be subject to an administrative penalty payment referred to in Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation.7. In its hearing response dated 4 December 2024, the controller has also stated that it is part of the University of Helsinki Group. The Registrar states that according to the University of Helsinki's Group Guidelines, the Group refers to the University of Helsinki as the parent entity and its subsidiaries in which the University of Helsinki, either alone or together with other entities belonging to the Group, has control as referred to in the Accounting Act, and that the University Pharmacy, the University of Helsinki Funds and foundations under the control of the University of Helsinki are also equated with subsidiaries. The Registrar further submits that, based on the University Pharmacy's regulations (dated 11 December 2019), the University Pharmacy operates in the manner specified by the University of Helsinki's Board of Directors. 8. Section 24.4 of the Data Protection Act (1050/2018), which concerns operators excluded from the administrative penalty fee, does not state that a penalty fee cannot be imposed on an independent legal person governed by public law, as the controller has defined itself in its response to the hearing given to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman. The exception also does not include other public institutions, as the controller has also stated. Section 24.4 of the Data Protection Act, however, does include independent public institutions, which cannot be imposed on an administrative penalty fee. Regarding the definition of an independent public law institution and the possibility of imposing an administrative penalty on the University Pharmacy, the Penalty Board of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner states the following: 9. According to Section 24.4 of the Data Protection Act, a penalty cannot be imposed on state authorities, state-owned enterprises, municipal authorities, independent public law institutions, parliamentary agencies, the Office of the President of the Republic, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and the Finnish Orthodox Church, or their parishes, parish federations and other bodies.
The government's proposal for a data protection law specifies that
in this context, the concept of an independent public institution also covers
a university institution.\[65\]
10. The government proposal on the Data Protection Act also states regarding the limitation presented above that “
According to the proposed law, the limitation
would not apply to those private entities that perform public administrative tasks referred to in Section 124 of the Data Protection Act. Such operators cannot
be excluded from the application of the administrative penalty fee pursuant to Article 83(7) of the Data Protection Regulation,
according to which the margin of manoeuvre only applies to authorities. Such
a punitive administrative penalty against an authority would be a procedure that is foreign to the current legal order,
and would require a kind of system change that
would have had to be prepared in a short time.
\[…\]
It is not necessary at this
stage to extend the administrative penalty fee to the processing of personal data by authorities, as authorities are bound by the requirement of legality of administration
and authorities must also otherwise comply with general administrative laws.
The processing of personal data by authorities is subject to also
criminal official liability and liability for damages
. \[…\]
In addition, the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of Justice supervise
the legality of the actions of authorities and civil servants and
that authorities and civil servants fulfil
their obligations
”.\[66\]
11. It should be noted that the University Pharmacy is not an authority, and the procedure examined in this
case therefore does not concern the processing of personal data by an authority. The legislation on the University Pharmacy also does not indicate that the employees of the University Pharmacy are in an official relationship. Official liability, which has been considered as a basis for exempting the operator from administrative penalty payments, will therefore not be applicable to the University Pharmacy as intended in the Data Protection Act. 12. The concept of an independent public institution has been specified in
various national regulations. The list of independent public law institutions presented in the Government proposal on the Administrative Procedure Act (434/2003) does not include a mention of the University Pharmacy. The list of independent public law institutions presented in the Government proposal on the Publicity Act does not include a mention of the University Pharmacy. The preparatory works for the Archives Act (831/1994), the Bankruptcy Act (120/2004) or the Act on Electronic Services in Public Administration (13/2003) do not include a mention of the University Pharmacy either.
13. As is clear from the above, in some cases, such as in the present case, in particular when applying the Data Protection Act, a university institution is considered an independent public law institution.
The University Pharmacy is owned by the University of Helsinki.
The relationship between the University of Helsinki and the University Pharmacy has already been assessed in the Administrative Court.
In its decision no. 17/0582/3 (21.6.2017), the Helsinki Administrative Court has held that the University of Helsinki is not a party to the matter concerning the University Pharmacy's branch pharmacy permit: "The Administrative Court finds that the right of the University of Helsinki to maintain a pharmacy is based on special rights related to the university's status and that the Helsinki University Pharmacy is a pharmacy maintained and owned by the university. Considering that the University of Helsinki has, by its internal delegation decision and bylaws, transferred the operational activities of maintaining a pharmacy and the related administrative measures to the Helsinki University Pharmacy, the Administrative Court holds that neither the University of Helsinki nor the Helsinki University Funds should be considered parties to the matter concerning the branch pharmacy permit and that they have not been heard as parties before the matter was resolved." \[67\] The University Pharmacy has thus been considered in case law to be functionally separate from the University of Helsinki. from the university.

14. It can also be stated that the University Pharmacy operates in a competitive
market. For example, the Parliamentary Committee on Social Affairs and Health has, in its report on the government's proposal to amend the Medicines Act and the Act on Pharmacy Fees (StVM 42/1998 vp), taken this into account and stated in its position that the Helsinki University Pharmacy should not receive any special advantage from its position in connection with the university: “The Helsinki University Pharmacy is based on the privileges granted to the University of Helsinki in the form of a government. The pharmacy is justified for the proper management of pharmacy teaching and research, but university pharmacies should not have such a position that they receive any special advantage from their position in connection with the university. Therefore, strict care should be taken to ensure that the fees and other charges imposed on university pharmacies correspond to the charges and charges imposed on private pharmacies, and on the other hand, that they do not use their special position in an inappropriate manner in the pricing and marketing of products.”\[68\]
15. University Pharmacy is not an independent public institution or other operator referred to in Article 24.4 of the Data Protection Act as set out above. The University Pharmacy shall therefore be regarded as an operator to whom an administrative penalty referred to in Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation may be imposed. Grounds for imposing an administrative penalty16. Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation lays down the general conditions for imposing an administrative penalty. First, the imposition of an administrative penalty must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case. Second, the administrative penalty shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the corrective powers provided for in Article 58, in accordance with the circumstances of each individual case. In the present case, the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner has issued a warning to the controller. The administrative fine is therefore imposed in addition to the notice pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR.17. When determining the imposition of an administrative fine and the amount of the administrative fine, the factors listed in Article 83(2) of the GDPR shall be taken into account in each individual case.18. As the Deputy Data Protection Supervisor has found in the decision, the controller has not complied with Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the GDPR.19. According to Article 83(3) of the GDPR, where the controller, in the same or related processing operations, intentionally or negligently infringes several provisions of the GDPR, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the fine imposed for the most serious infringement.20. The seriousness of the infringement shall be assessed on the basis of the elements listed in Article 83(2) of the GDPR. The assessment shall be made by selecting the act or omission which, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case under assessment, can be considered the most serious.21. The present case concerns the obligation to ensure the security of the processing of personal data, including the appropriate protection of data, laid down in Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 of the GDPR. As stated in paragraph 4 above, the case falls within the higher category of sanctions under Article 83(5)(a) of the GDPR.22. The assessment of the case has taken into account the guidelines on the imposition of administrative fines issued by the European Union Working Party and the European Data Protection Board\[69\]. 23. In paragraph 34 of the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner's decision, the controller has stated that the sanctions to be considered should take into account the previous decisions of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, such as the decisions in cases 4672/161/22 (Helmet libraries) and 7684/171/22 (Finnish Meteorological Institute). The Penalty Board notes for clarity that the aforementioned decisions concern international data transfers in accordance with Chapter V of the General Data Protection Regulation, i.e. they have assessed a different procedure than in the controller's case. In the case concerning the Helmet libraries, it has also been assessed whether the controllers have complied with Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation. However, the data controllers are four cities in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, which cannot be subject to an administrative penalty fee as provided for in Section 24.4 of the Data Protection Act, and therefore the imposition of a penalty fee could not be assessed in the said case. In its explanations, the data controller has also referred to decisions 3831/161/21 (Kesko Corporation) and 1509/452/18 (City of Espoo) and submitted that it is not appropriate to impose an administrative penalty fee. It should be noted that decision 1509/452/18 concerns a city for which an administrative penalty fee cannot be imposed as provided for in Section 24.4 of the Data Protection Act. The said decision and decision 3831/161/21 concerning Kesko Corporation also concern a different procedure than the case of the data controller. In the decision
1509/452/18 concerning the City of Espoo, the basis for processing personal data has been assessed. In the decision
3831/161/21 concerning Kesko
Oyj, the retention period of personal data has been assessed, which at the time of the decision had not yet become disproportionately long in relation to the purposes of use of the data, and a penalty fee has therefore not been imposed.24. It should be noted that, with regard to the decision practice of other Member States,
for example, the Swedish supervisory authority (IMY) has intervened in a procedure similar to that at issue in the present case.
On 29 August 2024, the Swedish supervisory authority imposed an administrative penalty fee on two pharmacies for transmitting information on over-the-counter medicines and, for example, on sexual health products to Metal. Apohem AB, with a turnover of approximately EUR 52 million, was imposed a penalty of SEK 8 million (approximately EUR 696,000) and the state-owned Apoteket AB, with a turnover of approximately EUR 2 billion, was imposed a penalty of SEK 37 million (approximately EUR 3.2 million). Assessment of the seriousness of the infringement25. Taking into account the grounds set out in more detail below as a whole, the Penalty Board considers that the conditions for imposing a penalty are met.26. The assessment of the seriousness of the infringement of the General Data Protection Regulation has taken into account Article 83(2)(a), (b) and (g) of the General Data Protection Regulation. Nature and duration of the infringement27. Regarding the duration of the infringement, the Sanctions Board noted that, based on the investigation received, the controller has mainly removed the monitoring services assessed in this matter from its online pharmacy website by September 2022. The decision of the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner shows that, based on the investigation underway, the controller has used Google's monitoring services on its online pharmacy website since May 2015, i.e. the controller has transmitted personal data related to medicines to Google since the start of the application period of the General Data Protection Regulation.\[70\] According to the controller, the most significant Google monitoring service, i.e. Google Analytics, was removed from the online pharmacy website on 14 April 2022, i.e. before the investigation work of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner began.\[71\] According to the controller, the Meta pixel (formerly Facebook pixel) has been
deactivated from the entire online pharmacy website on 8 September 2022. According to the controller, the said
tracking pixel has been put into use on the pharmaceutical website either on 1 October 2020 or 21 March 2021, i.e. the controller has been transmitting personal data related to medicines to
Met (formerly: Facebook) for at least about a year and a half.
The breach assessed in this case has, in its main parts, lasted
for approximately four years during the period of application of the General Data Protection Regulation. 28. The Sanctions Board notes with regard to the nature of the breach that
the breach has been a matter of the controller's usual and
planned operation. The controller has used the monitoring services assessed in this case
on its online pharmacy website, for example, to obtain analytics data,
such as information on purchases made via the Facebook social service.
The controller, as described in more detail in the decision of the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, has not properly addressed
the fact that personal data related to medicines is transmitted to the monitoring service providers in this way,
if the online pharmacy visitor
accepts the use of cookies. 29. On the grounds set out above, the nature and duration of the infringement shall be considered as a factor in favour of imposing an administrative penalty. The nature, scope or purpose of the data processing and the personal data groups affected by the infringement 30. According to the report received from the controller on 20 September 2024, in 2021, the University Pharmacy website was visited by an estimated \[number deleted\] devices per week. According to the controller, this number is an average estimate and an individual sample, which can vary greatly between different years and months. According to the controller, based on its measurement, approximately 20–30% of the visitors to the University Pharmacy website completely prohibit the use of cookies. According to the controller's report, the monthly average of medicine orders in the period 2018–2024 has been approximately \[number deleted\] orders per month, and in 2018–2022, a total of \[number deleted\] orders have been made.\[72\] According to the controller, it is typical for the same data subject to place several orders during the year, and orders for prescription medicines in particular are frequent. Based on the report, the number of people who have visited the controller's pharmacy website each year, who have at least indicated an intention to purchase a medicine,\[73\] and thus the number of data subjects whose data protection rights have been at risk in the way assessed in this decision, can in any case be considered to exceed the limit of \[number deleted\] data subjects. Based on the information available on the number of data subjects, it is therefore clear that the group of data subjects has not been small. The Sanctions Board states that the number of data subjects supports the imposition of a penalty payment in this case. 31. Given the number of data subjects and the fact that this is an online activity in which identifiable information is collected from the various actions of the website visitor, the amount of personal data processed by the controller must also be considered to be large. 32. As further explained in the decision of the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, the infringement has concerned the processing of data that is considered to be of a very private nature\[74\]. The controller has provided monitoring service providers with information that indicates, for example, browsing for a specific over-the-counter medicine and the intention to order the over-the-counter medicine in question, or browsing for a specific prescription medicine and the intention to order the prescription medicine in question. Browsing data, when combined with information indicating purchase intention, can, for example, be used to deduce what medications a person may be taking, or what ailments or illnesses they have.33. The nature and scope of the data processing and the categories of personal data affected by the breach support the imposition of a penalty payment. Intention or negligence of the breach 34. The aforementioned guidelines issued by the European Data Protection Board and the Working Party have stated that intention generally requires a knowing and intentional breach. Intentional breaches, which demonstrate a disregard for the law, are generally considered to be more serious than negligent breaches.\[75\] 35. It should be noted that a controller may be penalised for a procedure falling within the scope of the GDPR if the controller could not have been unaware that its procedure was unlawful, regardless of whether it was aware that it was infringing the provisions of the GDPR.\[76\] In its case-law, the Court of Justice of the European Union refers specifically to the assessment of intent and negligence under competition law\[77\], which must be distinguished from the assessment of intent and negligence under criminal law.36. The Sanctions Panel concludes, for the reasons set out below, that the case cannot be considered to involve an infringement that is not the result of the controller's conduct being intentional or negligent.\[78\] 37. The Sanctions Board draws particular attention to the fact that, in connection with the introduction of the procedure, the controller has consciously and deliberately decided to transmit information about the website visitor's actions, including interest in and purchase intention for medicines, to tracking service providers.38. Based on the investigation into the decision of the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, the controller has masked the invitations to the payment stage regarding information about medicines, in which it has left information visible in the case of both Google and Meta that the invitation concerns a purchase, and in the case of Google also information that the invitation concerns the purchase of a prescription medicine or an over-the-counter medicine. Even if the controller had tried to conceal information about medicines from other invitations,\[79\] it has not, based on the investigation received, ensured, for example by carefully testing, that information about medicines is not transmitted to tracking service providers. As stated in the decision of the Deputy Data Protection Supervisor, Article 32(1)(d) of the General Data Protection Regulation explicitly requires that the controller shall implement a procedure to regularly test, examine and assess the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of data processing, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.39. The controller has also stated in its report that the Facebook marketing service (Meta for Business) has been inadvertently used on prescription medicine websites, and the Meta pixel related to this procedure has been disabled in connection with the investigation work of the Data Protection Supervisor's office on 8 September 2022. Based on the report received, the controller has not acted with due care in these respects and has not checked what data is being processed through the Meta service.40. The Sanctions Board notes that the case does not concern the fact that the infringement has occurred even though the controller has acted with care. 41. The Sanctions Board notes that it is not justified to consider that the controller's actions do not meet the requirement of Article 83(2)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation, according to which the conduct must be intentional or negligent. Assessment of aggravating and mitigating factors Measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage caused to the data subject 42. The Working Party's Guidelines on the application and imposition of administrative fines state that the party responsible for the damage should do everything in its power to mitigate the consequences of the infringement for the data subject. The supervisory authority may take into account such responsible actions or lack of responsible actions. 43. For the sake of clarity, the imposition of an administrative penalty payment does not require the existence of individual damage.\[80\] This is not an assessment of the grounds for imposing damages.44. The Penalty Panel notes that the controller has removed the Google and Meta services from its website in connection with the investigation by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and has asked the service providers to remove the information obtained through monitoring. In principle, this could be assessed as a mitigating factor. Although the controller has taken measures regarding these services, it has installed other monitoring services on its website with similar shortcomings and has continued to transmit information about medicines to monitoring service providers in URL addresses. In this case too, the information has not been properly masked or otherwise protected in all respects, for example, as required by Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation. The modus operandi means, for example, that information about medicines that can be linked to the data subject may, as further specified in paragraph 132 of the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner's decision, continue to be used by unknown intermediaries in an uncontrolled manner. The Sanctions Board considers that there are no mitigating or aggravating grounds in this regard. Degree of liability, taking into account the technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 45. In the case in question, the controller has systematically breached its obligations under Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 of the GDPR. The technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller cannot be considered sufficient in this regard. The case demonstrates a general deficiency in the practices laid down in the GDPR and there are no mitigating circumstances in this regard. Previous similar infringements and previously imposed measures on the same matter 46. The controller has not previously been subject to the powers referred to in Article 58(2) of the GDPR. There are no aggravating circumstances in this regard. Degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and the manner in which the infringement came to the attention of the supervisory authority 47. The aforementioned Working Party Guidelines on the application and imposition of administrative fines have stated that the degree of cooperation may be duly taken into account when deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount.
When assessing cooperation with the supervisory authority, importance could be attached to whether the controller has responded to the supervisory authority's requests during the investigation of the matter in a way that has significantly limited the risk to the rights of individuals. However, according to the guidelines, it would not be appropriate to emphasize the cooperation already required by law. 48. It should be noted that, as provided for in Article 31 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the controller must cooperate with the supervisory authority upon request in order to carry out its tasks. 
The controller is also obliged to provide the requested information to the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation and Section 18 of the Data Protection Act. 49. As stated above, it is not appropriate to emphasize the cooperation already required by law in the assessment of the matter. It is not appropriate to consider compliance with a statutory obligation as a mitigating factor in this case.50. The supervisory authority has been informed of the infringement through a notification by a third party. There are no mitigating factors in this regard. Possible other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the case 51. The above-mentioned guidelines of the Data Protection Working Party on the application and imposition of administrative fines have stated that possible other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the case may, for example, be the benefit or financial advantage gained from the infringement.52. Online monitoring is a practice that benefits the controller's economic activities. Through online monitoring, the controller obtains, for example, information on what online store customers do on its website and what products (such as medicines in this case) they show interest in. The information can be used for, for example, business development and marketing and other sales promotion aimed at the data subjects who are the subject of the monitoring.53. In its report on the decision of the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, the controller has explicitly stated that it has used the information obtained through the monitoring, for example, in its Facebook marketing aimed at customers.54. It cannot therefore be assumed in this case that the controller would not have benefited financially at all from the use of the online monitoring assessed in this case and its extension to medicines. 55. The Sanctions Board states that, based on the overall assessment, there are no aggravating grounds in this regard.56. The sanctioning board took into account as a mitigating factor that, based on the investigation received in the case, the controller's revenues are used for education and research. The decision to impose an administrative sanction was made by the members of the sanctioning board of the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman.

According to the controller, Google Tag Manager has been deactivated on 8 September 2022, Google Analytics has been deactivated on 14 April 2022 (i.e. before the investigation by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner began) and the Meta-pixel has been deactivated on 8 September 2022.17. Calls prior to the order confirmation phase.18. By combining the unique identification information transmitted about the user and information from different websites visited.19. For example: subcontractors in the processing chain, unknown to the controller.20. For example, by removing identifiers from the data stream in advance, by recycling the invitations through the controller's own service. 21. The information transmitted in the invitations can also be seen, for example, if it is a mobile device. Mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, are most often personal devices and can therefore easily be linked to an individual.22. The IP address has been found to be personal data in several decisions of the European Union's courts; see, for example, cases C-70/10, C-582/14, C-470/21 and T-354/22. See also recital 30 of the General Data Protection Regulation:
“Natural persons can be linked to online identifiers of the devices,
applications, tools and protocols they use, such as
IP addresses, cookies or other identifiers, for example
radio frequency identifiers. This can leave traces of the user that can
be used for profiling and identifying natural persons, in particular
when they are linked to unique identifiers and other information provided to servers”.23. A data collection method that creates a digital
fingerprint for the user based on, for example, the characteristics and technical
settings of his or her browser. Digital fingerprints are created based on data points of the user’s device
or online behaviour, and the fingerprint can be used to distinguish different devices and users from each other.24. The controller has also stated in its report that Meta links
data to users who have registered for the services provided by Meta (see decision point 26 for more details).25. C-604/22, paragraph 39 of the judgment: “As the Court of Justice has already held, the use of the word ‘indirectly’ by the EU legislature indicates that the classification of data as personal data does not require that that data alone enable the identification of the data subject. On the contrary, it is apparent from Article 4(5) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with recital 26 thereof, that personal data which can be linked to a specific natural person by means of additional information are to be regarded as data relating to an identifiable natural person”. See also, for example, Case C-582/14, paragraph 41.26 of the judgment. C-604/22, paragraph 41 of the judgment: “It follows that the concept of personal data covers not only data collected and stored by the controller but also all data resulting from the processing of personal data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person”. See also, for example, the Working Party's Guidance on Profiling, WP251, according to which the data subject's right to access his or her personal data covers both the input data and the completed personal profile (Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling for the Implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, adopted on 3 October 2017, last revised and approved on 6 February 2018, p. 18).27. Points 61 and 62 of the Decision.28. Screenshot submitted by the controller to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman on 4 December 2024.29. However, in the impact assessment of the e-commerce platform submitted to the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman, the controller states that: "In YA's e-commerce, health data clearly includes information on prescription and over-the-counter medicines". The controller also states in its report to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner that it “is aware that the medical data of the data subjects are in themselves special categories of personal data”.30. See, in this regard, the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-21/23, paragraphs 76 and 81. See also the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Cases C-101/01 (paragraph 50 of the judgment) and C-184/20 (paragraph 125 of the judgment) on the broad interpretation of the concept of health data. The Court of Justice of the European Union has assessed the nature of information on the purchase of medicines as health data in its case C-21/23: \[…\] where information on the purchase of medicines can be used to draw conclusions about the health status of an identified or identifiable person, it must be considered as health data within the meaning of Article 4(15) of the General Data Protection Regulation” (paragraph 78 of the judgment).31. See, for example, the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in cases C-184/20 (paragraph 83 of the judgment) and C-204/21 (paragraph 344 of the judgment).32. Duodecim Terveyskirjasto (www.terveyskirjasto.fi), accessed on 18.12.2024.33. Duodecim Terveyskirjasto (www.terveyskirjasto.fi), accessed on 18.12.202434. Paragraph 88 of the judgment. As stated in the judgment, information on over-the-counter medicines may be health data regardless of who is the actual user of the medicine.35. European Data Protection Board (EDPB) Guidelines 8/2020 on targeting of social media users, version 2.0, adopted 13.
April 2021, paragraph 125. The same paragraph is included in the previous version of the guidelines, published on 2 September 2020 (paragraph 118). The Court of Justice of the European Union has, in its recent case-law, expressly stated that the prohibition under Article 9(1) of the GDPR is not affected by the accuracy of the information resulting from the processing in question and that “\[…\] where a user of an online platform provides personal data when ordering medicinal products which may be sold only in pharmacies and which do not require a prescription, the processing of those data by the operator of the pharmacy selling those medicinal products via that online platform must be regarded as processing of data on health within the meaning of Article 8(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article 9(1) of the GDPR, since that processing of personal data may reveal information relating to the health of a natural person, whether that information concerns that user or any other person for whom he places the order” (Case C-21/23, paragraphs 87 and 88 of the judgment). See also, for example, Case C-446/21 (paragraph 73 of the judgment) and Case C-252/21 (paragraph 69 of the judgment).36. See on the right to rectify personal data that has been mistakenly identified as data relating to another person, Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-434/16, paragraph 54 of the judgment. See also on incorrect data as personal data, New Data Protection Legislation (Alma Talent, Helsinki
2018), p. 55.37. As set out in more detail above in this judgment, the tracking service providers may also have received information that the website visitor, for example, after adding a medicine to the shopping cart, made a purchase and ended up on the order confirmation page of the controller's online pharmacy during the same session, from which the tracking service provider can conclude that the website visitor has purchased a specific medicine. As described above, information on browsing and purchase intentions for medicines and, for example, the user's landing on an online pharmacy's order confirmation page can be linked to an identifiable person.38. The Court of Justice of the European Union has highlighted in its case law that web browsing data can be data belonging to special categories of personal data: "The processing carried out by Meta Platforms Ireland at issue in the main proceedings consists, first, of collecting personal data of users of the Facebook social network when they visit websites or applications - including those which may reveal data belonging to one or more categories of data referred to in Article 9(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation \[...\]" (Case C-252/21, paragraph 71 of the decision).39. It is possible to link different calls using, for example, a unique identifier, an IP address, a browser fingerprint, the time of day or an ID parameter.40. See similarly, the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in case
C-184/20, paragraphs 126–128 of the judgment.41. Due to the above, it cannot be ruled out that even if the browsed or purchased medicines are intended for other persons, these persons may be identifiable by the monitoring service provider.42. Paragraph 89 of the judgment.43. See HE 107/2021 vp, p. 106: “A pharmacist and a pharmacist are legalized professionals in accordance with the Act on Healthcare Professionals (559/1994), who are also subject to a confidentiality obligation pursuant to Section 17 of the Act”.44. HE 33/1994 vp, p. 34.45. The confidentiality obligation does not mean that the controller could not legally use personal data processors.46. For example, by implementing analytics on its own servers, or by integrating external analytics services into the service, where personal data effectively remains under the control of the controller.47. See the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in case C-340/21, paragraph 42 of the judgment. See also, for example, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) Guidelines 4/2019 on data protection by design and by default pursuant to Article 25, version 2.0, issued on 20 October 2020, paragraph 85.48. Pharmacists are, for example, subject to the obligation of confidentiality under the Medicines Act (395/1987), see for more information, paragraph 120.49 of this decision. See, for example, Recital 51 of the GDPR: “Personal data which are particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms should be protected in a particularly strict manner, since the context in which they are processed could result in significant risks to fundamental rights and freedoms”. 50. For example, in its response to the consultation of 23 January 2025, the controller states that “the primary purpose of the masking carried out by YA is to mask the information relating to the purchase transaction”. 51. See for more details on the merging of invitations in paragraph 116 of this Decision and footnote 39. 52. The burden of proof that personal data are processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security within the meaning of Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 of the GDPR lies with the controller, see Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case
C-340/21, paragraph 52 of the judgment. The risk-based approach to the processing of personal data is one of the main principles of data protection regulation, and is also provided for, for example, in Article 24 of the General Data Protection Regulation.53. Effective protection of personal data relating to medicines is also a way of operating in accordance with the principle of fairness of processing (Article 5(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation). It is in accordance with the reasonable expectations of online pharmacy customers that the controller protects their medicinal data with particular care and diligence from access by third parties.54. The controller has also selected companies whose business model is based to a significant extent on the collection of personal data and profiling of people as processors of information relating to medicines. See also, for example, Article 28(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation on the responsibility of the controller in the selection of the processor.55. See, for example, Cases C-70/10, C-582/14, C-470/21, C-604/22 and T-354/22. See
on the use of an IP address to trace the browsing path of an internet user
e.g. Joined Cases C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, paragraph
153.56. See also in this regard the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-140/20, paragraph
125. The said judgment states that the Court of Justice of the European Union clarifies and specifies the meaning of a legal provision in the way that the legal provision should always have been interpreted, and the interpretation of the Court of Justice of the European Union extends to the date of entry into force of the interpreted provision. Taking this into account, the controller cannot wait for the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union and not, until then, apply a proper risk-based approach to the processing of personal data. It is also clear that the type of cases that are brought before the courts depends on the circumstances.57. See the previous decision section (On the obligations relating to the protection of personal data) for more information on the assessment under Article 32 of the GDPR.58. The transfer of data to New Relic is also not necessary to identify the country from which the web traffic has come to the controller's website, but the controller could have done the same without transferring the data to third parties.59. Browsing data is personal data, see e.g. the website of the European Data Protection Board: “Examples of personal data include: browsing history”
https://www.edpb.europa.eu/sme-data-protection-guide/faq-frequently-asked-questions/answer/what-personal-data\_en
(accessed 7.3.2025).60. See also stated in the pharmacist's confidentiality obligations (decision point 120).
The confidentiality obligation does not mean that the controller could not use personal data processors at all.61. In the Customer Data Act, customer data refers to both patient data and social care customer data (section 3.1, paragraph 6 of the Customer Data Act). 62. It is clear from Article 83(4) to (6) of the General Data Protection Regulation, which concern the calculation of administrative fines imposed for the infringements listed in those points, that if the subject of an administrative fine is an undertaking referred to in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU or a part thereof, the maximum amount of the administrative fine is calculated as a percentage of the total annual worldwide turnover of the undertaking in question in the preceding financial year (see also recital 150 of the General Data Protection Regulation). The amount of the administrative penalty imposed in the case is thus calculated according to the total turnover of the University Pharmacy Group.63. For example, measured by the amount of turnover. 64. This has also been stated on the controller's own website: "Finland's largest online pharmacy ya.fi serves all kinds of pharmacy matters nationwide and you can find all the most popular pharmacy products in the wide selection" (https://www.yliopistonapteekki.fi/, website visited on 23.5.2025).65. HE 9/2018 vp, p. 105.66. HE 9/2018 vp, p. 56–57. 67. The decision p. 6. The Supreme Administrative Court has overturned the aforementioned administrative court decision on other grounds (KHO:2018:167).68.

The General Data Protection Regulation has been applied since 25 May 2018.71. For example, Google Fonts have been removed since 8 September 2022.72. Considering that the General Data Protection Regulation has been applied since
25.5.2018 and Google and Meta tracking technologies have been largely removed
at the beginning of September 2022, the number of medicine orders during this period has been approximately
\[number information removed\].73. Adding a medicine to the shopping cart, pressing the order prescription medicine button.74. See for information to be taken into account, e.g. European Data Protection Board Guideline
4/2022: “With regard to the requirement to take into account the categories of personal data affected by the breach in accordance with Article 83(2)(g) of the GDPR, the GDPR clearly highlights which types of data require specific protection and a more stringent response in terms of fines. This applies at least to the types of data falling within the scope of Articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR and to data falling outside the scope of those Articles, the dissemination of which would cause direct harm or inconvenience to the data subject”

57).75. EDPB Guidelines: Guidelines 4/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (version 2.1, adopted on 24 May 2023), paragraphs 55 and 56.

See judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-683/21, paragraph 81.77. See judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-683/21 (paragraph 81) and in Case C-807/21 (paragraph 76).78. See on intent and negligence, e.g. judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Cases C-683/21 and C-807/21.79. For example, the controller states in its response to the consultation of 23 January 2025 that “the primary purpose of the masking carried out by YA is to mask the information relating to the purchase transaction”.80. See also the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in case C-300/21, paragraph 40 of the judgment.
