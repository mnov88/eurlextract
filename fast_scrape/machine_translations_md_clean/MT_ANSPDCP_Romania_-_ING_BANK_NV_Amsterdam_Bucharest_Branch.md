A new penalty for breaching GDPR

In June of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator ING BANK NV Amsterdam Bucharest Branch, in which it found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b), paragraph (2) and par. (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, ING BANK NV Amsterdam Bucharest Branch was fined 14,889 lei, the equivalent of 3,000 EURO.

The investigation was started as a result of the transmission by the operator of a notification of a breach of the security of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation.

During the conducted investigation, it was found that there was an unauthorized transmission, through the WhatsApp application, of a .pdf format file containing personal data.

This situation led to the loss of confidentiality of the personal data of a significant number of the operator's customers.

Thus, the National Supervisory Authority found that ING BANK NV Amsterdam Bucharest Branch did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of security corresponding to the risk of processing, generated, in particular, accidentally or illegally, by the destruction, loss , modification, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to personal data stored or otherwise processed.

We emphasize that, according to art. 32 para. (4) of the General Regulation on Data Protection, the operator had the obligation to take measures to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the operator and who has access to personal data only processes them at the request of the operator.
