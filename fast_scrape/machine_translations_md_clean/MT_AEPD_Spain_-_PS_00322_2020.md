## English Summary

### Facts

The respondent, a law firm, sent an email to multiple recipients without putting them in bcc. The complainant was one of the recipients.

### Dispute

Does sending an email without putting the recipients in bcc constitute a violation of the GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held that the email constituted a confidentiality breach and violated Article 32 GDPR, as the law firm had failed to ensure the security of the recipients’ email addresses and other personal data. They also held that the sending of the email violated the principle of data integrity, security and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

For the violation of Article 32, the AEPD issued the law firm with a reprimand and an order to bring the processing in line with the GDPR, pursuant to Articles 58(2)(b) and (d) respectively.

For the violation of Article 5(1)(f), it issued a fine of €10000, pursuant to Article 58(2)(i). The negligent behaviour of the law firm and the categories of data (emails, names, surnames) affected by the breach were aggravating factors for the fine.

The law firm ultimately paid €6000 for the breach, by applying two reductions offered under Spanish law, for the voluntary payment of the fine and for recognising their responsibility in the breach. By applying the reduction, the respondents waived their right to appeal or take other actions against the complaint.

                             FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                              II

        The RGPD establishes in article 5 the principles that must govern the treatment
of personal data and mentions among them that of "integrity and confidentiality".

        The article notes that:

        "1. The personal data will be:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/3

        (…)

        f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security for the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and

against their loss, destruction or accidental damage, by applying measures
appropriate technical or organizational ('integrity and confidentiality') ”.

        In turn, the security of personal data is regulated in article 32
of the RGPD.

        Article 32 of the RGPD "Security of treatment", establishes that:

        "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the

nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the controller and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and

appropriate organizational arrangements to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,
that in your case include, among others:

        a) pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;

        b) the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and
        permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;

        c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
        personnel quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

        d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
        of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the safety of the
        treatment.

        2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, the
take into account the risks presented by the data processing, in particular as

consequence of accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of data
personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/12

        3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved in accordance with article 40 or to a

certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the

this article.

        4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to

ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the
manager and have access to personal data can only process said data
following instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the

Law of the Union or of the Member States ”.

        The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is typified in article

83.4.a) of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:

        "4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance

with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 10 000 000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the

total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

        a) the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to articles 8,
11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.

        (…) "

        For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infractions, states that:
“The acts and conducts referred to in sections 4,

5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those resulting
contrary to the present organic law ”.

        And in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, qualifies as "Infractions
considered serious ”:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/12

        "Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a

substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

        (…)

        g) The breach, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence,
of the technical and organizational measures that have been implemented in accordance with
required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ”.

                                             III

        The facts revealed in this claim are specified in
the receipt by the claimant, of an email without hidden copy
sent by the claimed to dozens of recipients, including the claimant.

        The RGPD defines personal data security violations as
“All those security violations that cause destruction, loss or

accidental or illegal alteration of personal data transmitted, kept or processed
otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to said data ”.

        From the documentation in the file there are clear indications of
that the respondent has violated article 32 of the RGPD, due to a breach of

security in your systems by sending an email without blind copy, to eight
recipients, including the claimant, who are informed of the blocking of their accounts.

        It should be noted that the RGPD in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of
the security measures that are applicable according to the data that are
object of treatment, but establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the

treatment will apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk
involved in the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
application, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of

probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/12

       Likewise, security measures must be adequate and

proportionate to the risk detected, noting that the determination of the measures
technical and organizational must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and
encryption, the ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and

resilience, the ability to restore availability and access to data after a
incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the
effectiveness of the measures.

       In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the security level, the
particularly take into account the risks presented by data processing, such as

consequence of accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of data
personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data and that could cause damages

physical, material or immaterial.

       In this same sense, recital 83 of the RGPD states that:

“(83) In order to maintain security and prevent the treatment from violating the provisions of
this Regulation, the person in charge or the person in charge must assess the risks

inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as encryption. These
Measures should ensure an adequate level of security, including
confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application

with respect to the risks and the nature of the personal data that must
protect yourself. When assessing risk in relation to data security, you should

take into account the risks derived from the processing of personal data,
such as accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of personal data
transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or access does not

authorized to said data, susceptible in particular to cause damages
physical, material or immaterial ”.

                                           IV

       In accordance with the evidence available and without prejudice to the

resulting from the instruction, from the documentation provided it appears that on 19
April 2020, the defendant sends an email without blind copy to dozens of

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12

recipients, including the claimant, which could constitute, on the part of the claimed,
two offenses, one against the provisions of article 32 of the RGPD and another against

provided in article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, which governs the principles of integrity and
confidentiality of personal data, as well as the proactive responsibility of the

responsible for the treatment to demonstrate its compliance.

                                           V

       Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: “Each control authority
will have all of the following corrective powers listed below:

       b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with
warning when the processing operations have violated the provisions of

these Regulations;

       d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of

treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified time;

       i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition or in
place of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances

of each particular case;

                                           SAW

       Article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD states that “depending on what is established
Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and

The infractions that suppose a substantial violation will prescribe after three years

or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the

higher amount, in accordance with article 83.5 of the RGPD.
