## English Summary

### Facts

The Federal Press Office operated a fan page on the social network Facebook, provided by Meta Platforms Inc., where it provided information about current political activities of the Federal Government. When users visited the page, cookies could be placed on their end devices.

In 2023, the Federal DPA (BfDI) prohibited the Federal Press Office from operating its fan page because the design of the cookie banner used by Meta was not GDPR compliant. It held that the Federal Press Office was regarded a joint controller, together with Meta, responsible for ensuring that the data processing regarding cookies was based on a sufficient legal basis such as consent. Therefore, not only Meta, but also the Federal Press Office, as the operator of the fan page, was legally obliged to obtain the consent of the respective visitor.

  
Both the Federal Government and Meta appealed against the DPA's decision addressed to the Federal Press Office before the court of first instance (Cologne Administrative Court-VG Cologne).

### Holding

The court held that under the GDPR, Meta and the Federal Press Office were not joint controllers for the contested data processing. Meta was solely responsible for obtaining the consent of visitors of the fan page for the placement of cookies.

  
It ruled that the Federal Press Office's contribution to the storage and reading of cookies was limited to the operation of the page. In particular, the Federal Press Office could not specify any parameters for the placement of the cookies and the analysis of the data collected. In the opinion of the court, the mere facilitation of data processing does not constitute the necessary joint determination of the means of data processing.

Consequently, the Press and Information Office of the Federal Government was permitted to continue operating its Facebook fan page.

The decision below is a machine translation of the German original. Please refer to the German original for more details.

The Federal Press and Information Office may continue operating its Facebook fan page. The Cologne Administrative Court ruled this following an oral hearing on July 17, 2025, thus upholding the lawsuits filed by the federal government and "Meta" (formerly "Facebook") against the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Information Security (BfDI).
 
The Federal Press Office operates a fan page on the social network Facebook. There, it provides information about the Federal Government's current political activities. When users visit the fan page, so-called "cookies" may be placed on their devices.
 
In 2023, the BfDI prohibited the Federal Press Office from operating its Facebook page ("fan page") due to violations of the law, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Federal Office for Information and Digital Infrastructure (BfDI) argued that, due to the non-compliant design of the "cookie banner" used by "Meta," there was no valid consent for the storage and reading of certain "cookies." Not only "Meta," but also the Federal Press Office, as the operator of the "fan page," is legally obligated to obtain the consent of the respective user. Furthermore, the Federal Press Office, together with "Meta," is responsible for ensuring that data processing is based on a sufficient legal basis, such as consent.
 
Both the Federal Government and "Meta" have filed lawsuits against the decision addressed to the Federal Press Office, which the court has now largely upheld. The court essentially stated the following reasoning:

Meta alone, not the Federal Press Office, is obligated to obtain the consent of end users for the placement of "cookies." There is no sufficient cause-and-effect relationship between the operation of the "fan page" by the Federal Press Office and the remote access to users' devices associated with the storage and reading of "cookies." While cookies can be placed when visiting a "fan page," they can also be placed when visiting any other "Facebook page."
Even under the GDPR, "Meta" and the Federal Press Office are not jointly responsible for the data processing operations complained of. The Federal Press Office's contribution to the storage and reading of cookies is limited to the operation of the "fan page." In particular, the Federal Press Office cannot specify parameters for the placement of cookies or the evaluation of the collected data. However, in the Chamber's opinion, merely enabling data processing does not justify the necessary joint determination of the means of data processing.
 
The court has granted leave to appeal, which the Higher Administrative Court for the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, based in Münster, would decide if the parties appeal.
