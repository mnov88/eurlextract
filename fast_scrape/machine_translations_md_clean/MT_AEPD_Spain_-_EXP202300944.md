## English Summary

### Facts

On 7 December 2022, a data subject filed a complaint with the AEPD against Caixabank (the controller). The controller required new clients to sign a contract for provision of services, which included a clause stating that data subjects consent to their data being requested from the General Treasury of Social Security. For existing clients, the same clause was included in a declaration or modification contract. The provision cited Law 10/2010, a Spanish law on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, stating that it required the collection of such data. For both new and existing clients, the contract did not give an option to refuse consent – instead, consent was pre-established by the clause. 3,026,247 new clients signed the contract, and 3,401,052 existing clients signed the modification contract.

The data subject claimed that, after they expressed their disagreement, the controller stated that failure to sign the form with these clauses would result in the bank account being blocked.

On 30 January 2023, the AEPD informed the controller of the complaint. In its defense brief, the controller stated that it is required by [Law 10/2010](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2010-6737). In particular, it pointed to Article 11, which obliges financial institutions to guarantee that they are engaging with professional or business activities of the client. The controller interpreted this to mean that the identification of the client was necessary, as well as the collection of information concerning the client’s professional or business activities.

### Holding

The AEPD concluded that consent was improperly obtained in this case and the controller thus lacked a legal basis for processing. The AEPD proposed a fine of €2,000,000. The controller acknowledged responsibility of the violations and paid a portion of proposed fine; thus, the fine was reduced 40% to €1,200,000.

The AEPD acknowledged that [Law 10/2010](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2010-6737) requires banks to verify professional and business activities of its clients. However, it noted that the law does not specify how a bank is to assess this data; instead, the controller decides on the form of verification, and it should do so in a way that complies with data protection regulations. The [Convention](https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2018-5203) established between the General Treasury for Social Security and the Spanish Association of Financial Entities, which guides financial institutions on compliance with Law 10/2010, also does not establish an obligation to verify personal data with the General Treasury of Social Security.

There was thus no legal obligation requiring the controller to collect its clients’ personal data from the General Treasury of Social Security. However, insofar as this was the method chosen by a controller to comply with Law 10/2010, the AEPD noted that the [sixth clause of Annex III of the Convention](https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2018-5203) explicitly requires data subject consent in order for the controller to verify their personal data with the General Treasury of Social Security.

The AEPD found that consent was not properly obtained in this case. As a result, the controller lacked a legal basis for processing pursuant to [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"). The AEPD emphasized that consent is not free when the data subject cannot refuse consent without suffering any damage, or when the fulfillment of a contract or provision of service is dependent on consent even when it is not necessary for the service. In this case, consent was not free because it was included as a non-negotiable aspect of the controller’s contract. Additionally, the controller failed to obtain specific consent in each case where data was being processed for different purposes -- instead, it combined consent to processing for the provision of banking services with consent to processing of the data subject’s data from the General Treasury of Social Security. Finally, consent was not informed because it was presented as a requirement rather than an option within the contract, and because the clause falsely stated that the controller was obligated to process the personal data under national law.

Given these violations, the AEPD resolved to initiate sanction proceedings against the controller and recommended a sanction of € 2,000,000.

Pursuant to [Law 39/2015](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10565), a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €1,200,000.

## Comment

[Law 39/2015](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10565), a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, permits a controller to acknowledge responsibility for an alleged violation or to pay a fine proposed by the AEPD in its investigation stage in exchange for a 20% reduction in the fine amount. These actions permit the reduction to stack -- thus, if a controller both acknowledges responsibility and pays the fine prior to the AEPD's final sanction proceedings, then the fine amount is reduced 40%.

FIFTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool, the entity

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD grants to each authority of
control and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

Spanish Data Protection.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/26

in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

                                           II
                                  Previous issues

In accordance with the provisions of article 4.2 of the GDPR, "processing" means:
any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or

sets of personal data, whether by automated procedures or not, such as
the collection, registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or
modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or
any other form of access enablement, collation or interconnection, limitation,
deletion or destruction;

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.2 of the RGPD,
CAIXABANK is the one who processes the personal data of its clients,
collecting your personal data and consulting it with the TGSS.

To this end, it establishes a procedure for obtaining information with data

personal data of clients and collection of consent to verify said data
personal data before the TGSS, through a form called “framework contract”,
for cases of registration of new clients, and “form 5433 (Declaration/Modification
of data for the business relationship)”, for cases of updating the data
personal data of existing clients. Documents, both, mandatory subscription.

Therefore, in this procedure the established procedure will be analyzed
by CAIXABANK for the provision of consent to CAIXABANK clients
so that it can consult their personal data to verify the
obtained in response to the LPBCFT before the TGSS.

                                           III
                                 Article 6.1 of the GDPR

According to article 6 of the GDPR “Legitimacy of processing:

1. Treatment will only be legal if at least one of the following is met
conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data

for one or more specific purposes;

b) the processing is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/26

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or another
Physical person;

e) the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the controller;

 f) the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that regarding said
interests do not prevail over the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the

interested party requiring the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child. The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not be
application to the processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their
functions.”

In this case, CAIXABANK states that the verification of the personal data of its
clients before the TGSS, obtained in compliance with the obligations imposed by the
LPBCFT, is a consequence of the legal obligation imposed by Law 10/2010, of 28
April, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing
(LPBCFT), which includes in its article 2, the obligated subjects in the Prevention of
Money Laundering: Financial Entities (banks, savings banks, cooperatives

credit, etc.), Insurance Companies, Credit Institutions, etc.

In this sense, this same law regulates in its article 5, that “the obligated subjects
They will collect information from their clients in order to know the nature of their activity
professional or business and will adopt measures aimed at reasonably verifying
the veracity of said information.

Such measures will consist of the establishment and application of procedures for
verification of activities declared by clients. These procedures

will take into account the different level of risk and will be based on obtaining the
clients of documents that are related to the declared activity or in the
obtaining information about it that is not related to the client himself.” (emphasis added)

Adding in its article 6 that “The obligated subjects will apply security measures
continuous monitoring of the business relationship, including scrutiny of the
operations carried out throughout said relationship in order to guarantee that they coincide
with the knowledge that the obligated subject has of the client and his business profile

and risk, including the origin of funds and ensuring that documents, data and
information available are up to date.”

For its part, RD 304/2014, of May 5, which approves the Regulation of
Law 10/2010, of April 28, on the prevention of money laundering and
financing of terrorism, which is developed by the LPBCFT, establishes:

“Article 10. Purpose and nature of the business relationship.

1. The obligated subjects will collect information from their clients in order to know the
nature of your professional or business activity. The activity declared by the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/26

client will be registered by the obligated subject prior to the beginning of the relationship
of business.

2. The obligated subjects will verify the activities declared by the clients in
the following assumptions:

    a) When the client or the business relationship presents risks greater than the
average, by regulatory provision or because it appears from the risk analysis
of the obligated subject.

    b) When the monitoring of the business relationship shows that the operations
active or passive assets of the client do not correspond to their declared activity or their

operational background.

3. Actions to verify the declared professional or business activity
They will be graduated based on risk and will be carried out through documentation provided

by the client, or by obtaining information from reliable sources
independent. Likewise, obligated subjects will be able to verify the activity
professional or business of clients through in-person visits to the offices,
warehouses or premises declared by the client as places where they carry out their activity
commercial, leaving a written record of the result of said visit.

(…)

Article 11. Continuous monitoring of the business relationship.

1. The obligated subjects will carry out a scrutiny of the operations carried out during
throughout the business relationship in order to ensure that they coincide with the activity
professional or business of the client and with its operational background. The subjects

obligated will increase monitoring when they appreciate risks higher than the
average by regulatory provision or because it appears from the risk analysis
of the obligated subject.

(…)

2. The obligated subjects will periodically carry out review processes in order to
ensure that the documents, data and information obtained as a consequence
of the application of due diligence measures are kept up to date and
find current.

(…)” (emphasis added)

In accordance with the aforementioned regulations, the treatment carried out by the entity
banking consists of, on the one hand, collecting information from clients in the terms

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/26

made explicit in the LPBCFT and, on the other hand, adopt measures aimed at verifying
reasonably the veracity of said information.

Thus, it is true that sector regulations determine the obligation to verify the

professional and business activities of the subjects with whom you are going to do
business. Not anticipating, however, that this should be done in a manner
determined, and must be the person responsible for the processing of personal data (in the
present case, CAIXABANK) who must decide such verification procedure, the
which must comply with the regulations on data protection

staff.

The Agreement signed with the TGSS on the transfer of information, to which it has adhered
CAIXABANK on April 28, 2021, in order to facilitate credit institutions the
compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, through a
mechanized computer procedure that allows establishing a daily process of

request for data by financial entities and transmission of
information from the TGSS, it could be an appropriate mechanism for the
fulfillment of its obligations but not necessarily unique.

In the sixth clause and in Annex III of the Agreement between the General Treasury of the
Social Security, the Spanish Banking Association, the Spanish Confederation of

Savings Banks and the National Union of Credit Cooperatives, on transfer of
information, to which CAIXABANK alludes in its writings, is evident
that the interested party must consent so that the banking entity can verify the
personal data before the TGSS and is effectively collected, the clause by which
can give express consent to verify the information.

But although this is the way in which the agreement considers that this
consent for the purposes of allowing verification in the TGSS systems,

This is not the only way to verify personal data, in the terms
aforementioned of the LPCBCFT and its implementing regulations.

The regulations do not establish the obligation to verify personal data information
before the TGSS, but is provided by the client and subsequently, taking into account the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/26

different level of risk, there is a general obligation to establish and apply
verification procedures for activities declared by clients.

Therefore, in order to consult personal data with the TGSS, given that the Law does not
does not impose this route on banking entities nor does it constitute a legal obligation
consultation with the TGSS, for the purposes of verification of data information
personal information provided by the claimant, it would be necessary to obtain the consent of the

interested party, not to impose the use of said mechanism, and always conditioned to the
specific cases in which the standard requires such verification.

In this sense, article 4.11 of the GDPR establishes that the “consent of the
interested party” is “any manifestation of free, specific, informed and

unequivocal statement by which the interested party accepts, either through a declaration or a
clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that concerns you”

Consent is understood as a clear affirmative act that reflects a
manifestation of free, specific, informed and unequivocal will of the interested party
accept the processing of personal data that concerns you, provided with
sufficient guarantees to prove that the interested party is aware of the fact that

you give your consent and to the extent to which you do so.

Likewise, it must be given for all treatment activities carried out with the
same or same purposes, so that, when the processing has several purposes, it must
give consent for all of them specifically and unequivocally. To this

In this regard, the legality of the treatment requires that the interested party be informed about the
purposes for which the data are intended (informed consent).

Furthermore, consent must be given freely. It is understood that the
consent is not free when the interested party does not enjoy true or free choice

or you cannot deny or withdraw your consent without suffering any damage, or when the
fulfillment of a contract or provision of service is dependent on the
consent, even when this is not necessary for said compliance. This
occurs when consent is included as a non-negotiable part of the
general conditions.

Without these conditions, the consent given by the interested party would not determine a
control over your personal data and its destination.

On the other hand, the European Data Protection Committee in the document “Guidelines
05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679”, which updates

the guidelines on consent adopted by the Article Working Group
29 on 11/28/2017, reviewed and approved on 04/10/2018 refers to this and indicates
that:

"3. In general, consent can only be an adequate legal basis if it is

When requesting consent, the data controller has the obligation to
evaluate whether said consent will meet all the requirements for obtaining a
valid consent. If obtained in full compliance with the GDPR, the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/26

Consent is a tool that gives data subjects control over whether the
personal data that concerns them will be processed or not. If not, the control
of the interested party will be merely illusory and consent will not be a legal basis

valid for the treatment, which will convert said treatment activity into a
illicit activity.

These guidelines go on to state:

“13. The term "free" implies real choice and control on the part of those concerned.

As a general rule, the GDPR establishes that, if the subject is not truly free to
choose, you feel obligated to give your consent or you will suffer negative consequences if
does not give it, then the consent cannot be considered valid. If the
consent is included as a non-negotiable part of the conditions
It is generally assumed that it has not been freely given. Consequently, it is not

consent will be considered to have been freely given if the interested party cannot
deny or withdraw consent without prejudice.”

They also indicate:
“62. The GDPR reinforces the requirement that consent must be informed. Of
Pursuant to Article 5 of the GDPR, the transparency requirement is one of the

fundamental principles, closely related to the principles of loyalty and
legality. Providing information to interested parties before obtaining their consent is
essential so that they can make informed decisions, understand what
are authorizing and, for example, exercise their right to withdraw their consent. If he
responsible does not provide accessible information, the user's control will be illusory and

Consent will not constitute a valid basis for data processing.

63. If the requirements regarding informed consent are not met, the
consent will not be valid and the person responsible may be in breach of article 6
of the GDPR

64. For consent to be informed, it is necessary to inform the interested party
certain elements that are crucial to be able to choose. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that
At least the following information is required to obtain valid consent:

i the identity of the person responsible for the treatment.

ii the purpose of each of the processing operations for which the authorization is requested
consent.

iii what (type of) data is to be collected and used.

Iv the existence of the right to withdraw consent.

V information on the use of data for automated decision-making
in accordance with Article 22(2)(c) where applicable, and

I saw information about the possible risks of data transfer due to the
absence of a decision on the adequacy of adequate guarantees, as stated
described in article 46”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/26

In the present case, since CAIXABANK joined the agreement on April 28

from 2021 until the modifications of the procedure in 2023:

- Consent cannot be considered free because with the signing of the framework contract
or model 5433 is required for all clients to verify their data
personal data is carried out through consultation with the TGSS. This absolutely limits the

choice of such people to decide whether they want CAIXABANK to carry
carry out such verification of personal data through consultation with the TGSS, since
It is not mandatory, as stated.

- Likewise, consent must be given for all treatment activities

carried out for the same or same purposes, so that, when the treatment has
several purposes, consent must be given for all of them specifically and
unequivocal. But in the present case it cannot be considered specific and unambiguous
whenever the mechanisms for providing consent for clients of
CAIXABANK so that it can consult the personal data of its clients before

the TGSS, through the framework contract model and the model are already pre-established,
just as if it were a pre-checked box.

- Consent cannot be considered informed because:

       a) The framework contract, which the new clients signed, indicated, for a
side, which “gives its express consent to Caixabank so that on its behalf
We can request said information from the General Treasury of Social Security” if
well, section 4.5 of such contract does not include such treatment within section
regarding “Treatments based on consent”.

       b) Form 5433, which existing clients had to sign for the
update of his personal data, indicated that “The declarant states that he has
been informed by CaixaBank that the current legislation on prevention of
Money laundering forces banking entities to obtain from their clients the

information on your economic activity and to verify it.
For this exclusive purpose of verifying the information provided, lend your
express consent to CaixaBank so that on its behalf it can request the
General Treasury of Social Security said information.” Information that needs to be
add to what such people already had when they signed the aforementioned framework contract.

The information offered could cause confusion to an average citizen, because:

- It did not allow express consent, but consent was reflected in a
standard clause of the models to which it was obligatory to adhere.

- Such clause mentioned the legal obligations regarding LPBCFT.

- In the information that was given about the processing of personal data, as such
treatment was not expressly included in the treatments whose legal basis
was consent, it could be directly related to the treatments related to the
legal obligation on the LPBCFT, a rule referred to in the mod.los clause

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 18/26

Therefore, in accordance with the evidence available at this time
of agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to what
results from the instruction, it is considered that the known facts could be

constituting an infraction, attributable to the claimed party, for violation of the
article 6.1 of the RGPD in relation to the procedure that had been established
CAIXABANK to obtain the consent of its clients to verify
certain personal data related to the LPBCFT before TGSS.

                                           IV

                              Classification of the offense

The infringement attributed to CAIXABANK is classified in the article
83.5 a) of the RGPD, which considers that the violation of “the basic principles for the
processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to articles 5,

6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned article 83 of the
cited Regulation, “with administrative fines of a maximum of €20,000,000 or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount.”

The LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infractions, states that: “They constitute infractions
the acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this law
organic”.

And in its article 72, it considers for the purposes of prescription, which are: “Infringements
considered very serious:

1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that involve

a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:
(…)
b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

                                 Sanction proposal

In order to establish the administrative fine that should be imposed, the following must be observed:
provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, which indicate:

"1. Each supervisory authority will ensure that the imposition of fines
administrative sanctions under this article for violations of this
Regulations indicated in sections 4, 5 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, as an additional or substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/26

When deciding the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each case
individual will be duly taken into account:

 a) the nature, severity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
    nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
    such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
    have suffered;

 a) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

 b) any measure taken by the person responsible or in charge of the treatment to
    alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;

 c) the degree of responsibility of the person responsible or in charge of the treatment,
    taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have been applied in
    under articles 25 and 32;

 d) any previous infraction committed by the person responsible or in charge of the
    treatment;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the
infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;

 g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

 h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
particular whether the controller or processor notified the infringement and, if so, in what
extent;

i) when the measures indicated in Article 58, paragraph 2, have been ordered
previously against the person responsible or the person in charge in question in relation to the
same matter, compliance with said measures;

 j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to mechanisms of
certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and

 k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct or
indirectly, through infringement.”

In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its article 76,
“Sanctions and corrective measures” establishes that:

 "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:

 a) The continuous nature of the infringement.
b) The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of medical treatments.

c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.

d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected person could have induced the commission
of the infringement.
 e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the

infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.
 f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection delegate.
 h) The submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
"There are disputes between them and any interested party."

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, for the purposes of setting the amount of the fine sanction
impose in the present case for the infringement classified in article 83.5 of the RGPD of
for which the defendant is held responsible, in an initial assessment, it is estimated

the following factors concurrently:

As aggravating circumstances:

       (i) To 3,026,247 people who signed the framework contract.
       (ii) To 3,401,052 people who signed form 5433.

- The intention or negligence of the infringement (article 83.2. b) of the RGPD).
CAIXABANK joined the agreement with the TGSS on April 28, 2021, an agreement that

requires the financial entity, in its sixth clause, to have the corresponding
express authorization, signed by the interested party. However, they have demanded the
consent in an adhesion clause without real possibility of consent, being
fully aware of the requirements of the agreement signed with the TGSS.

In this sense, the SAN of October 17, 2007 (rec. 63/2006) is very illustrative,

which indicates that “…the Supreme Court has been understanding that there is imprudence

Thus, in accordance with section e) of article 83.2. GDPR, in determining the
amount of the administrative fine sanction cannot fail to be valued all
those previous infractions of the person responsible or of the person in charge of treatment in
