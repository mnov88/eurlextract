## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) stating that Telefonica – a telecommunications company – was still using their phone number and accessing their records to do trials in their call centres and shops. The data subject claimed that the controller had called them 247 calls in a span of two days, even after the controller had assured in previous proceedings that it had implemented adequate measures to prevent this from happening. The data subject continued to receive such calls after filing the complaint from a different number.

The data subject had exercised their right to object in 2017, what was confirmed by the controller in a letter that stated that they had taken adequate measures to prevent it.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA concluded that the controller had violated [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), as it had processed the personal data of the data subject without their consent, after they objected to such processing.

The controller acknowledged the facts and stated that they were implementing measures to prevent it from happening in the future.

The AEPD noted, however, that the controller had still made calls to the data subject after they filed the complaint. The DPA took into account the recidivism, as well as the continuous nature of the infringement, the basic categories of personal data affected, and the link between the infringement and its business core activity as aggravating factors.

Following this, the DPA fined Telefonica €75,000, that were reduced to €45,000 for acknowledgement of responsibility and early payment.

## Comment

This case is similar to [AEPD (Spain) - PS/00474/2020](/index.php?title=AEPD_\(Spain\)_-_PS/00474/2020 "AEPD (Spain) - PS/00474/2020"), in which the data subject also received around 250 unsolicited calls after having exercised their right to object – what was confirmed by the controller – in 2017.

consent, to carry out tests in their Call Centers and stores. In fact,
states that, in two days, he has received a total of 247 calls from number 1004, to

despite the fact that in the previous claims the defendant claimed to have implemented
new security measures so that it does not happen again.

       On April 10, 2021, the claimant expands his claim by stating
that he continues to receive calls from the defendant, but in this case from number 1002

(to move).

       Provides proof of your claim, the SMS received and the calls from the

1002 and 1004.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of the LOPGDD, which has provided for a

mechanism prior to the admission for processing of claims made before
the AEPD, consisting of transferring them to the Data Protection Delegates
designated by those responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the intended purposes

in article 37 of the aforementioned norm, or to these when it has not designated them, it was
transfer of the claim to the claimed entity to proceed with its analysis and

respond to the complaining party and this Agency within one month.

       As a result of this process, on March 30, 2021, the claimed

shows that "new control measures have been implemented,
maintaining in force and reinforcing the measures that had already been adopted

above regarding the use of the numbering \*\*\* TELEPHONE.1 ".

       They attach a copy of the letter sent to the claimant.

       On the other hand, it indicates that the claimant exercised his right of access which
was responded by letter on April 10, 2017.

       Next, they state: “who has analyzed the call log
provided by the claimant in this file, and notes that, after confirming

receipt of these, it has been detected that by mistake the claimant and his / her

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/3

numbering in a campaign organized by our company in order to
check the existence of technical failures that customers may suffer.

       Although security and control measures have been taken over the use of

this numbering since 2014, they have been strengthened and implemented
two new measures:

       On the one hand, and when verifying that these calls were made by a campaign
resolution of technical incidents, our team has proceeded to exclude the
numbering of the aforementioned campaigns.

       Additionally, the direct blocking measure has been taken in the
the aforementioned numbering so that, when a new one is programmed

campaign with similar characteristics, the numbering is identified and
automatically excluded.

       On the other hand, a fortnightly control of all our
customer databases to confirm that all measures applied since the

year 2014, they are applied correctly.

       Finally, despite the fact that the claimant in his writing when referring to “the

black list ”in which you have entered the telephone numbers of Telefónica, in the
moment when one of our agents tries to contact the
numbering \*\*\* PHONE. 1, and even though it is blocked by the client, to

our agent does not appear any warning, alarm or similar that indicates this
situation, therefore, calls continue to be issued.

       After receiving the last claim from the client, the operation has been strengthened at the
time to establish and prepare communication campaigns to clients, inhibiting
this number automatically so that it cannot be included as a recipient in

no case in those communications; and controls will be carried out periodically
in order to check that our agents comply with all the measures established by

the company".

THIRD: The result of the transfer process initiated in the previous event does not

allowed to understand satisfied the claims of the claimant. Consequently, with
dated April 21, 2021, for the purposes provided for in article 64.2 of the LOPDGDD,

The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to admit for processing the
claim filed.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                             II

        The defendant is charged with committing an offense for violation of the
Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the

      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;

      (…) "

       The offense is classified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/12

with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that

suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that one and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)

        a) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the

           conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
           Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                            III

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the

claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it processed the
Claimant's personal data without having any legitimacy to do so.

      The respondent has recognized this error and indicated that it has analyzed the
record of calls made by the claimant in this file, and

note that, after confirming the receipt of these, it has been detected that by mistake
included the claimant and their number in a campaign organized by the defendant

in order to verify the existence of technical failures that the
customers.

       Likewise, it states that after receiving the last claim from the client, it has
Strengthened operations when establishing and preparing campaigns for
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/12

communications to clients, inhibiting this number automatically so that no
can be included as a recipient in any case in these communications; So what

will carry out controls periodically in order to check that their agents
they comply with all the measures established by the company.

        Now, despite stating the claimed in previous claims
have implemented new security measures so that it does not happen again. This

of course, that the calls of 1002 and 1004, continue to occur. Therefore, it is
is producing the treatment of the claimant's personal data without basis
legitimizing.

                                            IV

      The determination of the sanction to be imposed in the present case requires

respectively, provide the following:

           "Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

         c) any measure taken by the person in charge or in charge of the treatment
         to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;

         d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or the person in charge of the

         treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
         applied by virtue of articles 25 and 32;

         e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
         treatment;

          f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to establish

         remedy the violation and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the violation;

         g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

         k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the

         case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct
         or indirectly, through the infringement. " (The underlining is from the AEPD)

        In order to specify the amount of the penalty to be imposed on the one claimed by

  violation of article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, it is essential to examine and assess whether
  the circumstances described in article 83.2 of the RGPD concur and if they intervene

  instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the fine to impose

  identification, the line identifier) (article 83.2 g).

       - Section k), in relation to article 76.2 of Organic Law 3/2018, which
         frames as aggravating the continuing nature of the offense attributed to the

         claimed.

         treatment of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2 K, of the
         RGPD in relation to article 76.2 b, of the LOPDGDD).

     That is why it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to impose on the claimed and
set it at the amount of € 75,000 for the violation of article 6 of the RGPD.
