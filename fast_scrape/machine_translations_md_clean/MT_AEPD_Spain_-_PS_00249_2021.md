## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) alleging that Vodafone had contracted with them services that they had not requested with their personal data, and that they had received an invoice for those services that they had not contracted. The AEPD launched an investigation.

### Holding

The AEPD discovered that a third person had contracted Vodafone's services using the data subject's personal data, since the data subject had an associated phone line at Vodafone that included the data of the third person. Vodafone had issued a invoice to the data subject for such phone line and other non-contracted services.

The AEPD deemed that Vodafone was responsible for these facts, since they did not have a system in place that allowed to verify the identity of the contracting person, so any person could use others' personal data to enter a contract with Vodafone.

This led to the situation that allowed a third person to use the data subject's personal data to enter the contract without their consent. Therefore, Vodafone was processing personal data of the data subject without a legal ground.

For this, the AEPD fined Vodafone €80,000, that were reduced to €64,000 for voluntary payment, for a violation of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").
