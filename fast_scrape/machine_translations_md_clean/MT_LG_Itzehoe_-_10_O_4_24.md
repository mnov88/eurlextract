## English Summary

### Facts

On 22 November 2019, a data subject entered into a mobile phone contract with the controller (a telecommunications company). The telecommunications company transmitted to 2 credit information agencies so called 'positive data' about the data subject, in particular information about the commissioning and execution of the contract which included data required to identify the respective person. The data subject received a leaflet regarding the transmission of data to S with a reference to a right of objection.

On 19 October 2023, one of the credit information agencies published a press release stating that it would delete customer account information relating to the constoller. This decision was due to following the assessment of the Data Protection Conference of the German States (DSK) and the body of the independent German federal and state data protection supervisory authorities that the transmission and processing of data from the telecommunications sector by credit information agencies for credit scoring cannot be based on a "legitimate interest" according to Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR and consent is required.

The data subject filed a case before the court of first instance (Regional Court of Itzehoe- LG Itzehoe) requesting that the controller is ordered to compensate them for immaterial damages for the data protection breach, cease and desist transmitting their personal data to the credit information agencies and compensate them for all future damages that the plaintiff has suffered and/or will suffer as a result of the unauthorized transmission. They claim that they did not consent to having their personal data shared with the credit information agencies and that the transmission is unlawful and violated Article 6(1) and [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"). They alleged it caused non-material damage in the form of loss of control over their data deriving from the transmission, impact on economic decisions and financial freedom, and suffering fear of data loss and sleep disorders due to their credit score.

The controller claimed that the transfer of the data was justified to protect legitimate interests such as prevention of fraud, the prevention of over-indebtedness and the facilitation of more precise default risk forecasts as well as the general interest in the functioning of the credit information agency.

### Holding

First, the court held that the registration of the data subject's positive data with credit information agencies was found to be lawful under the legitimate interests basis of [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). According to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data prevail.

The court considered that the processing served not only the controller’s economic interests but also the wider interest of data subjects in fraud prevention as registering the data could be considered protecting them from identity theft and other fraudulent offenses, which a reasonable consumer has a significant interest in. The court is of the opinion that only registering negative data such as payment defaults would not be sufficient to protect the controller's interests, as there is a particular risk for consumers that identity theft and fraud will only be discovered when significant financial damage has been caused. Furthermore, no less intrusive but equally effective means of fraud prevention were identified.

Second, it decided that the data subject is not entitled to compensation for non-material damages under [Article 82(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#1 "Article 82 GDPR") in conjunction with Articles 6(1) and 5(1)(a) GDPR. According to the court, it is irrelevant whether the data subject was aware of, or even consented to the registration of the positive data with the credit information agencies in the contract with the telecommunications company, since the registration of the positive data was lawful according to the balancing of interests required under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

Third, the court held that even if a data protection violation had occurred, the data subject failed to demonstrate any causal and compensable damage (either material or non-material) as required under [Article 82(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#1 "Article 82 GDPR") and as interpreted by the CJEU in cases [C-340/21](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C%E2%80%91340/21_-_Natsionalna_agentsia_za_prihodite "CJEU - C‑340/21 - Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite") and [C-300/21](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-306/21_-_Koalitsia_%E2%80%98Demokratichna_Bulgaria_%E2%80%93_Obedinenie%E2%80%99 "CJEU - C-306/21 - Koalitsia ‘Demokratichna Bulgaria – Obedinenie’"). Feelings of loss of control, concern about future misuse, or sleep disturbances were not deemed to amount to real and specific emotional harm.

Lastly, the court rejected the claims of the data subject.

The decision below is a machine translation of the German original. Please refer to the German original for more details.

```
Itzehoe Regional Court, 10th Civil Division, Judgment of
September 30, 2024, Case No. 10 O 4/24
The parties are disputing claims related to the transmission of positive data to the credit reporting agencies S. H. AG (hereinafter: S.) and C. GmbH (hereinafter: C.).
The defendant provides telecommunications services.
On November 22, 2019, the parties concluded a telecommunications contract with contract number...
For further details, reference is made to Exhibit B1A.
In the course of concluding the contract, the plaintiff took note of the defendant's information sheet on data protection. For further details, reference is made to the information sheet in Exhibit B1B.
After concluding the mobile phone contract with the plaintiff, the defendant reported so-called positive data to S., i.e., information about the commissioning and execution of the contract. Specifically, the defendant provided S. with the data necessary to identify the respective person, such as name, date of birth, and address, as well as the date of the contract conclusion, the contract number, and the date of the contract termination.
Furthermore, the defendant provided C. with the name, date of birth, address, email address, the first four and last two digits of an IBAN, and the corresponding bank sort code for a bank account belonging to the plaintiff. Furthermore, it provided the telecommunications provider's identifier in the form of a sequence of numbers. For further details, reference is made to the screenshot of the plaintiff's CRIF self-disclosure on page 122d of the file.
On October 19, 2023, S. published a press release under the headline "S. deletes data on telecommunications accounts." In the notification, S. stated October 20, 2023, as the start date of the deletion.
The press release states, among other things:
"Why the telecommunications company and S. have decided to take this step and what this could mean for you – here are the seven most important questions and answers:
1. What data is involved? This is the information that a telecommunications company has a contract account, i.e., a customer account, that entails a credit risk for the telecommunications company. Prepaid customer accounts do not carry a risk of default – consequently, they were not reported to S. Information on defaults will continue to be reported and processed as part of credit scores and reports.
3. What impact can deletion have on my score?
First of all: Our analyses prior to deletion have shown that, on average, scores change only marginally. For 53 percent of people, the score will be lower after deletion, and for 47 percent, it will be higher (the higher the better). We analyzed the impact on the bank score, the most frequently provided score by S. for credit decisions. Score.
...
7. Why is information about telecommunications contracts actually deleted? The reason for the deletion is the resolution of the Data Protection Conference of the German States (DSK), the body of the independent German federal and state data protection supervisory authorities. The DSK discussed the transmission and processing of so-called positive data from the telecommunications sector by credit reporting agencies and assessed it as follows: The transmission and processing of data from the telecommunications sector by credit reporting agencies for credit scoring cannot be based on a "legitimate interest" (according to Art. 6 (1) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); consent is required for this (according to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).
Following the resolution of the Data Protection Conference adopted in autumn 2021, no new contract data relating to customer accounts from telecommunications companies was transmitted to S. and processed by it. The open legal question of whether the positive data may be transferred to S. on the basis of the so-called legitimate interest is currently being clarified by the courts – although S. is not the defendant. A final judgment is currently pending. The decision to delete the data was made independently of this."
For details, please refer to the press release in Appendix B 2.
By letter dated December 12, 2023, the plaintiff's legal representatives requested the defendant to compensate for the damages incurred and to cease and desist. For details, please refer to the letter in Appendix K 1.
The plaintiff claims that it did not consent to the registration of the contract conclusion with S. and C.
The plaintiff believes that the defendant's transmission of its data to S. was unlawful and violated the provisions of the GDPR, in particular Article 6 (1) and Article 5 (1 a) GDPR. This caused it non-material damage, which the defendant must compensate. Furthermore, it is entitled to an injunction and a declaration of liability for future damages.
The plaintiff believes that the transmission of the positive data to the credit agencies already constitutes non-material damage. This deprives the plaintiff of control over its data. The plaintiff claims that the – in her opinion, unauthorized – disclosure of sensitive information negatively impacts the plaintiff's economic decisions and restricts her financial freedom.
She claims that she has developed a fear of data loss that accompanies her everyday life. She fears that, once data has been transmitted, data will be shared multiple times or repeatedly without the plaintiff's knowledge, or has already been shared. This leads to great uncertainty for the plaintiff. In particular, with regard to the plaintiff's possible negative development of the SCHUFA and CRIF scores, due to the lack of transparency of the calculation basis for these scores, there is uncertainty and considerable concern that obtaining loans and concluding a rental agreement will be impossible.
The plaintiff also claims that she has been suffering from sleep disorders since receiving her CRIF self-disclosure. Furthermore, she has suffered a loss of income at work since that time. For further details, please refer to the plaintiff's informational hearing on September 16, 2024 (see minutes of the oral hearing of September 16, 2024).
The plaintiff most recently requests, in a written submission dated September 5, 2024, that:
1. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff non-material damages as compensation for the data protection violation, the amount of which is left to the discretion of the court, but should not be less than EUR 5,000.00, plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the respective base interest rate of the ECB since December 27, 2023.
2. The defendant is ordered to refrain from transmitting positive data of the plaintiff within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation, i.e., personal data of the plaintiff that does not contain negative payment experiences or other non-contractual behavior, but rather represents information about the application, implementation, and termination of a contract, to credit agencies, in particular S. H. AG and C. GmbH, without the plaintiff's consent, and/or otherwise making such data available to credit agencies, in particular S. H. AG and C. GmbH.
3. It is determined that the defendant is obligated to compensate the plaintiff for all future damages that the plaintiff has incurred and/or will incur as a result of the unauthorized transmission of its positive data to the credit agencies S. H. AG and C. GmbH.
4. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff pre-trial legal fees in the amount of EUR 1,134.55 plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the respective ECB base interest rate from December 27, 2023.
The defendant requests that
the action be dismissed.
The plaintiff received a leaflet, among other things, regarding the transmission of data to S., with a reference to a right of objection in accordance with Appendix B2. The positive data stored by S. relating to the telecommunications contract in question have since been deleted. In the alternative, the defendant argues that there was no culpable violation. The transmission of the data is justified to protect legitimate interests. The transmission serves to prevent fraud, prevent over-indebtedness, enable more precise default risk forecasts, and serve the general interest in the functioning of credit agencies such as S. The plaintiff's interests in opposing the transmission of positive data do not prevail. The defendant is of the opinion that the injunctive relief is inadmissible due to a lack of sufficient specificity. Furthermore, there is no interest in establishing the facts.

The court has heard the plaintiff for information purposes. In this regard, reference is made to the minutes of the hearing dated September 16, 2024. The action was served on the defendant on March 16, 2024.

For further factual submissions, reference is made to the exchanged pleadings and attachments.

The action is admissible but unfounded.

I. The Itzehoe Regional Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Sections 23, Sentence 1, No. 1, and 71, Paragraph 1 of the German Court of Justice Act (GVG) and local jurisdiction pursuant to Section 17 of the German Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO).

The injunctive relief satisfies the requirements of Section 253 (2) No. 2 ZPO. An interest in a declaratory judgment pursuant to Section 256 ZPO has been sufficiently demonstrated.
The joinder of claims is permissible pursuant to Section 260 ZPO.
The amendment of the claim is permissible pursuant to Section 263 ZPO.
II. However, the action is unfounded.
The claim under point 1 is unfounded because the plaintiff is not entitled to compensation for (non-material) damages pursuant to Art. 82 (1) GDPR in conjunction with Art. 6 (1) and 5 (1 a) GDPR.
Pursuant to Art. 82 (1) GDPR, any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of a violation of the General Data Protection Regulation has a right to compensation for damages from the controller or processor. According to Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR, a controller within this meaning is any natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. the processing of personal data, including the defendant.
However, the requirements for a claim for damages under Article 82 (1) GDPR are not met, as there is no data protection violation by the defendant, and in any event, no causal compensable damage on the part of the plaintiff.
By registering the conclusion of the contract, the defendant did not violate Article 6 (1) or Article 5 (1) (a) GDPR.
It is irrelevant whether the plaintiff consented to the registration of the positive data with S. and C. in the contract with the defendant or whether they were aware of it through the data protection information sheet in Annex B1 A, since the registration of the positive data was lawful in any case according to the balancing of interests required under Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
According to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data prevail.
When examining legitimate interests, it must be taken into account that the defendant not only pursues its own economic interests by registering positive data, but also indirectly promotes the interests of consumers and thus ultimately also of the plaintiff itself through the data transmission. This is particularly true if the defendant registers the data to protect consumers from identity theft and other fraudulent offenses. A reasonable consumer clearly has a significant interest in ensuring that their data is not misused for criminal purposes and, in particular, that legal transactions are not illegally concluded in their name.
The court is of the opinion that the registration of negative data, in particular payment defaults, is not sufficient to protect these interests. If registrations are limited to negative data, there is a particular risk for consumers that identity theft and fraud will only be discovered when significant (financial) damage has been caused by the previously solvent consumer and numerous contracts concluded, which can only be remedied with great effort and considerable inconvenience for those affected.

These interests are counteracted – assuming the plaintiff's claim that the plaintiff did not consent to the registration is true – by, on the one hand, the interference with the plaintiff's right to informational self-determination. On the other hand, the registration interferes with the plaintiff's interest in freely deciding on new contracts. This is because:
As is particularly evident from the S. press release of October 19, 2023, even positive data generally has an impact on the SCHUFA score, which can also be negative, since the conclusion of any contract that obligates the consumer to make a financial payment is associated with the risk of payment default. However, for this risk to actually have a negative impact on the SCHUFA SCORE, further circumstances must be present, either cumulatively or alternatively:
The contract was concluded recently. The court is aware from parallel proceedings that a "young" business relationship tends to have a negative impact on the SCHUFA SCORE, as no reliable statements can yet be made regarding the likelihood of fulfillment of payment obligations. Conversely, however, longer contractual relationships, in turn, lead to an increase in the SCHUFA SCORE.
It also has a negative impact if multiple contracts of the same type exist, similar to credit card contracts.
However, the resulting interference with the freedom to conclude contracts is marginal when weighed against the aforementioned interests, particularly fraud prevention.
Firstly, the average consumer is unlikely to be interested in more than a maximum of two cell phone contracts and one internet contract (Wi-Fi for home).
On the other hand, constant changes of provider due to price reductions are likely to have only a marginal impact on the SCHUFA SCORE, as this represents only a comparatively small portion of the data reported to S. Many other data, in particular bank details, payment default data, credit inquiries, etc., are included in the SCHUFA SCORE, which provide a significantly more meaningful picture of the consumer's ability to pay than the data on the conclusion of telecommunications contracts. The same is likely to apply to C.
A less burdensome but equally effective means of achieving the purpose of fraud prevention than the transmission of contract data to the credit agencies has neither been presented nor otherwise apparent.
Even assuming a data protection violation by the defendant, the plaintiff has in any case failed to prove causal damage.
The plaintiff has not demonstrated causal material damage. This is not changed by the plaintiff's statement at its briefing hearing, according to which it was denied a personal loan in January 2024, citing the credit provider's poor SCHUFA score of the plaintiff. A causal connection between the defendant's registration in question and the disputed positive data is already ruled out, since the disputed positive data had likely already been deleted by S. at that time, according to its undisputed press release. Furthermore, since the plaintiff did not submit a SCHUFA self-disclosure, it cannot be ruled out that other SCHUFA entries were not the primary cause of the plaintiff's poor SCHUFA score. The plaintiff did not submit a SCHUFA report.
The plaintiff also failed to prove causal non-pecuniary damage.
In view of Recitals 75, 85, 146, and 148 of the GDPR, the regulator considered non-material damage to include discrimination, identity theft, identity fraud, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data subject to professional secrecy, or social disadvantages, without excluding minor damage. However, with regard to possible future misuse of personal data, non-material damage can only be established if it involves real and certain emotional harm and not merely a nuisance or inconvenience (cf. ECJ, Opinion of April 27, 2023 – C-340/21; Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court GRUR-RS 2023, 4182). In any case, a possible violation – regardless of the question of significance – does not per se lead to damage (ECJ judgment of May 4, 2023, C-300/21). Specific damage must be determined in each individual case (Bonn Regional Court, judgment of May 10, 2023, case no. 3 O 201/22). However, actual damage in the sense of physical or psychological impairment (cf. Opinion of Advocate General Giovanni Pitruzella of April 27, 2022, C-340/21, para. 83) is precisely not present in the present case.
The assertion that immediately after receiving the CRIF notification, a feeling of loss of control and great concern, particularly with regard to one's own creditworthiness, arose, characterized by the fear of being exposed to unauthorized disclosure to a credit agency and possibly further unauthorized disclosures, and that this continues to worry the plaintiff to this day, was clearly made without sufficient factual basis.
Following the formulaic pleadings, the plaintiff's submissions during its informal hearing at the hearing failed to convince the court that damage within the meaning of Art. 82 GDPR had occurred as a result of the registration. The plaintiff did not argue in its personal hearing that the defendant's registration prevented the plaintiff from entering into contractual relationships for fear of possible consequences.
Furthermore, it is not credible that the plaintiff, who undisputedly took note of the data protection information sheet in Annex B 1 B, which provided for the transfer of data to credit agencies, suddenly suffered a feeling of loss of control four years later, after discovering that this transfer had actually occurred.
Even assuming this delayed onset of the feeling of loss of control is true, and further assuming that the registration was unlawful, the registration would in any case only be a contributory cause of the feeling of loss of control that the plaintiff claims as damage here. However, this contributory causation would be offset by the plaintiff's contributory negligence under Section 254 of the German Civil Code (BGB), meaning that even then the plaintiff would not be entitled to any damages. This is because the plaintiff's feeling of loss of control – this was the impression the court gained, particularly during the oral hearing – stems primarily from the plaintiff's self-inflicted ignorance.
Thus, the plaintiff could only rudimentarily identify which data had actually been reported to C. Despite having read the information sheet, the plaintiff apparently no longer remembered that the data might also have been reported to S. by the time of the oral hearing. Furthermore, the court also became aware during the oral hearing that the plaintiff was also unaware of the basic working methods and functioning of the credit agencies. The alleged feeling of loss of control was triggered in the plaintiff by the fact that she learned about the registration of the positive data via the Internet and then did not inform herself about what these registrations were all about, how credit agencies work and what rights of information she is entitled to against the credit agencies under the GDPR.
The court also finds the plaintiff's argument that she is suffering revenue losses at work because, as a sales representative for E.ON, she falls into a state of "shock" when informing customers about data protection regulations incomprehensible.
The plaintiff has not been able to explain in a comprehensible manner why she falls into this state of shock at work. The court understood the plaintiff's argument on this point to mean that this state of shock always occurs when the plaintiff has E.ON customers sign the data protection notices upon conclusion of the contract, because she, i.e., the plaintiff, must then always be mindful that the customer could then suffer the same alleged loss of control as she did. However, this argument contradicts the plaintiff's claim to have received appropriate training regarding data protection in order to be able to inform the respective customers about the data protection regulations. Assuming such training is true, it is incomprehensible why the plaintiff is concerned about individual customers, since the plaintiff should then be able to inform the customer in such a way that a loss of control does not occur later, but rather to transparently explain to the customer the transfer of data to credit agencies, if such transfer is planned.
The court gained the impression that the plaintiff's described "shock" is ultimately also due to the fact that the plaintiff, although aware that their data had been transferred, did not consider what the data actually was and how C. processed it, or to what extent the processing could affect the plaintiff.
The sleep disturbances, which are already disputed between the parties and which the plaintiff claims to be suffering as a result of the alleged loss of control, are also not compensable for the reasons stated above.
The admissible claim under item 2 is in any case unfounded, since, in the absence of a data protection violation, there is also no claim for injunctive relief.
The admissible claim under item 3, seeking a declaratory judgment, is also unfounded because it is not apparent that the disputed transmission of positive data to S. and C. could cause damage to the plaintiff. The fact that a single mobile phone contract was concluded is – as the court knows from parallel proceedings – insufficient to reduce the plaintiff's creditworthiness. For example, plaintiffs in parallel proceedings with only one entry, namely a mobile phone contract of a similar age in 2023, consistently had good to very good SCHUFA SCORE values. The occurrence of future damage is all the more unlikely given that the ECJ clarified in its decision of December 7, 2023 (ECJ (First Chamber) Judgment of December 7, 2023 – C-634/21 (OQ v Land Hessen) (NZA 2024, 45, beck-online) that banks, in particular, may not reject a credit inquiry fully automatically and solely based on the credit agency score. This case law is likely to be applicable to other companies that conduct credit inquiries.
The ancillary claim shares the fate of the principal debt.
The procedural ancillary decisions follow from Section 91 (1) Sentence 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) and Section 709 Sentence 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO).
