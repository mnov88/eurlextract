By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD grants to each supervisory authority, and in accordance with the provisions of articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure. With the above-mentioned conduct of the defendant, the power of investigation that Article 58.1 of the RGPD confers on the supervisory authorities, in this case the AEPD, has been obstructed. Therefore, the proven facts are considered to constitute an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of Article 58. 1 of the RGPD, which provides that each supervisory authority shall have, among its powers of investigation: "(a) to order the controller and the processor, and where appropriate the representative of the controller or processor, to supply any information which the controller or processor may require for the performance of his duties; (b) to conduct inquiries in the form of data protection audits; (c) to carry out a review of the certificates issued pursuant to Article 42(7); (d) to notify the controller or processor of alleged infringements of this Regulation; (e) to obtain from the controller and the processor access to all personal data and to all information necessary for the performance of their duties ” IIIThis infringement is defined in Article 83.5(e) of the RGPD, which considers the following to be comotal: "failure to provide access in breach of Article 58(1)". In the same article it is established that this infringement can be sanctioned with a fine of twenty million euros (20,000,000 euros) as a maximum or, in the case of a company, of an amount equivalent to four percent (4%) as a maximum of the total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the higher amount.C/ Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es

(o) Resistance to or obstruction of the exercise of the inspection function by the competent data protection authority.

The complaint refers to the particular case of a person, but the processing of data to which it refers may potentially affect a very large number of customers of the entity responsible or users of the service provided by the entity responsible.
