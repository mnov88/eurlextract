## English Summary

### Facts

The Dutch DPA ('AP') received a notification on 11 January 2019 that CP&A processes the health data of its employees. From this notification, the AP concluded that CP&A maintained an online register, containing data on the cause of absenteeism in its employees. In response, it launched an own volition investigation into CP&A's compliance with Article 9, as well as Article 32 GDPR. Since Article 9 GDPR prohibits the processing of special categories of data, including health data, it was necessary for the AP to determine whether one of the exceptions outlined in Article 9 applies. The AP also sought to determine whether whether CP&A had taken sufficient technical and organisational measures to ensure a risk-appropriate level of security for the health data under Article 32 GDPR.

### Holding

The AP's investigation found that the relevant online register included employees' names, addresses, email addresses and social security number, which made employees directly identifiable. The register also included employees' reasons for absence (concerning both physical and mental health), including the names of illnesses, specific symptoms, and indications of pain. This constituted health data within the meaning of Article 4(15) GDPR. By digitally storing, updating, and making this data available, CP&A was processing health data.

The AP considered whether CP&A could process health data in line with the exception established by Article 9(2)(b), whereby processing is necessary for the carrying out of the controllers rights or obligations in the field of employment, so far as this is authorised by Union or member state law. In the Netherlands, Article 30(1) of the UAVG stipulates that the processing of personal data concerning health is permitted if this is necessary for the reintegration or guidance of employees in connection with illness or disability. With respect to this reintegration, further details are provided in the Section 658a(2) of the Dutch Civil Code, which requires employees to take the necessary measures to enable a sick employee to perform their work as soon as possible.

The AP found that the processing of the names of illnesses, specific symptoms, and indications of pain is not necessary for the reintegration of employees, in accordance with Article 30(1) UAVG, meaning it could not invoke the exception established at Article 9(2)(b) GDPR. Since no other exceptions were applicable, CP&A's processing of the health data was considered unlawful.

With regards to Article 32 GDPR, the AP found that CP&A's security measures concerning the online register were inappropriate. In particular, the register was accessible without any form of authentication. Given the sensitive nature of the data, the fact that the health data was processed on the internet, the CP&A should have taken further measures to mitigate the risk of unauthorised access to the data.

On account of the violations of Articles 9 and 32 GDPR, the DPA imposed a fine of €15,000.
