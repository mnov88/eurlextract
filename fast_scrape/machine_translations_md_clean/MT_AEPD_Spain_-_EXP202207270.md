## English Summary

### Facts

A construction company, the first controller, carried out work in the warehouse of the data subject. In order to show the results of its work, the first controller uploaded on its website photographs published on another ocmpany's, the second controller, website, which portrayed the construction site. In one of the photographs, the data subject was sitting behind a glass door with coloured squares partially covering their face and body. The photo was published by the first controller without the data subject's consent.

Subsequently, the data subject requested access to their data from the first controller. However, since they did not receive a response, the data subject submitted a complaint to the Spanish DPA. The first controller claimed that the photograph tried to show the result of the works of construction carried out in a building owned by the data subject. To do so, it re-used the photos from the second controller's website, with its consent. Accordingly, it was the second controller who should have asked the data subject for consent before further processing.

The Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding against the second controller who claimed that the publication of that photo did not involve processing of personal data and that they had not authorised the use of that photograph nor communicated any personal data belonging to the data subject to the first controller.

### Holding

First, the DPA recalled that according to [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR") the image of a person constitutes personal data because it reflects distinctive features, such as height or style, that help the association with a concrete individual. Moreover, a photo can inform about the age, gender or ethnicity, making the identification of a person easier. The DPA referred to [Article 4(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR") which defines the concept of processing. Publishing a person's image on websites must be regarded as processing of personal data.

Second, it was noted that the photograph did not portray the data subject entirely. With regards to this, national case law ([Judgement of the Supreme Court of 12 July 2004, 1702/2000](https://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder-Judicial/Tribunal-Supremo/)) interpreted that a photo of someone whose face is not visible but could still be identified by their contour may lead to a breach of their fundamental right to privacy.

Finally, since the photos were removed from the website as a result of another proceeding involving the controller, the Spanish DPA recalled [Article 19 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_19_GDPR "Article 19 GDPR"), which sets out the obligation to notify the rectification or erasure of personal data to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed. In this case, the second controller had deleted the data in the course of the proceedings but did not inform the first controller, as a recipient of the photo, about the erasure.

Having analysed the case, the Spanish DPA dismissed the complaint against the second controller as there was not enough evidence of the first controller communicating to the second controller the publication of the photographs on its website. However, the DPA noted ex officio that the second controller acted in violation of [Article 19 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_19_GDPR "Article 19 GDPR") by not informing the recipients that the photo had been deleted.

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Re-
General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each authori-

control and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The formal procedures
ted by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulatory provisions
dictated in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a sub-
sidiario, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

                            The image as personal data

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/8

The image of a person, in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD, is personal data.
make it identifiable, and its protection, therefore, is the subject of said RGPD:

       “«personal data»: any information about an identified natural person or
identifiable ("the interested party"); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person
whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by
an identifier, such as a name, an identification number,
location, an online identifier or one or more elements of the identity
physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person;”

The image is a personal and individual attribute of each physical person that is
defined by their height, complexion, way of sitting, dressing. Endowed with distinctive features
unique and singular elements that individualize it directly, associating it with an in-
concrete individual, being able to know, through it, the age, the sex, the color of the

skin, their way of being by the way they sit... which facilitates the identification of the in-
divide

For this reason, report 139/2017 of the Legal Office of this Agency states that "the
image, just as the voice of a person is a personal data, just as it will be any-
any information that allows to determine, directly or indirectly, their identity (...)”

Article 4.2 of the RGPD defines "treatment" as: "any operation or set
of operations carried out on personal data or sets of personal data,
whether by automated procedures or not, such as the collection, registration, organization
tion, structuring, conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation,

use, communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form of authorization
tion of access, collation or interconnection, limitation, suppression or destruction.”

The inclusion of the image of a person in web pages, forums, publications, which
identifies or makes a person identifiable, supposes a treatment of personal data-

them and, therefore, the person in charge of the treatment that carries out the same is obliged to
comply with the obligations that for the data controller are provided in the
RGPD and in the LOPDGDD.

                                            III
                            Right to data protection

This proceeding is initiated because the respondent party published, on its website
website the image of the complaining party, presumably authorizing the entity
SERVICES AND INTERVENTIONS IN BUILDING OF MEDITERRÁNEO, S.L., to
its use The image does not allow to see the person completely, but it is seen in

part. This, together with the fact that it appears linked to the embroidered part, where
lowered, which is additional information, make that person identifiable. All this,
constitutes a treatment of personal data of the complaining party.

Individuals have the power to dispose of their personal data, including

its image, as well as its dissemination, resulting, without a doubt, worthy of
protection of the person whose personal data is disseminated in violation of the legal
legal.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/8

Thus, the STC 292/2000, of November 30, provides that "the content of the fundamental right
fundamental to data protection consists of a power of disposition and social control
on the personal data that empowers the person to decide which of these data

provide to a third party, be it the State or an individual, or what this third party can
collect, and that also allows the individual to know who owns that personal data
and for what, being able to oppose that possession or use. These powers of disposal and
control over personal data, which constitute part of the content of the right
fundamental to data protection are legally specified in the power to con-
feel the collection, obtaining and access to personal data, its subsequent storage

storage and treatment, as well as its possible use or uses, by a third party, be it the Es-
ted or an individual. And that right to consent to knowledge and treatment, informed
matic or not, of personal data, requires as essential complements,
On the one hand, the ability to know at all times who has these personal data.
and to what use it is subjecting them, and, on the other hand, the power to oppose that possession

sion and uses”.

The Judgment of the Supreme Court, Civil Chamber, dated July 12, 2004, no.
resource number 1702/200, indicates the following in relation to the image:

       << The judgment under appeal bases its acquittal on not being identical

           Obligation to communicate the deletion of data to other entities

The RGPD establishes an obligation related to the right of suppression in its ar-
article 19, which indicates the following:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/8

       “Obligation of notification regarding the rectification or deletion of personal data
or the limitation of the treatment

       “The person responsible for the treatment will communicate any rectification or deletion
of personal data or limitation of the treatment carried out in accordance with article 16, to the
article 17, paragraph 1, and article 18 to each of the recipients to whom
have communicated the personal data, unless it is impossible or requires an effort
disproportionate. The person in charge will inform the interested party about said recipients.

rivers, if he so requests.”

In accordance with the evidence provided to the present procedure and those collected
tions of prior Rights procedures (deletion of images of the re-
claimed on the web pages of the claimed party), it has not been possible to prove that the

claimed party provided to SERVICES AND INTERVENTIONS IN BUILDING
DEL MEDITERRANEO, S.L., the images of the complaining party object of dispute
sia nor that he consented to its publication.

Given that it has not been proven that the defendant communicated the data of the party,
the claimant to the entity SERVICES AND INTERVENTIONS IN BUILDING OF THE

MEDITERRANEO, S.L., the infraction of what is established in the art-
article 19 of the RGPD.

                                      conclusion

concrete and determined, which obliges in any case to resolve said doubt in the most
favorable to the interested party.

The presumption of innocence must govern without exceptions in the sanctioning system.
and must be respected in the imposition of any sanctions, since the exerciser
ius puniendi in its various manifestations is conditioned to the game of

evidence and a contradictory procedure in which they can defend their own
positions. In this sense, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment 76/1990, of
26/04, considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails: “that the sanction
tion is based on acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the con-
reproached conduct; that the burden of proof corresponds to the one who accuses, without anyone

is obliged to prove his own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the result
of the tests carried out, freely assessed by the sanctioning body, must
translate into an acquittal pronouncement.”

The presumption of innocence governs without exceptions in the sanctioning system and has

to be respected in the imposition of any sanction, whether criminal or administrative
(TCo 13/1981), since the exercise of the sanctioning right in any of its manifestations

no sanction may be imposed by reason of the defendant's guilt if there is no
an activity to prove the charge, which, in the appreciation of the authorities or bodies

called to resolve, destroy this presumption (TCo Auto 3-12-81).

Based on the foregoing, it has not been proven that the respondent party provided the
images of the claimant party to the entity SERVICES AND INTERVENTIONS IN
BUILDING OF THE MEDITERRANEAN, S.L. The latter indicated that the party claimed

knew its use, but does not credit the means or the way in which it was done, reason
that is considered sufficient to propose the File of the present procedure, since
