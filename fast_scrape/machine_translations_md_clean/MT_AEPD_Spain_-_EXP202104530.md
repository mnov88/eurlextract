### Facts

A.A.A. (data subject) received a commercial SMS from BOOKSY INTERNATIONAL SPOLKA, S.L. (the assumed controller) to their mobile number without being customer nor consent.

On 15 March 2022, the DPA initiated a disciplinary proceeding against the controller for the alleged infringement of Article 21 LSSI, as defined in Article 38(4)(d) LSSI. The controller reacted to the allegations with a written statement, saying that they are a service provider to beauty establishments, like SHEILA NAILS (controller) offering them platform to promote their services.
