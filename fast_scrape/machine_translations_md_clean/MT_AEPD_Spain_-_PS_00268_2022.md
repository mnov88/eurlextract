## English Summary

### Facts

A consumer association (FACUA) submitted a complaint against the Regional Ministry of Health (Madrid Public Health Service), the controller, due to a defective appointment system put in place on the controller’s website which allowed citizens to request the Covid-19 vaccine.

The website was affected by a security breach. Furthermore, it had insufficient blocking mechanisms in cases of multiple authentication login attempts and the controller did not communicate the incident to the DPA.

The Spanish DPA requested the controller to provide detailed information regarding facts of the incident and security measures adopted prior to the security breach. The controller claimed that the launch of the system responded the urgency of the population’s vaccination in May and June 2021, a critical moment for the management of the pandemic. The controller fixed the system after having become aware of the breach. It improved and updated the system as well as implemented security measures, such as the reduction of information to be exchanged between the user’s browser and the server (by eliminating the phone number and gender), two-step authentification system, and that the security measures implemented on the controller’s IT applications were according to the Madrid Autonomous Community’s standards.

### Holding

Regarding [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR"), the DPA stated that personal data contained in the controller’s database were unlawfully exposed to third parties. The DPA referred to the national data protection law, LOPDGDD, whose [Articles 72](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673) and [73](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673) provide a list of violations considered "serious" and "very serious". According to [Article 72.1 LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673), the violation of data processing principles under [Article 5 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") was considered very serious.

Considering [Article 25(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#1 "Article 25 GDPR"), the DPA held that the application of appropriate technical and organisational measures was not achieved due to the described system’s failure. Considering the national legislation, [Article 73.1(d) LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673), this violation was considered a serious violation.

Moreover, according to the DPA, at the time of the data breach occurrence, the controller did not have appropriate technical and organisational measures to avoid the incident since the system did not have two-step authentication nor did the personal data appear pseudonymised, which resulted in the violation of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). This was considered a serious violation under national law, [Article 73.1(f) LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673).

In addition, the controller did not notify the data breach within the time limit which implied a violation of [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"), also considered a serious violation under the national law, [Article 73.1(f) LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673).

Finally, the Spanish DPA explained that [Articles 25(1)](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR "Article 25 GDPR") and [32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") highlight the need for the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures according to the risk when deciding both on the purposes and means at the moment of the processing itself. It is supposed to ensure an effective application of the data protection principles as well as adequate security level for that risk. In the present case, the urgency due to a sanitary emergency could not be accepted as an exemption since the launch of a defective application, which exposed personal data on a large scale, could cause even greater damage.

In conlusion, the Spanish DPA reprimanded the controller for the afore-discussed violations as [Article 77 LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673) foresees that the DPA can only reprimand but not fine public administration bodies.

reveal the following:

Regarding the causes that made the incident possible:
- After analyzing the facts, they conclude that the failure detected related to this
    information system is due to an exposure of data information

    personal (public) accessed through a valid session cookie, and editing
    the URL accessed one of the input fields called "idPatient" with a DNI
    valid. In this way, a series of personal data can be displayed
    corresponding to the person with the DNI used. Additionally, it is found that
    the web application had insufficient blocking mechanisms before

    retries when entering the authentication data (Code of
    Autonomous Population Identification \[CIPA\], Date of birth and DNI) for
    request the appointment.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/23

Regarding the affected data

- There is no record in the Ministry of Health that the failure occurred has
    affected any citizen, beyond the information published in the media
    Communication. Likewise, there is no evidence that there has been
    any damage to the freedoms and rights of citizens.

- Only identification data of the users could have been affected.
    citizens: Name and Surname, CIPA, Date of birth, Patient ID, DNI,
    Phone number, Gender.

- There is no record in the Ministry of Health that there has been a
    damage to the freedoms and rights of citizens, without any evidence of
    until the date that material or immaterial damage has been derived in the
    citizens who may have been affected. The correction of this

    vulnerability was prior to its dissemination in the media.
Detailed description of the actions taken to solve the incident and minimize
its impact on affected people:

- The application was modified in order to improve the
    information system and the version was uploaded, being the following
    the most relative changes:

    June 9th:

     Minimize the information to be exchanged between the user's browser and
    the server. Only information that is displayed on the screen or that the
    user has previously entered. No number is exchanged in any case
    telephone, CIP SNS (Population Identification Code of the National System of

    Health), sex. The rest (date of birth, name and surname), are shown by
    screen.

     Request the verification code sent by SMS as a first step, nothing more
    enter the identification data.
     Do not return specific error codes, only generic ones.

    The data required in the identification process is increased, offering two
    possibilities to the user:

               o CIPA + Date of birth + DNI

               o DNI/NIE/PASSPORT + Date of birth + First surname
- The design of the application architecture does not allow the modification of the data

    of user affiliation. Because the application makes use of a database
    independent and the requested mobile is only used as part of the OTP
    implemented to validate the appointment request.

Regarding security measures
- The SERMAS development team uses a development methodology

    continuously updated collected in (...) in the Ministry of Health of the
    Madrid's community.

    They provide a copy of (...), whose objective is to have the standards that must be
    fulfill the applications from the technical and functional point of view, as well as the
    whitepapers describing the platforms with which they should be integrated
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/23

    the same. The indications and guidelines (...) are mandatory for
    all the development of new applications for the DGSIS.

- The point (...) establishes with respect to the access to the applications of the citizens what
    Next:

    (…)

- Manifest in relation to the impact assessment (EIPD) on the present
    treatment, taking into account its nature, scope, context and purposes, as well as

    that in the present treatment there is no systematic evaluation and
    exhaustive of personal aspects that is based on automated processing,
    nor is there a treatment of special categories of data. Therefore, it
    considers that in the present treatment it is not necessary to carry out a
    EIPD.

5.- It has been verified by data inspection that the Internet Archive (library
managed by a non-profit organization containing millions of

Internet pages recorded since 1996) has registered the web page
https://autocitavacuna.sanidadmadrid.org existing on June 14, 2021,
in which it can be verified that to request an appointment for the vaccine, it is requested
only the CIPA code and in case of not having said code, a DNI is requested and
Date of Birth.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/23

CONCLUSIONS

- Regarding the causes that have made possible the incident published in
    ElDiario.es, the representative of the Ministry states that, after analyzing the
    facts conclude that the failure detected related to this system of
    information is due to an exposure of personal data information
    (public) accessed via a valid session cookie, and editing the URL
    accessed one of the input fields called "idPatient" with a valid DNI.

    This explanation is inconsistent with the security incident reported to this
    Agency by FACUA, incident in which personal data was left
    exposed when making an appointment request with a CIPA number (Code of
    Personal Identification of the Community of Madrid) existing. It has been proven
    for the inspection of data that the Internet Archive maintains the website
    https://autocitavacuna.sanidadmadrid.org existing on the date of June 14,

    2021, in which it can be verified that to request an appointment for the vaccine,
    only requests the CIPA code and in case of not having said code,
    request ID and date of birth.

    On the other hand, the representative of the Ministry recognizes that, among the actions
    taken to solve the incident, the information has been reduced to a minimum.
    exchange between the user's browser and the server. only broadcast
    information that is displayed on the screen or that the user has entered
    previously. Telephone number is not exchanged in any case, CIP SNS
    (Population Identification Code of the National Health System), sex. The

    rest (date of birth, name and surname), are displayed on the screen. Also,
    The data required in the identification process has been increased, offering
    two possibilities for the user: CIPA + Date of birth + DNI or
    DNI/NIE/PASSPORT + Date of birth + First surname.

- Regarding security measures, the Madrid Health Service (SERMAS)

    dependent on the Ministry, uses a methodology for the development of
    computer applications that is collected in (...) of the Community of Madrid.

FIFTH: On July 15, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimed party,

for the alleged infringement of Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, Article 33 of the RGPD, Article
25 of the RGPD and Article 32 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD.

Once the Start Agreement was notified, the MINISTRY presented a brief of allegations in the
which in summary stated:

-That in the months of May and June 2021, we were at a very
critical related to the management of the pandemic. In this period, when the
vaccination process for the general population - albeit in a staggered manner
age groups-, the organization and opening of said
process massively and, consequently, it was necessary to offer a

system with clear and simple information on the process to be followed by the
citizenship and the urgency required for its adoption at the organizational level, including
also several channels to facilitate citizen citations.
This state of health emergency made it necessary to develop a
large number of new tools with great speed to be able to provide the best

service to citizens by developing and deploying the citation process
for vaccination in an agile way in authorized centers, even allowing the
citizen to select the time and center of his preference, which facilitated the
Community of Madrid reached a high number of vaccinated population,
contributing with said action to be able to face this situation of

pandemic as soon as possible, and facilitate the mobility of the population before the start of
periods traditionally considered as vacations in which there would be
the mobility of the population.

       -In this regard, this Agency recalls that both article 25.1 of the RGPD
       as 32 of the same legal text, stress the need that, both in the

       time of determining the means of treatment as well as at the time of
       treatment itself, the controller adopts technical and organizational measures
       appropriate to effectively apply the principles of data protection
       and guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, without being able to accept
       as excuse the circumstance of urgency alleged by health emergency.

       It is not possible to appreciate, in the present case, a state of necessity that justifies the
       put into production of a faulty application, which allowed access to
       personal data of a large number of citizens, without making
       previously the necessary checks to determine its correct
       operation, and whose use can cause greater harm than that which is

       intends to avoid.

-That in the initial agreement reference is made in the section “Regarding the
security measures” to the point (…), which is generic, and which for Self-citation is
enabled other access procedures so that citizens who do not
had a Health Card of the Community of Madrid, they could request the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/23

vaccination through the website. They consider, therefore, that the reference (...)
should be deleted as it bears no relation to this particular case.

       -In this regard, this Agency has simply reflected the information
       provided by the MINISTRY itself in its response to the request for
       information made by the AEPD, in which they attach a (...) to which they make
       reference in paragraph 6 of your answer:

       “6. Security measures of personal data processing adopted

       prior to the incident, as well as supporting documentation of the
       Risk Analysis that has led to the implementation of said safety measures
       security and, if applicable, a copy of the Impact Assessments of the
       treatments where the data security violation has occurred
       personal”.

       And that, according to the MINISTRY itself, is the development methodology
       used.

-That measures have been established for the continuous improvement of crisis management and
cyber incidents, focused on the prevention, detection and response to incidents of

security. Specifically, the following measures have been implemented to
strengthen security:

• The process of development and start-up of applications has been reviewed, such as
part of the continuous improvement process in the development and commissioning cycle of

applications, with special emphasis on the following aspects:

       o Reinforcement of the resources allocated to the prior validation of the security of the
       application before going into production.
       o Reinforcement of penetration testing and analysis methods

       code to all self-developed systems and will not be put into production
       even with solving the possible vulnerabilities detected.
       o Reassessment of all self-developed systems to verify that they
       the vulnerabilities with High or Critical typology have been corrected,
       detected during the “pentest” phase.

• The (...) has been reviewed, updating the main areas to take into account when
of developing applications, as well as the main tasks tasks to consider
when implementing applications in the Continuous Integration structure and
Continuous Deployment in the CSCM, in order to have the highest standards
that the applications must comply with from the technical point of view and

functional, as well as the technical documents that describe the platforms with which
which must be integrated.

• Use cases in security audits have been improved.

Lastly, it is relevant to mention that work is currently being done on a
project to adopt a tool (...).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/23

       -In this regard, this Agency values positively the adoption of new
       measures that result in greater security in terms of the treatment of
       personal data refers and that can prevent, in the future, incidents

       such as the one substantiated in this proceeding.

-That the (...) is part of the security regulatory body of the CSCM and is
is qualified as a RESTRICTED USE document, so it is
considered a controlled release document and its use is restricted to personnel
organization, since its public dissemination may pose a risk

for security. The content (...) constitutes confidential information whose dissemination,
outside the organization or the scope of the people who do not need to know said
information, it can cause damage or cyberattacks on the
services considered essential by law.
Therefore, it is required that such information, given its extraordinary sensitivity, be

object of reservation and, consequently, that information about the content is not displayed
(...) in the Resolution that falls on this procedure and that could, in its
case, be published.

       -In this regard, this Agency states that the documentation contained in the
       file is used exclusively to carry out an exhaustive and correct

       instruction of the same, not being, in any case, of public access. Even
       in the event that in the resolution that falls some type of
       information of restricted use, it would be anonymized as a step
       prior to publication.

SIXTH: On August 12, 2022, a resolution proposal was formulated,
proposing that the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency
sanction the MINISTRY OF HEALTH, with NIF S7800001E,

-Due to an infringement of Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the
GDPR, with a warning.

competent control in accordance with Article 55 without undue delay and, if
possible, no later than 72 hours after you have been aware of it, to

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                           Yo
In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each

control authority and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The procedures

processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

                                           II
In relation to the arguments presented to the resolution proposal, the
MINISTRY reiterates those already presented above and adds that:

1-Regarding the notification of the breach to the AEPD, depending on the level of risk

of the incidence, taking into account the low volume of data that could have been
affected, the typology of the same, being only data of a
identification, and the non-existent impact caused on the interested parties, it was estimated that
it was mandatory to inform the Control Authority.

In the present case, taking into account that, neither at that time, nor currently,

there is evidence that no citizen has suffered negative consequences in
their rights and freedoms, taking into account additionally that they have not been

risk to the rights and freedoms of citizens.

       -In this regard, this Agency indicates that it has not been submitted by the
       COUNSELING an assessment of risks actually carried out, resulting, by
       Therefore, very indeterminate the concept of: "it was unlikely that it would be constituted

       a risk to the rights and freedoms of citizens”

2- Security measures initially taken. In addition to the above, as indicated
In the initial communication to the AEPD, from the design the tool had

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/23

adequate security measures to avoid, so much so that the impact of possible
security incidents were high, as they happened.

       -In this regard, this Agency confirms that, in fact, the incidents
       materialized, that a fault was detected in the system, due to a
       exposure of personal (public) data information accessed through
       a valid session cookie, and editing the URL accessed one of the fields
       entry called "idPatient" with a valid DNI.
       Additionally, it was found that the web application had mechanisms for

       Insufficient blocking before retries when entering the data of
       authentication.

                                            III
