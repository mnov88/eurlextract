## English Summary

### Facts

A STIB user was fined because he did not validate his ticket before entering the bus, although he had a valid transportation ticket. He was sued by the STIB before the local judge (Juge de paix).

### Dispute

Is the processing of data of the users compliant with the GDPRÂ ?

### Holding

The judge considered that the processing of the data of the users including the data on their journeys, even if stored in two separate databases, was not in line with the GDPR, because the explicit purposes were not determined in advance, and because the legal basis for doing so was not clear. As a consequence, the judge decided that the fine should not be paid.
