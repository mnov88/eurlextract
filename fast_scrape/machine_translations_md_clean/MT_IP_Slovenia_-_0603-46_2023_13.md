## English Summary

### Facts

The Slovenian DPA carried out an investigation in the premises of a controller, following a complaint regarding their use of video surveillance and the lack of adequate notice for its use.

The controller had their premises under video surveillance. The video surveillance presented an information notice. However, this notice was not placed in a way that would allow for an individual to be informed about the surveillance before entering the premises and to decide whether they wanted to be in the area covered by the video surveillance.

### Holding

The Slovenian DPA held that the controller had failed to comply with its duty to ensure that data subjects were notified of the controller's use of video surveillance. As such, the controller had violated [Article 76(3) ZVOP-2](http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959).

The controller had displayed an information notice for their use of video surveillance. However, this notice was not placed in a way that would allow for an individual to be informed about the surveillance before entering the premises and to decide whether they wanted to be in the area covered by the video surveillance.

The DPA found the placement of the notice to breach of [Article 76(3) ZVOP-2](http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959). As a result, the DPA held the controller liable on the basis of [Article 100(3) ZVOP-2](http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959) in conjunction with [Article 100(1)(2) ZVOP-2](http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959), and issued a reprimand.

## Comment

ZVOP-2 is Slovenia's national implementation of the GDPR.

[Article 76(3) ZVOP-2](http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959) states that a controller must ensure that a video surveillance notice includes the information required by [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). It further requires a written or unambiguous graphic description of the fact that video surveillance is being carried out, the purposes of the processing, the name of the controller of the video surveillance system, a telephone number or an e-mail address or a website address to exercise the data subject's rights in the field of the protection of personal data, information on the specific impact of the processing, in particular further processing, the contact details of the authorized person (telephone number or e-mail address) and information about unusual further processing, such as transfers to third country entities, live monitoring and the possibility of audio intervention in case of live monitoring.
