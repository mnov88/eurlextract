## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that he registered to a job fair organized by the defendant, but that the web form required him to consent not only the participation at such fair, but also to receive commercial communications and even the transfer of such data to third parties; when he requested the defendant to only use his consent for the participation purpose, the defendant answered that it was not possible and that, as it was a free event, the claimant was obliged to receive commercial communications if he chose to participate at the event.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the first AEPD investigation requests stating that: (i) no rights of the claimant were breached, as the processing activities are based on his consent, (ii) the claimant was fully informed at the privacy policy on the need to process his data for the participation, and that the possibility of receiving commercial communication was also specified, (iii) in any case, the commercial emails duly contain the possibility to unsubscribe from them. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure, and the defendant answered again stating that: (i) the participation on the event had one single purpose, which was to communicate the attendants with the companies with a networking objective, and that (ii) the defendant is managing the change of its forms in order to adopt the corresponding measures.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed Article 7 of the GDPR and Article 6(3) of the Spanish Law on Data Protection and Digital Rights Guarantee (LOPDGDD), according to which, (i) commercial communications are a different purpose than attendance to a job fair, so consents for both activities shall be obtained separately, and (ii) the execution of an agreement cannot be subject to the fact that the data subject consents other processing activities not strictly related to performance, development and control of the contract relationship. Consequently, the AEPD decided to impose a warning to the defendant and, additionally, required the defendant to correct the situation in the period of one (1) month since this resolution.
