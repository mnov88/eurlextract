## English Summary

### Facts

The Garante examined a complaint against the publication on the school website of the details of the teaching staff (around 1.500 subjects concerned), including address, phone number, number of children and data concerning health.

### Dispute

The Garante had to assess whether such disclosure was justified and lawful.

### Holding

The Garante considered that the most likely applicable lawful basis for the process of personal data in the public sector is the compliance with a legal obligation or the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority under Article 6 (1) (c) (e) GDPR. In this regard, in the Garante’s view part of the data was disclosed unlawfully with no Article 6 basis for processing. Moreover, the Garante found that the disclosure of the teaching staff personal data contravened the data protection principle of “lawfulness, fairness and transparency” and “data minimization” under Article 5 (1) (a) (c) GDPR. The Garante further found that the school also published data concerning health, failing to respect the prohibition under Article 9 (1) GDPR and without relying on any specific exemptions under Article 9 (2) (4) GDPR.
