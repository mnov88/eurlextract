## English Summary

### Facts

The Complainant filed a complaint before the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against an unnamed data controller (the defendant). The Complainant rented two rooms from the defendant, the property owner. The Complainant claims to have been told by the defendant that the surveillance camera inside only focused on the front door of their property for security.

However, the Complainant later discovered that the camera did not focus only on the door as the defendant showed the Complainant a recording (with sound) of the Complainant breaking the television whilst vacuuming.

The Complainant highlighted to the AEPD that they felt spied on, especially as they had private telephone conversations in parts of the room where the camera also focused on (rather than just the door as claimed by the defendant).

The defendant, the owner of the property, claimed that the video camera was inside their private house and focused on the interior to scare potential thieves. They asserted that they were the only person with access to the data stored on the camera's memory card.

The AEPD found whilst investigating that there was no informational poster on the door of access to the property regarding the video-surveillance camera.

### Dispute

Is the presence of a video surveillance camera placed by the owner of a rented property in violation of Article 5(1)(c)?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) held that the facts highlighted that there was a video surveillance camera installed in a rental property processing personal data without a reason or clear purpose.

The DPA referred to Article 5(1)(c) GDPR on data minimisation. It also highlighted that it is for the individual in charge of camera to comply with the requirement of the law.

The DPA held that when it comes to a property that is rented out (the object of a contract), the notion of personal of "purely personal or household activities" disappears. The owner of the property (that is rented to a third party), who is in charge of the video camera, must comply with the GDPR. The DPA went on to highlight a Constitutional Court decision (nº 22/1984 (Rec.59/1983)) on the concept of a private home, which stated that this is a place where an individual can exercise their freedom more intimately, outside of social conventions.

Therefore, the Spanish DPA concluded that the defendant processed personal data without just cause by filming the complainant inside their rented house. This was particularly because the video camera did not just record the entrance to scare burglars, but instead also filmed some other parts of the property. Therefore, the defendant breach Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

The Spanish DPA imposed a fine of €5,000 on the defendant.

        "That by showing the images to A.A.A., it denies what happened."

                                              I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority
control, and according to what is established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the

rector of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and
to solve this procedure.
                                              II

In the present case, the claim dated 01/30/20 is examined by me-

of which the claimant transfers the following as the main event:
        "Installation of camera in the house that has rented, obtained images
inside the same without just cause ”(folio nº 1).

        The facts are specified in the installation by the defendant of a device
recording (web-cam) you have used to obtain images / sound from the rental

of the same, without justified cause, proceeding to treat the data of this without
there is any apparent reason.

        The art. 5.1 c) RGPD provides the following: Personal data will be:
        “Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed ("data minimization").

        It should be remembered that individuals are responsible for ensuring that systems
most installed comply with current legislation, proving that it complies with
all the requirements demanded by the regulations in force.

        The installation of this type of device must have the mandatory poster
informative, indicating the purposes and responsible for the treatment, where appropriate, of the data
of a personal nature.

        In the present case, we have a lease contract whose

leased object is to satisfy the primary and permanent housing need of the
tenant.

that it allows the landlord to obtain images of the interior of the room (lo-

        The description that the Constitutional Court makes regarding the concept of
micilio, taking as such "the space where the individual lives exercising their freedom

more intimate, outside of social conventions ”.

The inviolability of the home protects not only the physical space itself considered
but what is in it of emanation from the person and his private sphere, having
defined by the Constitutional Court, in its judgment nº 22/1984 (Rec. 59/1983), of 17
February, the inviolable home as: “a space in which the individual lives without

be necessarily subject to social customs and conventions and exercise their freedom more
intimate ”.

        Specifically, the images obtained are used by it to reproduce

interior of the house.

        Manifests before the State Security Forces and Bodies (Declaration

vaccum cleaner. He has thrown the screen and has broken the television, the screen and a design table

        So it is proven that the orientation of the camera was not ex-
clusive as he asserts “only towards the entrance of the door”, since television is

Regarding the alleged non-existence of culpability in the commission of the offending conduct,
Torah. In this sense, there is no doubt that guilt constitutes an essential note in

sanctioning matter and that so-called strict liability has no place in De-
administrative sanctioning right.

Indeed, article 28 of Law 40/2015 (October 1) provides that “They may only
be sanctioned for acts constituting an administrative offense, individuals who

legal, as well as, when a Law recognizes their capacity to act, the groups
types of affected, unions and entities without legal personality and patrimonies
independent or autonomous, who are responsible for them as
fraud or guilt ”.

 This simple non-observance cannot be understood as admission to the Law
administrative sanctioning of strict liability, since the doctrine of the Court

Constitutional (Sentences 15/1999, of July 4, and 76/1990, of April 26) and the
majority prudence of our Supreme Court (for all Judgment of 23 of
January 1998), as well as the requirements inherent to a rule of law, require
that the principle of guilt requires the existence of fraud or fault.

The Supreme Court (Judgments of April 16 and 22, 1991) considers that the ele-

of guilt it follows “that the action or omission, classified as an infringement,
administratively punishable action, must be, in any case, attributable to its author,
due to fraud or recklessness, negligence or inexcusable ignorance. "

The National High Court, in Judgment of June 29, 2001, on protection

of personal data, has stated that “simple negligence or incum-
compliance with the duties that the Law imposes on the persons responsible for files or
of the data processing of extreme diligence ... ”.

The Supreme Court (Judgments of July 5, 1998 and March 2, 1999) comes
understanding that there is recklessness whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded.

The degree of exigency of which will be determined according to the circumstances

professionalism required of the offender. In this sense, the aforementioned Judgment of June 5
1998 demands from professionals in the sector “a duty to know especially the

applicable standards ”.

In the present case, the defendant is responsible for the installation of a web-
cam, having obtained personal data from the denounced, for a purpose not to per-

"Break" of a television of his property, for which the intentionality is accredited

Article 83.5 RGPD provides the following:
