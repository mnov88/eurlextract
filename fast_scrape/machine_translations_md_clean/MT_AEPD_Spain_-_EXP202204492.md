## English Summary

### Facts

A telecommunications service provider, ORANGE ESPAGNE, S.A.U. (the controller), registered a telephone number with a fraudulent third party who used the data subject's personal information. The data subject found out about the theft of their identity after receiving a call from the police informing them that fraud had been committed with the unlawfully contracted telephone number. Subsequently, the data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA.

During the proceedings, the DPA received a written reply from the controller indicating that as soon as it became aware of the facts, it classified the number as an irregular activation, ordering the corresponding adjustments in favour of the data subject. The adjustements included the rectification of any incorrectly issued invoices and documents.

### Holding

The DPA recalled that in order for the processing of personal data to be lawful, it needs to have a legal basis under [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). In this case, the data subject did not consent to the processing nor entered any contract with the controller, rendering any subsequent processing unlawful. Furthermore, the controller did not adequately verify the identity of the person requesting the contract, in order to prevent identity theft.

The DPA held that the controller violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") by concluding a telephone contract with an unauthorised person, giving rise to the theft of the data subject's identity. Pursuant to [Article 83 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR"), the DPA imposed a fine on the controller. The DPA took into account aggravating circumstances provided in [Article 76(2)(b) of the Spanish Data Protection Law](https://boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673&tn=2), following [Article 83(2)(k) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR"), and set a fine of €50,000. In particular, the DPA considered as an aggravating factor the fact that the controller was a telecommunications services provider who processed personal data on a large scale.

However, the controller benefited from reductions due to voluntary payment and acknowledgement of guilt, with the final amount set to €30,000.
