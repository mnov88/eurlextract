## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by Centro Sindical Independiente y de Funcionarios or "CSI-CSIF" (the claimant) stating that the defendant had openly published personal data (name, surname, national ID, mobile phone number, desk phone number, results of the exam to become a temporary public employee, date in which he/she has been phoned by the administration, his/her acceptance or refusal of the job, locations of the job, and notes on each person regarding previous vacancies or cessations in such position); the claimant also attached such list in an Excel file as an evidence of its claim. According to the claimant, such information was available for a week at least at the website of public employment offers by the Principality of Asturias.

### Dispute

After a clarification process in order to determine who is the data controller (the Principality of Asturias as owner of the website, or the ERA as dependent public entity in charge of the job offers and publications), it is determined that the ERA is the data controller. The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests attaching a different copy of the same Excel file provided by the claimant (the copy by the defendant only included names, surnames and incomplete ID numbers), and declaring that, as soon as it knew about the existence of such list, it was immediately blocked, even posting an information message of "list currently not available". During its investigations, the AEPD discovered that the information contained in such list was dated 2015, so it totally fulfilled its function and should have been deleted before. The defendant did not explain which measures have been taken in order to avoid the exposure of personal data once the purpose of such exposure (transparency on public employment offers) has been completed. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the publication of the personal data of the temporary public employees has infringed the lawfulness principle, so, after considering Article 77 of the Spanish Law on Personal Data Protection and Digital Rights Guarantee or "LOPDGDD" (according to which public entities shall not be punished with economic fines), it imposed a warning to the defendant. The AEPD also requires the defendant to take the corresponding measures to ensure that personal data related to job offers or job pools are no longer available once their purpose and expiry period have been completed.

5/84)The defendant has not reported “ the measures implemented so that lists with datapersonnel of job offers or job boards are not visible when it has been fulfilledits purpose, exposure period and data blocking. " that was contained in the proposal.FOUNDATIONS OF LAWIBy virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority ofcontrol, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of theSpanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve thisprocess.IIA first question arises that the BOE list is of 10 people, whichThe object of the complaint appears is 140. The type, purpose and legitimacy have not been given.of the exposure of the 140 members of the list, since it does not appear related to the BOPA.There is no legitimate basis for the aforementioned exposition, for which reason the claim wasinfringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD that states: " Legality of the treatment " "1 . Treatment aloneit will be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met : "listing different ones, notnone of them concurring for the treatment carried out on the page indicated suchas it has been done.Although an infraction of article 6.1 of the RGPD was imputed, in the proposal ofresolution, the classification of the offense is changed, as it is considered more appropriate to classifythe facts that are the object of the complaint as included in article 5.1 a). Thus, the exposure andpublication of the lists with the data: ID, name and surname, and landline telephone numbersand / or mobiles, and results of calls with annotations, in the electronic headquarters of thePrincipality of Asturias with access for anyone, supposes an infringement of the aforementionedarticle, as there is no legitimation for the set of elements that are published,adding that it could be a process already completed since 2015 andremains exposed.Article 5.1.a) of the RGPD indicates: “ The personal data will be:to)treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party("Lawfulness, fairness and transparency");The exposed document could rather be classified as an internal document ofmanagement, by being contained as a block, data that must not be exposed for publicitythat seeks the concurrence of the processes, whether it is job boards or any otherselective process. After the development of the tests it seems that a list is made onwhich annotations are produced, and in no case is there legal authorization to exhibit in aweb, in electronic headquarters said list to the knowledge of third parties. It could be due to an error thatdenotes lack of diligence. Therefore, there is no legitimizing cause that enables the exhibitionof the data in open electronic office as it was given, a kind of management documentof the process that is not related to qualifications or transparency when exceedingsaid elements.C / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es

6/8In addition, as a basic principle of the RGPD, when processing data, it has always beento opt for the minimum data necessary for the group of affected people to achieve their goal. I knowIt thus accredits the commission of the violation of article 5.1. a) of the RGPD.Likewise, it must be understood that the listings should not remain on the page as they haveits purpose has been fulfilled and the claimed party does not justify reasons that in the processing of thisprocedure, these lists survived, even with an incomplete DNI.IIIArticle 83.5 of the RGPD"5.
