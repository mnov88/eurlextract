## English Summary

### Facts

The controller, Tensa Art Design SA, was an optician and merchant for glasses, sunglasses as well as contact lenses. As part of its business the controller was sending commercial messages.

A data subject, objected to receiving the commercial messages as foreseen by [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"), by unsubscribing from the newsletter service. Yet, the controller continued to send commercial communications to the data subject's phone number via SMS in a frequent manner. Consequently, the data subject filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA, prompting the DPA to investigate the matter.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller's conduct was a violation of the GDPR. Pursuant to [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR") data subjects have the right to object to processing which is done based either on the legal basis of [Article 6(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") (public interest) or [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") (legitimate interest). Moreover, [Article 21(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR") specifically grants data subjects the right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes.

During the investigation, the DPA found that the controller did not present evidence from which it could be concluded that it reacted to the request of the data subject in accordance with [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR") and did not provide the data subject with an answer, within the month of the request, regarding the measures adopted following the exercise of the right to objection.

The DPA decided that the controller violated [Article 12(3)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR") by not respecting the data subject's objection. Based on its powers pursuant to [Article 58(2)(i) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR"), the DPA fined the controller €1,000 (RON 4,947.9). Moreover, based on [Article 58(2)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR"), the DPA ordered the controller to take the necessary measures to modify the existing procedures at the company level and communicate them to the employees, in order to ensure that its processing of personal data respect the rights of data subjects under the GDPR.

## Comment

Unfortunately, the Romanian DPA does not publish its full decisions. This summary is based on a press release. Although it is not directly stated in the case, it is strongly suggested that the controller carried out such processing activities on the basis of legitimate interest.

As such, the operator was fined 4,947.9 lei (equivalent to 1,000 EURO).

During the investigation carried out, it was found that the operator sent unsolicited commercial messages to the person in question, via SMS, repeatedly, although he had previously requested, via e-mail, to unsubscribe from the newsletter service.

During the investigation, it was found that the operator Tensa Art Design SA did not present evidence from which it could be concluded that it resolved the request of the person concerned in accordance with the provisions of art. 12 para.

At the same time, as part of the investigation, the operator was also given the corrective measure to take the necessary measures to modify the existing procedures at the company level and bring them to the knowledge of the employees, so that the rights of the persons concerned provided by the Regulation are respected in all cases (EU) 679/2016.
