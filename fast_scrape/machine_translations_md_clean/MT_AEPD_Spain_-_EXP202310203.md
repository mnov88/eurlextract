## English Summary

### Facts

In March 2023, a residential association, L.L.L. Proprietor’s Community L.L.L. (controller) posted a list of co-owners of the property who owed outstanding funds to the association on a locked bulletin board in the building’s lobby. The debtors were identifiable by reference to a second notice which had been also been placed in the bulletin board which listed the property owners who had attended an association meeting.

The list was also exposed to many individuals who were not part of the resident’s association, as over a hundred of the apartments in the building were occupied by tourists on short stays.

The association had also shared on a couple of occasions, via email to the co-owners, lists detailing the debtors. These lists contained multiple errors, incorrectly identifying some co-owners as debtors when they had in fact paid, and had to be corrected and recirculated.

A group of ten data subject residents in the building filed a complaint with the AEPD on June 29 2023.

During the investigation, the controller argued that as the debtors were only identified on the lists by apartment number, no infringement of the GDPR had occurred.

### Holding

The DPA rejected the controller’s assertion that the GDPR did not apply to the processing in question. The DPA noted that the listing of the apartment number allowed for the identification of the owners, and thus constituted personal data, rendering the GDPR applicable.

The DPA held that the controller had infringed the principle of confidentiality in [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") for failing to ensure the appropriate security of personal data. The DPA imposed a fine €2000 on the controller.

SANCTIONING PROCEDURE RESOLUTION

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based

on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter, complainant 1), B.B.B. (hereinafter, complainant 2), C.C.C. (hereinafter, complainant 3), D.D.D. (hereinafter, complainant 4), E.E.E. (hereinafter, complainant 5), F.F.F. (hereinafter, complainant 6), G.G.G. (hereinafter, complainant 7), H.H.H. (hereinafter, Complainant 8), I.I.I.I (hereinafter, Complainant 9), and J.J.J. (hereinafter, Complainant 10) filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency on June 29, 2023. The complaint is filed against the
\*\*\*COMUNIDAD DE PROPIETARIOS L.L.L. with Tax Identification Number \*\*\*NIF.1 (hereinafter, the Respondent). The grounds for the claim are as follows:

The complainants state that on March 7, 2023, a list of co-owners in debt was posted on the bulletin board (locked) in the building's lobby, visible to anyone who passes by. The list is identified by apartment number. Another bulletin board (locked) in the aforementioned lobby displays minutes of the meeting dated March 7, 2018, containing a list of the owners attending, which allows the debtors to be identified.

They also indicate that the respondent has sent lists of debtors by email to the co-owners on several occasions, with errors in the data and without justification for their sending.

Along with the claim, the following documentation is provided, among other things:

 Notice dated March 31, 2023, from the community administration, sent by email, attaching a list of the community's debtors.

 Photo of the list by name and apartment number posted on a bulletin board (corresponding to minutes of the Ordinary General Meeting of community owners dated March 7, 2018).

 Photo of the list posted on another board, containing a list of non-payments, including the apartment number of the community in question.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/16

 Email dated 04/03/2023 correcting the list of defaulters published on March 31, 2023 (Updated list of defaults).

 Email dated April 5 correcting the error, explaining that due to a computer error, not all payments had been recorded (new updated list of defaults).

In this regard, the complainants indicate that the publication of the list of debtors on the notice board would have occurred outside the circumstances provided for in Articles 16.2 and 21.3 of Law 49/1960, of July 21, on horizontal property.
Furthermore, to further disseminate the aforementioned list of debtors, it was published on the Homeowners' Association's bulletin board on March 7, 2023.

They also state that although the list accompanying the communication of March 31, 2023, and published on the bulletin board on March 7, 2023, includes the apartment number (not a nominal number), with this information, the owners could easily identify the alleged debtors, with the help of the minutes of the general meetings from previous years and through the information posted on nearby bulletin boards. The list of alleged debtors would be publicly displayed, including to people outside the community, as the noticeboard in question is located in the lobby of the building, visible to everyone, where there is "intense traffic of hundreds of tourists who spend the night weekly in the tourist apartments (there are approximately 115 tourist apartments with high occupancy)." In this way, they claim, anyone could determine the identity of the alleged debtor by checking the record posted on the other noticeboard for the name of the owner of each apartment number.

SECOND: On July 5, 2023, the claimants filed an "extension of claim" with this Agency. The reasons for the extension

are as follows, according to the plaintiffs:

"FIRST FACT OF THE EXTENSION: The aforementioned Homeowners' Association called an extraordinary general meeting on May 22nd by email (DOCUMENT 11), to be held on June 1st. This call was accompanied by a list of alleged unpaid

amounts as of May 22nd, 2023 (on the last page of this document). The minutes of this general meeting were sent to the owners on June 23rd by email
(DOCUMENT 12). Pages 8 to 17 include a list of the building's owners, identifying their ownership (apartment number, parking space number, etc.)
and the first and last names of each owner. This allows all owners to easily, directly, and unequivocally establish a relationship between the two pieces of information
(alleged delinquency of the apartments, with the personal data of the owners of each apartment). As explained in point 2 of the complaint filed, which we now expand upon, the repeated sending of lists of unpaid debts allowed for nominal identification, and this is further facilitated by the repeated sending to the owners of various lists of alleged unpaid debts (several of them erroneous). Further supporting and consolidating the arguments, the aforementioned report (DOCUMENT 12), sent shortly after the irregular publication of the list of unpaid debts, in any case allows for the establishment of this unequivocal relationship between the property listed and its owner. C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/16

SECOND FACT OF THE EXTENSION On July 4, the Administrator sent all owners a "miscellaneous matters" communication by email, which includes a

new list of alleged defaulters (DOCUMENT 13). Again, and as explained in the previous fact, although each supposedly debtor owner is identified by their apartment or garage number, it is possible to easily, directly, and unequivocally establish, by name, who the owner of each property is, since a little over a week earlier, a record listing these properties with their owners had been circulated to all owners. This statement reiterates

ONCE AGAIN the reported violation of personal data protection, as it is carried out outside the provisions of the Horizontal Property Law, that is, without there being, at that time, as of July 4, 2023, (1) any call for a general meeting or (2) the slightest attempt to notify each debtor in advance in accordance with the provisions of said law (e.g., Arts. 16.2 and 21.3 of the LPH).

The Governing Board reiterates the irregularity noted in its community on March 31, 2023 (DOCUMENT 03) of publishing a list of defaulters on a monthly basis, something SERIOUSLY IRREGULAR, both due to the mere fact itself (since such publication is routinely carried out outside the conditions permitted by the LPH) and due to its repetitive nature.

Along with this new document, the following documentation is provided:

 Email dated May 22, 2023, calling for an Extraordinary Community Meeting on June 1, 2023, attaching a list of debtors.

 Email dated June 23, sending the minutes of the Extraordinary Meeting, attaching a list of attendees.
 Email dated July 4, 2023, sending a communication to the owners, attaching a list of debtors.

THIRD: In accordance with Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), this claim was forwarded to the respondent party so that they could analyze it and inform this Agency within one month of the actions taken to address the issue. comply with the requirements set forth in data protection regulations.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), was notified on September 15, 2023, and September 29, 2023, respectively, to the Administration and Governing Board of the Community, as recorded in the acknowledgments of receipt included in the file.

On October 27, 2023, this Agency received a response letter stating, among other things, the following:

“\[…\] the AEPD has already ruled on several occasions that there is no data protection violation regarding the posting of a list of defaulters on the notice board, but only mentioning the apartment or premises.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/16

It should be noted that the document published on the notice board is a table showing the apartments and garages that make up the Community. Therefore, the AEPD indicates that the aforementioned document does not show information that is easily decipherable by anyone outside the community and that the owners of the properties are not identified.

Up to this point, the publication of the lists of delinquencies is justified, without identifying the debtors."

And regarding the posting of the Minutes of the Ordinary General Meeting of owners of the community dated March 7, 2018, on the bulletin board, which includes the list of owners and the number of apartments, the defendant states the following:

"The community of owners, through its governing bodies or its administration, has never posted such a list on the aforementioned bulletin board. This list has been artificially posted, presumably by the complainants, some of whom are precisely those with the highest debts to the community.
" Even though the notice board is locked, it is possible to insert papers through the gaps in the glass, and, coincidentally, as the photographs provided by the complainants show... the 2018 minutes are open and folded horizontally by the list of owners in attendance, when it would be normal, reasonable, and logical, if it had been displayed or published by the community, it would be vertically and on the first page...

Furthermore, it makes no sense for a 2018 record to be displayed, as by the date the complainants allegedly took the photo, two more meetings had already been held in the community…”

FOURTH: On September 30, 2023, in accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), the complaint filed by the complainant was admitted for processing.

FIFTH: On January 9, 2024, the complainants filed a second extension of the complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The reasons for the extension of the complaint are as follows, as explained by the complainants:

“From the allegations made by the opposing party in response to our original complaint and the first extension of its facts, it is clear that the opposing party either did not fully understand the subject of the complaint or, knowing this, is attempting to divert attention. The communication and publication of lists of defaulters with the calls for general meetings, or the corresponding minutes of these meetings, is not denounced. This is perfectly legal, and nothing to the contrary has ever been said. What is being denounced is, precisely, the use of such lists outside of such legally defined and very specific circumstances.

The specific fact that the publication of the aforementioned lists of "defaulters" in question is not by name (a publication that, in itself, is outside the legally established circumstances for this purpose) is completely irrelevant. As
we explained in our complaint and now reiterate on the occasion of the new

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/16

communication that has been made to the contrary, repeating the error, the possibility and ease for any owner of Eurobuilding 2 to link the names and surnames of owners with the numbers of their corresponding apartments and/or parking spaces is immediate, undeniable, and obvious.

On November 20, 2023, the building administrator circulated
by email to all owners a list of defaulters (DOCUMENT 14, NEW DOCUMENT, last page) attached to a circular from the Governing Board...

As on previous occasions, the list included in this latest communication of November 20 contains the amount of the alleged debts along with the apartment or parking space number. It is not nominal, but this information is sufficient to easily identify the "alleged" defaulters, since the minutes of the Extraordinary General Meeting held on June 1, 2023 were sent by email to all owners and

recorded the equivalence between the number of each apartment or parking space and the identifying data of their respective owners...

In relation to the THIRD fact of the complaint, regarding the PUBLIC display of the personal data of those affected, also TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY, we recall that this was posted on two bulletin boards in the

building lobby, thus violating the conditions set forth in Articles 1 and 2. 16.2 and 9.2 of the L.P.H.: that is, there was no call for a general meeting of owners, nor had the attempt to summon or notify the owners of their alleged delinquency failed.

That is, in the case of the publication of the data of the delinquent owners on the bulletin board, this could ONLY be done when it had not been possible to deliver the notice of the meeting in legal form. And to proceed in this manner, the attempts at notification must be proven, which is impossible because such prior individual notices were never issued.

Well, now, the defendants, with the intention of denying their actions, accuse the plaintiffs, wantonly and without any basis, of having inserted a list of owners' names into one of the two notice boards through the crack. This accusation is completely FALSE; we reject it completely, emphatically, and vigorously, and it falls flat on its own. This is so true that, if you look at the photograph of the board (DOCUMENT 05 of the complaint), you will see that, if an object were inserted through the gap in the board, it would fall to the right of the board, but never, never (because it would be materially impossible) on its left end…"

Along with the extension of the claim, the following documentation, among others, is provided:

- Email dated 11/20/2023 in which the periodic management report and a new list of debtors with the apartment number and the debt are sent.

- Photos of the notice boards with the documents distributed.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/16

SIXTH: On March 19, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the respondent,
for the alleged violation of Article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

SEVENTH: On April 8, 2024, this Agency received, in a timely manner, a written statement from the respondent party, in which they submitted allegations regarding the initiation agreement. In these allegations, in summary, it stated that:

"FIRST: Violation of the Principle of Personality of Sanctions and consequent violation of Article 25 of the Spanish Constitution.

It is, at the very least, contradictory (if not completely erroneous) and confusing

to note and cite articles of the LPH that correspond to the call for the General Meeting and to state that it was through said call and the publication of the list of delinquent owners on the Community's notice board and the repeated emailing of lists of defaulters that this party violated the principle of confidentiality in the processing of personal data.

The conduct that the complainants (many of whom do not live in the building nor are harmed in any way by the facts they falsely report, and some, like J.J.J., who is not even an owner) reveal can be summarized in two Groups: On the one hand, it is said that on one of the two bulletin boards in the Community's lobby, a list of debtors identified by apartment number was posted on March 7, 2023. This is absolutely false, since, as this party has already had the opportunity to point out, the document in question does not show information that is easily decipherable by anyone outside the community. The owners of the homes are NOT IDENTIFIED; that is, the apartment or premises are indicated, along with the delinquency status and the amount, which in the case of the building is very high (almost 10% of the annual budget), and this is the reason that forced the Community's Governing Board to act in this manner. Therefore, said publication does not constitute the violation alleged against the Community,

since the communication of data relating to persons not provided for as such in the Horizontal Property Law is permitted, by inserting data without one of the objectives set forth in articles 9, 15, and 16 of the LPH. The publication of the Community's list of defaulters on the notice board is intended to ensure compliance with the notification requirements of the LPH for the validity of the calls,

which in that case was made for an Extraordinary Community Meeting. Since there were more than 340 owners in the community, and some of them provided email addresses for notification purposes that were rejected, such publication was necessary (there was no record of its receipt), without it being necessary to state the reasons for the publication, since the LPH does not require it. We therefore insist that the document posted on the notice board is a table listing the apartments and garages that owe the Community. Therefore, the aforementioned document does not show information that is easily decipherable by anyone outside the Community, as the owners of the homes are not identified.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/16

Therefore, there has been no violation of data protection regulations.
Therefore, the present proceedings must be closed at this point.

SECOND. - Violation of Article 24 of the Spanish Constitution due to infringement of the guarantees established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations.

The extension of the fundamental right to the presumption of innocence—Article 24, section 2, of the Constitution—to the scope of administrative sanctions was declared by the Constitutional Court in Judgments Nos. 13/1982, 36/1985, and 76/1990.

The foregoing doctrine is applicable to the present case because, in the opinion of this party, there are serious procedural defects observed in the Administrative File. As we have seen, since there is no specific charge against the actual offender, there is no possibility of attributing any liability to my client, as her direct participation in the events has not been proven, since the information contained in the file initiating this sanctioning procedure is inaccurate.

And that is the reason why, with a clearly biased nature, the diligence of the complainants in noticing the presence of the minutes of the 2018 General Owners' Meeting on the Community's bulletin board is noted, which, we insist, is not true in the present case.

This lack of defense and the lack of evidence in the administrative sanctioning file due to the lack of veracity in the facts stated in the complaints filed must lead to the filing of the same, since the procedural guarantees proclaimed in Article 24 of the Spanish Constitution require the complaining Administration to observe them. It cannot be forgotten that this is a sanctioning procedure, in which the principle of presumption of innocence must prevail, as long as it is not destroyed.

EVIDENCE Testimony, so that the investigating judge of the Sanctioning File may summon the following persons to the address of my client:
1.- Mr. M.M.M., Secretary Administrator of the Community, with National Identity Document \*\*\*Tax Identification Number 2
2.- Ms. N.N.N., with National Identity Document \*\*\*Tax Identification Number ... \*\*\*NIF.3

The summons sent to the witnesses proposed by this party to clarify the facts attributed to my client must state the day, time, and place where they must appear, and they may do so, if appropriate, accompanied by a lawyer or advisor. Consequently, the Investigating Officer is requested to make all necessary arrangements for the presentation of this evidence, which our client considers essential for the defense of its interests.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/16

EIGHTH: On May 24, 2024, after the period for objections granted in the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings No. PS/00056/2024, it was agreed to open a period for presenting evidence, as provided in Articles 77 and 78 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code). It was agreed to reproduce for evidentiary purposes the notification of the breach that gave rise to this file and its documentation, the objections to the agreement to initiate the aforementioned sanctioning proceedings, presented by \*\*\*COMUNIDAD DE PROPIETARIOS L.L.L. , and the accompanying documentation, as well as to produce documentary evidence, requiring \*\*\*COMUNIDAD DE PROPIETARIOS L.L.L. to Within a maximum period of TEN BUSINESS DAYS, the Agency shall submit to the Agency the respective statements of responsibility from the two witnesses proposed in the allegations submitted to the initiation agreement, in which they shall report on all matters they consider pertinent regarding the security breach, as well as any other information they consider relevant to the case.

It was also agreed to discard the witness evidence proposed by \*\*\*COMUNIDAD DE

PROPIETARIOS L.L.L. in its written statement of allegations to the agreement to initiate this proceeding, consisting of summoning the two indicated witnesses, since with the statements of responsibility they will be able to state whatever is necessary to clarify the alleged facts.

The notification of the opening of the evidentiary period, which was carried out in accordance with the

rules established in the LPACAP, was notified on May 26, 2024, as recorded in the acknowledgment of receipt in the file.

NINTH: Once the period granted for documentary evidence has elapsed, it has been determined that no declaration of responsibility has been received from the respondent.

TENTH: On July 24, 2024, a resolution proposal was made, proposing that the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency sanction \*\*\*COMUNIDAD DE PROPIETARIOS L.L.L., with Tax Identification Number \*\*\*NIF.1, for a violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, with a fine of €2,000. Although the receipt of the proposal is recorded in the file, no objections to it have been received.

From the actions taken in this proceeding and the documentation in the file, the following have been established:

LEGAL BASIS

I
Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of the GDPR and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act),

the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, this Organic Law, the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures." II
Preliminary Questions

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the GDPR, personal data processing is established, since the respondent carries out, among other processing, the collection, recording, organization, dissemination

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/16

and storage of, among others, the following personal data of natural persons: name, identification number, location data, email address, and financial data related to the Homeowners' Association.

The respondent carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, given that it determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to Article 4.7 of the GDPR.

Article 4, section 12 of the GDPR broadly defines “personal data security breaches” (hereinafter, security breaches) as “any breach of security that results in the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, or in unauthorized communication of or access to such data.”

In the present case, there is a personal data breach in the circumstances indicated above, categorized as a breach of confidentiality, as lists of defaults were sent by email to all community members and were visible on the community's bulletin board, not falling within the conditions permitted by Law 49/1960, of July 21, on Horizontal Property (hereinafter, LPH).

According to the Article 29 Working Party, a "Breach of Confidentiality" occurs when there is an unauthorized or accidental disclosure of, or access to, personal data.

As part of the processing principles set forth in Article 5 of the GDPR, the integrity and confidentiality of personal data is guaranteed in Section 1.f) of Article 5 of the GDPR.

III
Allegations regarding the Initiation Agreement

Regarding the allegations made regarding the initiation agreement for this sanctioning procedure, the following are addressed in the order set forth by the respondent, as already transcribed above:

FIRST: In it, the respondent alleged that, in relation to the publication on the bulletin board, the information posted only included the apartment and the debt (never the owner). Therefore, it would not constitute "easily decipherable information."
Furthermore, it points out the difficulties they have in convening meetings, given that there are numerous owners and many of the emails sent were unsuccessful.

Regarding this allegation, it should be noted that the floor name is personal information that identifies the owner of the property, so we cannot agree with the complainant's argument that the personal information posted on the bulletin board is not "easily decipherable information."

Furthermore, regarding this allegation, this Agency wishes to point out several issues, as follows:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/16

Although personal data protection regulations generally prohibit the publication of lists of debtors and debts to the community on a notice board, they do allow publication in specific cases, provided that the reason for such publication is expressly stated. First, in regard to the calling of a meeting of owners, so that they can be informed of possible limitations on the voting rights of owners who are not up to date with their dues. The other scenario would involve the notification of community debts when this could not be carried out in accordance with Article 9 of the LPH. This is stated in the Property Management Sector Guide, published regarding homeowners' associations, which states the following:

"Generally, the publication on the community's notice board of a list of owners who are not up to date with their dues is not covered by data protection regulations. However, the LPH allows the publicity of the identity of debtors and their debts to the community, incorporating said information into the notice of the meeting. Exceptionally, when there is no record of an owner's address because they have not provided this information to the community, the notice of the meeting of owners may be published on the community's notice board—or in another visible place of general use designated for this purpose. In this case, the reasons for such publication must be stated along with the published document, and a formal notice must be issued by the person acting as secretary."

The respondent has not proven that the publication on the community's bulletin board was made after unsuccessful attempts to notify the debt, in accordance with Article 9 of the LPH.

In this regard, the respondent's claim that the processing consisting of the publication of debts, which includes only the apartment and the debt, does not constitute "easily decipherable information" cannot be accepted. The publication of personal data on the community's bulletin board outside the cases established in the LPH constituted a violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, as it entailed a lack of confidentiality.

It should be remembered that, according to Article 4.1 of the GDPR, personal data is considered to be "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is any person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person."

The aforementioned guide also states the following:

“The publication of the list of owners with overdue and unpaid installments, through a single, periodic communication sent to each of them, is also not covered by data protection regulations. Even in the
case where no express mention is made of the personal identification of the debtors, referring only to the data relating to the property, such

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/16

communication is also not in compliance with data protection regulations, since
such data or reference is always associated with that of the owner of the property, so there is no doubt that it will be personal data, as it refers to

identifiable natural persons.”

In this regard, the respondent has sent lists of debtors up to seven times by email, referring to the property, without these lists being included in the call for any community meeting outside of what is established in the LPH, which constitutes a violation of the confidentiality of the personal data for which the respondent is responsible.

For all the above reasons, this claim is dismissed.

SECOND: This allegation, apart from generic statements such as the lack of sufficient evidence or the indeterminacy of the offending party, refers to the inclusion on a second notice board of a 2018 homeowners' association record. Regarding this record, the defendant indicates that it was not posted by them, pointing out that, although the board is locked, the record was posted by a person who posted only one page of the record from the outside, which is why it is missing. They also point out that it is a record from five years ago. This record contained the list of owners by name and, according to the claim, would, in turn, make it possible for the debtors to be identified in the list contained on the previous board (which contains only apartments and debts).

Well, in this regard, it must be stated that the existence of this second board and the list it contains would be completely irrelevant. The truth is that, as indicated in the response to the previous allegation, the mere publication of a list indicating the apartment and the debt makes the owners, who are allegedly debtors, identifiable, and should only be done under the circumstances and conditions provided for in the Public Prosecutor's Law on Property Rights, as indicated above.

Regarding the alleged lack of evidence, it is understood that this statement is based on the respondent's belief that the inclusion of the minutes on the second notice board was not made by the respondent itself, but by third parties. Since this fact, as stated, is irrelevant, it is of no consequence.

The main facts (publication of the initial list on the notice board and sending of the emails, with the aforementioned attached documentation) are acknowledged by the respondent.

For all the above reasons, this allegation is dismissed.

IV
Principle of Integrity and Confidentiality

Article 5.1.f) “Principles relating to processing” of the GDPR establishes:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/16

“1. Personal data shall be:
(…)
f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, by applying appropriate technical or organizational measures (“integrity and confidentiality”).”

In the present case, it was established that the personal data of the affected parties, contained in the respondent's database, was improperly disclosed to third parties on

repeated occasions: via email dated March 24, 2023, in which the complainants and other owners were mentioned by name and surname, classifying them as defaulters, and on March 31, 2023, April 3, 2023, April 5, 2023, July 4, 2023, and November 20, 2023, in lists of defaulters for all community members. Furthermore, the list of defaulters was posted on the community's bulletin board for viewing by third parties outside the community on March 7, 2023. Both facts are reflected by the emails provided in the complaint and the photos of the bulletin board provided by the complainant.

The case file does not show, nor has it been provided by the respondent, that either the posting on the bulletin board or the emailing of lists of debtors was made in response to a meeting of the homeowners' association. Nor is there any evidence that the posting on the board was due to the need for debt notification, as neither the respondent has alleged this nor has it provided documentation of previous attempts at notification to prove it.

It is therefore concluded that the publication of personal data on the community's bulletin board and the repeated emailing of lists of defaulters constitute a violation of the principle of confidentiality in the processing of personal data, and the defendant is responsible for this. It should be noted that:

- The personal data of debtors are not published on the bulletin board as part of a notice of the homeowners' association meeting.

- Nor are they published on the bulletin board as an additional procedure and after an attempt to notify the alleged debts, since this circumstance has not been proven.

- Furthermore, the emails in which the successive lists of debtors were sent did not correspond to notices of the homeowners' association meeting.

It would also be confirmed that the complainant sent a certified letter to the administrator on April 10, 2023, warning of improper conduct by sending the list of debtors on an ongoing basis and outside the circumstances covered by the LPH. C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/16

According to the aforementioned AEPD Guide for property administrators, the circumstances in which data may be published on a notice board or sent to the owners of the community's debtors are as follows:

“(…) the Horizontal Property Law, in its objective of ensuring that communities can legitimately collect what is owed to them by their co-owners, provides the possibility of publicizing, through the convening of the Owners' Meeting, the identity of those persons who are not current in the payment of all their outstanding debts to the community. This publicity entails that all co-owners are aware of the identity of the debtors, as well as the amount of their debt, without it being necessary to obtain their consent.

In turn, the LPH establishes that among the obligations of each owner is the obligation to notify the person acting as secretary of the community, by any means that provides proof of receipt, of the address in Spain for the purposes of summons and notifications related to the community. Failing this notification, the address for summons and notifications will be the apartment or premises belonging to the community, and those delivered to the occupant thereof will have full legal effect.

If, upon attempted summons or notification to the owner, it is impossible to serve it in the place provided for in the previous paragraph, it will be deemed to have been served by posting the corresponding communication on the community's notice board, or in a visible place of general use
designated for this purpose, with a diligence stating the date and reasons for this form of notification, signed by the person acting as secretary of the community, with the approval of the president. The notification made in this manner will produce full legal effects within three calendar days."

Based on the evidence available at this time in the resolution of the sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the known facts constitute an infringement, attributable to the respondent, for violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR.

V
Classification and classification of the infringement of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR for the purposes of the statute of limitations

The aforementioned infringement of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR entails the commission of the infringements classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, which, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines," provides:

"Infringements of the following provisions shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000. or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher:
a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9; (…)”

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72 “Infringements considered very serious” of the LOPDGDD states:

“1. Pursuant to Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:
a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees established in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

VI
Penalty for violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence available at the current time of the resolution of the sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the violation committed by violating the provisions of Article 5.1.f of the GDPR, allows for the imposition of a penalty of €2,000 (two thousand euros).

Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: TO IMPOSE on \*\*\*COMUNIDAD DE PROPIETARIOS L.L.L., with NIF
\*\*\*NIF.1, for a violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, a fine of 2,000 euros.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to \*\*\*COMUNIDAD DE PROPIETARIOS L.L.L.

THIRD: This resolution will become enforceable once the deadline for filing the optional appeal for reconsideration (one month from the day following notification of this resolution) expires, without the interested party having exercised this right.

The sanctioned party is advised that they must pay the imposed sanction once this resolution becomes enforceable, in accordance with the provisions of Article 98.1.b) of the LPACAP, within the voluntary payment period established in Article 10. 68 of the General Collection Regulations, approved by Royal Decree 939/2005, of July 29, in conjunction with Article 62 of Law 58/2003, of December 17, by depositing the fine,

indicating the sanctioned party's NIF (Tax Identification Number) and the procedure number shown in the heading of this document, into the restricted account IBAN: ES00-0000-
0000-0000-0000-0000 (BIC/SWIFT Code: CAIXESBBXXX), opened in the name of the Spanish Data Protection Agency at CAIXABANK, S.A.
Otherwise, collection will be carried out during the enforcement period.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/16

Once the notification is received and enforced, if the enforcement date is between the 1st and 15th of each month, inclusive, the deadline to make the voluntary payment will be the 20th of the following month or the next business day after, and if it is between the 16th and last day of each month, inclusive, the payment deadline will be the 5th of the second following month or the next business day after.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 50 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data), this Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.

Against this resolution, which terminates the administrative process pursuant to Art. 48.6 of the LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 123 of the LPACAP, interested parties may optionally file an appeal for reconsideration before the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency within one month from the day following notification of this resolution, or directly file an administrative appeal before the Administrative Litigation Division of the National Court, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25 and Section 5 of the Fourth Additional Provision of Law 29/1998, of July 13, regulating the Administrative Litigation Jurisdiction, within two months from the day following notification of this decision, as provided for in Article 46.1 of the aforementioned Law.

Finally, it is noted that pursuant to the provisions of Art. 90.3 a) of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Procedure Act), a final administrative decision may be provisionally suspended if the interested party expresses their intention to file an administrative appeal.
If this is the case, the interested party must formally notify this fact in writing to the Spanish Data Protection Agency, submitting it through the Agency's Electronic Registry \[https://sedeagpd.gob.es/sede-electronica-web/\], or through one of the other registries provided for in Article 16.4 of the aforementioned Law 39/2015, of October 1. They must also forward to the Agency the documentation proving the effective filing of the administrative appeal. If the Agency does not become aware of the filing of the administrative appeal within two months from the day following notification of this resolution, it will terminate the provisional suspension.
