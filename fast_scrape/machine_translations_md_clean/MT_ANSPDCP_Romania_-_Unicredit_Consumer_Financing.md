## English Summary

### Facts

Unicredit Consumer Financing, the controller, notified the DPA about a data breach in line with its obligations under [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"). This data breach included the name, surname, position, signature of their former employees, the data subjects.

The controller reported that the data was included in certain contractual documents and used in relationships with clients and collaborators, even after employment contracts had been terminated.

The Romanian DPA started an investigation on the matter.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller processed the data subject´s data due to an operational error which led to the use of versions of documents with outdated signatories. Thus, the controller violated the principles laid out in [Article 5(1)(a), (f) and (2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 32(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

The controller also failed to provide a legal basis for the processing of such data and thus violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

Therefore, the DPA deemed it appropriate to impose a fine of RON 24,885 (€5,000).

The DPA also ordered the controller to implement a plan to monitor the application of the relevant procedures to ensure GDPR compliance, especially in relation to the processing of personal data of employees that terminate the contractual employment relationship with the controller.
