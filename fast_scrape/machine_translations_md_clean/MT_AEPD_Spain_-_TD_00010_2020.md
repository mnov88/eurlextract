## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant terminated his contractual relationship with Vodafone España in 2017, but continued to receive emails from the latter stating that invoices had been issued in his name. The complainant then filed a complaint with the AEPD in 2019 on the basis that he had been unable to exercise his right to oppose the processing of his personal data, as protected under Article 21 GDPR.

### Dispute

Did Vodafone España violate the complainant's rights under Article 21 by continuing to issue the invoices?

### Holding

The AEPD held that complaint was valid, as the complainant's right to object had not been met. The AEPD ordered Vodafone España to comply with Article 21 and stop the processing within ten working days following notification of this decision. If Vodafone España decided not to comply, they would have to give reasons for continuing to process the complainant's personal data. The AEPD concluded that failure to do one of these actions would result in further sanctioning of Vodafone España by the AEPD pursuant to Article 72(1)(m).

## Comment

The AEPD does not specify the provision of Article 21 on which it bases its decision. Article 21 GDPR states that the data subject either has the right to object if the processing uses the legal bases of public or legitimate interest (Article 21(1)), or if the personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes (Article 21(2)).

However the question of whether either of these provisions apply in this case, which would confirm whether Article 21 definitively applies at all, is never examined by the AEPD.
