## English Summary

### Facts

The German Football Association (DFB) (controller) has issued a regulation for player agents. Player agents are consultants for professional footballers, e.g. for the arrangement of club transfers. The player agent regulation contains a provision according to which players or football clubs are obliged to disclose details of the remuneration of player agent services to the DFB or similar bodies.

A director of a player agency (data subject) claimed injunctive relief against this disclosure requirement under [§§ 1004,](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1004.html) [823 German Civil Code](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__823.html) (BGB) in conjunction with [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). In their opinion, the disclosure requirement violates [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

### Holding

The Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main (OLG Frankfurt) balanced the interests of the parties pursuant to [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

It found that, within the framework of the balancing of interests of [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), the data subject's interests lie in the confidentiality of the requested data.

On the side of the controller, who issues the regulations, the legitimate interest of transparency and traceability of arrangements of player transfers is pursued in order to exclude that sports operations are not dominated by unjustified financial interests of third parties.

The OLG Frankfurt concluded that the interests of the defendant prevail.

## Comment

The OLG Frankfurt does not provide detailed explanations as to why the interests of the DFB prevail. It only states the respective interests.

It should be noted that the decision only deals with data protection law to a very limited extent. The core of the decision is antitrust considerations.
