## English Summary

### Facts

An employee of the controller notified the DPA of a personal data breach, as required by [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR").

The notification concerned a security incident, whereby information from a database was illegally accessed. Such access to the information resulted from a vulnerability of one of the employee’s servers.

The personal data of the data subject concerned were: name, surname, telephone number, delivery address, belonging to a significant number of customers of the controller.

The DPA started an investigation, which revealed that the controller did not implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the required security level.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, as per [Article 32(1) and (2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"), to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing stemming from by the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorised access to the personal data transmitted, stored and otherwise processed.

Moreover, such failure clashes with the principle of integrity and confidentiality laid out in [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR").

The DPA found a violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 32(1) and (2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). Thus, the DPA deemed it appropriate to impose a fine of RON 24,885 (€5,000).

Additionally, the DPA recommended the controller to inform the affected data subjects of the security incidents and to put into place the technical and organizational measures adopted in order to remedy to the breach.

Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in February 2025, an investigation at the operator Automobilus International S.R.L. and found a violation of art. 32 para. (1) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 24,885 Lei, equivalent to the amount of 5,000 Euros.

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator Automobilus International S.R.L. of a notification of a personal data breach, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Thus, the operator reported a security incident, namely that information from its database was illegally accessed by a third party and at the same time the confidentiality of some personal data was lost. It was also notified that access to the information in the records system held was obtained by exploiting a vulnerability in one of the operator's servers. 

During the investigation, it was found that the operator did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the processing risk generated in particular, accidentally or unlawfully, by the destruction, loss, modification, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to personal data transmitted, stored and otherwise processed, as it was obliged to do under art. 5 para. (1) letter f) of the GDPR. 

In this context, certain categories of personal data were illegally accessed, such as: name, surname, telephone number, delivery address, belonging to a significant number of the operator's clients. 

Thus, since no appropriate technical and organizational measures were taken to ensure an appropriate level of security, a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 was found, and the operator was fined.

At the same time, pursuant to art. 58 para. (2) letter d) of the Regulation, the corrective measure of informing the affected data subjects about the security incident, as well as about the technical and organizational measures adopted for the purpose of remediation by displaying a press release on the front page of the company's website, was ordered against the operator.
