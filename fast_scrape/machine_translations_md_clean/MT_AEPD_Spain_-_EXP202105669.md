## English Summary

### Facts

The Department of Education, Culture and Sports (the controller), specifically the General Directorate of Personnel Management, shared via email an Excel sheet with various departments, containing the name, surname, ID, and job position of more than 200 public employees (data subjects) without their consent. The sheet contained an additional cell to indicate if they wanted to carry out a medical examination, which seemed to not be related to the employment relationship. One of the data subjects filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA regarding this incident and claiming that he did not consent to dissemination of his personal data for the purposes of a medical examination.

During the proceedings initiated by the DPA, the controller submitted that the Excel sheet was sent to the corporate email accounts of each office of the controller's Deparment, which could only be accessed by senior level secretaries. The controller clarified that the data subject did not receive the sheet to his personal work email address but accessed it through the corporate account to which he was subscribed, just as the senior level secretaries. This meant that the controller did not massively disseminate the data of the Departments' employees, but instead asked the competent secretaries to obtain consent for the medical examination, assuming that only authorised persons would have access to the sheet. The controller also submitted that it ordered the persons responsible to review and bring the processing activities into compliance with the GDPR after the incident.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA confirmed that in the present case, there was a personal data breach categorised as a confidentiality breach since the data controller disclosed personal data to third parties, without their express consent. The DPA adopted a broad definition of 'security breach' as also including unlawful disclosure of personal data ([Article 4(12) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR")).

Next, the DPA held that the controller disseminated personal data of employees without prior consent in violation of the principle of confidentiality ([Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR")).

Furthermore, the DPA decided that the controller also infringed [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") due to lack of technical and organisational measures as well as lack of due diligence, which enabled the disclosure of personal data and access by unauthorised parties. This was illustrated by the fact that the controller was not aware of who, apart from the senior level secretaries, had access to the corporate email accounts. The DPA noted that the controller should have adopted measures proportionate to the security risks involved, such as pseudonymisation or encryption in order to ensure integrity and confidentiality of the personal data. The controller should have also conducted evaluations of the effectiveness of these measures.

The DPA ordered the controller, pursuant to [Article 58(2)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2d "Article 58 GDPR"), to adopt appropriate security measures within a month in order to ensure that the processing meets the requirements set forth in the [Articles 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and [32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"), preventing similar situations from occurring in the future.

## Comment

In its decision, the DPA made it clear that controller must have been aware of the risk to which the corporate email was exposed, since privileged access to the mailbox is usually restricted to several people from a determined area, so the actions of said accesses must be conveniently traced to detect any unusual situation, especially those that may lead to loss of confidentiality.

This is another decision by the Spanish DPA in which it treats the unlawful disclosure of personal data as a security breach, rather than unlawful processing under [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). A very similar approach was taken in decision [PS-00342-2022](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=AEPD_\(Spain\)_-_ps-00342-2022).

FIRST: It is on record that on November 8, 2021, the claimant
filed a claim with the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, since

                           FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                           Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/14

control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and
Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to

initiate and resolve this procedure, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions

regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

                                           II
In response to the allegations presented by the respondent entity, it should be noted

the next:

In the first place, the documentation in the file proves that the party
claimed, from the email address: \*\*\*EMAIL.1 sent an email
email to the SGT and General Directorates, in which an Excel sheet was attached
where you could see the name, surname, ID, job position of more than 200

public employees and an additional cell to indicate if they wished to carry out a
medical examination.

The defendant has alleged that the referral was made to the email accounts
corporate offices of each organization, which are attended solely by the
secretaries of senior positions in each of them. However, what

occurs in this case does not conform to said scheme, since the information relative to
the claimant is not only sent to his unit, but the complete list of
all departments with the name, surname, ID, job position of more than
200 public employees, was within the reach of all recipient departments
of said email. If minimum security measures have been established in the
sending the list, it could have been sent to each unit only the data of

personnel attached to each of them. However, the complete list was sent to
all. With this, even admitting the possibility that access to the corporate mailbox of
each general directorate was restricted, the truth is that they were revealed to all
units the personal data of personnel not attached to them. Also, the mail
email in question, in turn, drags below, the one that DG Personnel received for

the data collection was carried out. Well, neither one nor the other contain
indications of precautions addressed to recipients so that the collection of
data was collected with the utmost confidentiality, which points to a lack of measures
of security.

In this sense, although email is a communication tool

that facilitates and speeds up the operation of a company, despite its
great benefits such as accessibility, speed and the possibility of attaching files,
it is necessary to define a correct and safe use, since, in some
Sometimes, employees can send confidential documents to those who do not
They had to by mistake, or reveal personal data. In this sense it is very important
make staff and users of corporate mail aware of threats and

provide them with the appropriate tools to make safe use of it.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/14

In the specific case under review, in relation to the category of data to which
third parties have had access, on the possibility of combining information
referring to a holder of personal data, the Opinion can be brought up
4/2007 of the Working Group of Article 29, "On the concept of personal data"
that analyzes the possibilities of identifying someone through combinations with

other information, starting only from the basic data and combining it with
other.

Specifically, it indicates the following: (...) when we speak of "indirectly"
identified or identifiable, we are referring in general to the phenomenon of
"unique combinations", be they small or large. In cases where, to

At first glance, the available identifiers do not make it possible to single out a person
given, it may still be "identifiable" because that combined information
with other data (whether the controller is aware of them
as if not) will allow distinguishing that person from others. This is where the Directive
refers to "one or several specific elements, characteristic of their physical identity,

physiological, psychological, economic, cultural or social. Some of those features
are so unique that they allow you to identify a person without effort (the "current
President of the Government of Spain"), but a combination of details
belonging to different categories (age, regional origin, etc.) can also be what
quite conclusive in some circumstances, especially if you have access to
additional information of a certain type. This phenomenon has been studied

widely by statisticians, always ready to avoid any
breach of confidentiality (…). So the different pieces come together.
that make up the personality of the individual in order to attribute certain
decisions. (…)

In this case, the Internet search, for example, of the name, surname of one of the

those affected can offer results that combining them with those now accessed
by third parties, allow us access to other applications of those affected or the
creation of personality profiles, which need not have been consented to by
its owner.

This possibility supposes an added risk that has to be assessed and that increases the

requirement of the degree of protection in relation to the safety and safeguarding of the
integrity and confidentiality of these data.

This risk must be taken into account by the data controller who, in
function of this, must establish the necessary technical and organizational measures that
prevents the data controller from losing control of the data and,

therefore, by the owners of the data that provided them.

Consequently, the allegations must be dismissed, meaning that the
arguments presented do not distort the essential content of the offense that
is declared committed nor does it imply sufficient justification or exculpation.

                                           II
                                  previous questions

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/14

The Department of Education, Culture and Sport of the Government of Aragon, like any other
any other public entity, is obliged to comply with Regulation (EU)
2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016, regarding the

protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data
and the free circulation of these data -RGPD-, and LO 3/2018, of December 5,
bre, Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights -LO-
PDGDD- regarding the processing of personal data that they carry out,
understanding by personal data, "all information about a natural person
identified or identifiable.

An identifiable natural person is considered to be one whose identity can be determined,
directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as a
name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or

one or several elements proper to physical, physiological, genetic, psychological,
economic, cultural or social of said person.

Likewise, treatment must be understood as “any operation or set of operations

tions made on personal data or sets of personal data, either by
automated procedures or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structure
ration, conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, co-
communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form of access authorization,
collation or interconnection, limitation, suppression or destruction”.

Taking into account the foregoing, the Department of Education, Culture and Sport pre-
ta a series of public services, for which it processes personal data of
its employees and citizens.

It carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, since it is
who determines the purposes and means of such activity, by virtue of article 4.7 of the GDPR:

"responsible for the treatment" or "responsible": the natural or legal person, authority
public authority, service or other body that, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and
means of treatment; if the law of the Union or of the Member States determines
determines the purposes and means of the treatment, the person in charge of the treatment or the criteria

Specific reasons for their appointment may be established by the Law of the Union or of the
Member states.
Article 4 section 12 of the RGPD defines, in a broad way, the "violations of security"

security of personal data" (hereinafter security breach) as "all
those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or alteration
Accidental or illegal transfer of personal data transmitted, stored or processed in
otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to such data.”

In the present case, there is a personal data security breach in the
circumstances indicated above, categorized as a breach of confidentiality,
whenever the claimed party has disclosed information and data of a personal nature

to third parties, without the express consent of the owner of said data, by attaching to the
e-mail an Excel sheet containing the name, surname, ID, position of
work of more than 200 public employees and an additional cell to indicate if
They wanted to do the medical examination.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/14

This type of data, as well as any other information that is referred to
individuals, are considered personal data, so their
Treatment is subject to data protection regulations.

According to GT29, a "Breach of confidentiality" occurs when there is

an unauthorized or accidental disclosure of personal data, or access to it
themselves.

It should be noted that the identification of a security breach does not imply the impossibility
sanction directly by this Agency, since it is necessary to analyze the

diligence of managers and managers and security measures applied.
Within the principles of treatment provided for in article 5 of the GDPR, the
integrity and confidentiality of personal data is guaranteed in section 1.f)

of article 5 of the GDPR. For its part, the security of personal data comes
regulated in article 32 of the GDPR, which regulates the security of the treatment.

                                           IV.

                                Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR

Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR establishes the following:

"Article 5 Principles relating to treatment:

1. Personal data will be:

(…)

f) processed in such a way as to guarantee adequate data security
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures

or organizational procedures (“integrity and confidentiality”).”

In relation to this principle, Recital 39 of the aforementioned GDPR states that:

“\[…\]Personal data must be processed in a way that guarantees security and
appropriate confidentiality of personal data, including to prevent access

or unauthorized use of said data and of the equipment used in the treatment”.

The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the
claimed violated article 5.1 f) of the GDPR, principles relating to treatment.

In the present case, according to documentation provided by the claimant and in the absence of
response of the claimed party, it can be verified that, from the direction of
email: \*\*\*EMAIL.1 An email has been sent containing the
attached an Excel sheet in which you can see the name, surname, ID,
workplace for more than 200 public employees and an additional cell for

indicate if they wished to undergo a medical examination.

The accredited facts constitute, on the part of the defendant, in his capacity as
responsible for the aforementioned processing of personal data, a violation of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/14

principle of confidentiality, by disseminating this information among employees without
certify that he had obtained their consent for that specific
treatment.

Consequently, it is considered that the accredited facts are constitutive of
infringement, attributable to the claimed party, due to violation of article 5.1.f) of the
GDPR.

                                           V
                Classification of the infringement of article 5.1.f) of the GDPR

The aforementioned infringement of article 5.1.f) of the GDPR supposes the commission of the infringements
typified in article 83.5 of the GDPR that under the heading "General conditions
for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

       a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

       consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infractions" establishes that
"The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 "Infractions considered very
serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"one. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

       a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees

           established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

                                          SAW
Article 32 of the GDPR, security of treatment, establishes the following:

 "one. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the

nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which may include, among others:

       a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/14

       b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data

       quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       technical and organizational measures to guarantee the safety of the
       treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to

take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data
personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct pursuant to article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
present article.

4. The controller and the processor shall take measures to ensure that

any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor and
have access to personal data can only process such data by following
instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Law of
the Union or of the Member States.

The facts revealed imply the lack of technical measures and
organizational by enabling the display of personal data of the claimant
with the consequent lack of diligence by the person in charge, allowing unauthorized access
authorized by third parties.

It should be noted that the GDPR in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of the
security measures that are applicable according to the data that is the object
of treatment, but it establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment
apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk involved
the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, the
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, probability risks

and severity for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

In addition, security measures must be adequate and proportionate to the
detected risk, noting that the determination of the technical measures and
organizational procedures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and encryption, the

ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience, the
ability to restore availability and access to data after an incident, process
verification (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the
measures.

In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the security level,
particular account of the risks presented by data processing, such as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data
personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/14

unauthorized access to said data and that could cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

In this sense, recital 83 of the GDPR states that:

       "(83) In order to maintain security and prevent processing from infringing what
provided in this Regulation, the person in charge or in charge must evaluate
the risks inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as the
encryption. These measures must ensure an adequate level of security, including the

confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application
regarding the risks and nature of the personal data to be
protect yourself. When assessing risk in relation to data security, considerations should be
