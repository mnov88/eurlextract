## English Summary

### Facts

In this case Proximus had failed to grant a woman's right of erasure of her personal data and had passed the data on to other telephone directories and directory enquiry services even after receiving several complaints and correspondence from the data subject. On request of the data subject, Proximus had changed the code linked to the data subject's data from 'visible' to 'confidential'. After adjusting the code regarding publication, Proximus received new contact details of the person concerned from her operator, as a result of which the data in the underlying database was automatically overwritten with the new data from the operator.

The Belgian DPA imposed a fine of €20,000 on the defendant defendant for infringement of Articles 6, 7 and 12 of the GDPR. In the contested decision, the Belgian DPA found the infringement of Article 6, 7, 12, 13 and 24 GDPR sufficiently proven.

In addition, the DPA ordered the defendant to cease any further disclosure of personal data of subscribers to third parties of telephone directory or inquiry services when Proximus acquired these data only as a provider of telephone directories and directory enquiry services, taking into account a transition period in order to give Proximus (and the telecommunications sector in a broader context) the opportunity to develop a new privacy compliant system.

### Holding

With regard to the question of whether consent is required to be included in telephone directories or not and what scope of this consent is, the Court of Appeal also considered that:

1° In situations where the e-Privacy Directive specifies the rules laid down in the GDPR, these specific provisions of the e-Privacy Directive as _lex specialis_ prevail over the more general provisions of the GDPR. (principle of _Lex specialis derogate legi generali)_

2° Article 12(1) and recital 38 of the ePrivacy Directive refer to the requirement of informed consent within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EG of subscribers for being included in public directories. Following article 94 GDPR that states that all references to 95/46/EG should be considered as references to GDPR, the abovementioned articles thus refer to ‘consent’ in the light of GDPR and thus the condition for a valid consent (Article 7 GDPR) must be met.

3° This consent relates to the purpose of publication of the personal data in the directories, but not to the identity of the directory provider. Consequently, the court states that the consent given will also be valid for subsequent processing of the personal data by other directory providers, provided that this processing serves the same purpose

Given the fact that this is a complex matter which raises some questions that are not yet tackled by the legislator, the Brussels Court of Appeal stayed the proceedings to request the Court of Justice for a **preliminary ruling regarding** following questions:

1° Should Article 72.2 of the e-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC, read in conjunction with Article 2(f) of that directive and with Article 95 of the General Data Protection Regulation to be interpreted as allowing a national supervisory to be interpreted as permitting a national supervisory authority to require the 'consent' of a subscriber within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation as the basis for the publication of the subscriber's personal data in public directories and directory enquiry services, both those published by the operator itself and by thirdproviders, providers, in the absence of national legislation to the contrary?

2° Should the right of erasure contained in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation be interpreted as precluding a national supervisory authority from considering a request by an individual for removalfrom public directories and directory enquiry services as a request for erasure within the meaning of Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation?

3° Must Article 24 and Article 5(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation be interpreted as precluding a national supervisory authority from concluding from the accountability obligation contained therein that the controller must take appropriate technical and organisational measures to inform third-party controllers, namely the telephone service provider and, inter alia, providers of telephone directories and directory enquiry services who have received data from that controller, of any withdrawal of consent by the data subject in accordance with Article 6 juncto Article 7 of the Regulation?

4° Must Article 17.2 of the General Data Protection Regulation be interpreted as precluding a national supervisory authority from ordering a provider of public directories and directory enquiry services who is requested to cease disclosing data relating to an individual to take reasonable steps to inform search engines of that request for deletion of data?

These operatorsprovide such contact details regularly to Proximus, as the provider of theProximus Gids, except for the contact details of subscribers who have expressed their wishto not be mentioned in the Proximus Guides.There are other telephone directories, such as the White Pages (wltteeids.be), infobel.be, del212.be,opendi.be etc. These guides (hereinafter the Third Guides) are published by third parties ,In accordance with an agreement with FCR Media, the publisher of the White Pages (and Gouden Gids),send Proximus contact information of subscribers in the Proximus Guides appearto FCR Media.In the databases of the Proximus Guides and Third Guides is there a distinctionmade between subscribers who are allowed to appear in a telephone directory , and subscribers who are not ina telephone wishing to appear too. In practice, this distinction is translated into onecode in the record for a subscriber: "NNNNN" for the first category (contact informationmay appear) and "XXXXX" for the second category (contact details remain secret).On 13 January 2019 had a person (the complainant in the context of the procedure for theDisputes Chamber of the Data Protection Authority) via the website contact form at1207, be the following request : "\[...\] Please do not include this telephone number in the White Pages,at 7207,be, ...

Ratio temporis has been de since 25 May 2018AVG is the legal successor of Directive 95/46/EC.Article 95 and Recital 173 of the GDPR confirm the lex generalis-lex specialis relationshipbetween the AVG and the e-Privacy Directive, which in Article 95 states to the AVG naturalpersons or entities Horticultural aanvullende.Jgrplichtínsen oqleqt with regard toprocessing in connection with the provision of publicly available electroniccommunication services in public communication networks in the EU, to the extent that they areunder the ePrivacy Directive are subject to specific obligations with the sameobjective.Some provisions of the ePrivacy Directive "specify" the provisions of the GDPR withrelating to the processing of personal data in the electronic sectorcommunication.

It is the publication itself vonpersonal data in a telephone directory that has a special purpose , whichharm may prove to be for a subscriber. When the subscriber has consentedin the publication of its data in a telephone directory that has a special purposeis, will he , however, about the general interest not to have them to resistagainst the publication of the same data in another comparable telephone directory.63 In the second affirms paragraph 39 of the preamble to the Directive that the transmissionvdn personal von obonnees oan third parties permitted is when daaroan ,, thefor in word \[is\] connected dot the data not for other purposes \[. ,,\]are used other than that word for which they are collected".64 Thirdly , the Directive on privacy and electronic communications mentions acase where in renewed or specific consent von the obonnee can beto provide.

Brussels Court of Appeal - 2020/ AR/L160 - p, 212. Withdrawal of consentIt is above inadequate disputed or disputable that no specific legislation has beenelaborated with regard to the withdrawal of that expression of will or 'consent' by a subscriber,neither in the e-Privacy Directive, nor in the WEC, nor in an implementing decree. Does this meanthen automatically that all provisions of the GDPR apply in full, also inthis particular context of telephone directories with the consequences as below furtherindicated ?3. CompetitionProximus states that if the GDPR conditions on consent apply, thereno new providers can enter the market in practice, while the ratio legisthe e-Privacy Directive precisely the liberalization of the market, and there was also claimedProximus an incompatibility has arisen between the GDPR and certain articles of the WEC.The GBA disputes this claim and argues that the application of the GDPR to the furthertransfer of data by providers of directories and directory inquiry servicesdoes not create a competitive disadvantage for other (including new) suppliers ofsimilar services, provided that they provide the necessary subscriber data, pursuant to the Articles45, 5 2, ên 46, S 2, WEC, directly from the telephone service providers, andthis without the re-authorization of the subscriber must be obtained. Theeffective competition on the market for telephone directories andtelephone inquiry services are therefore guaranteed according to the GBA .The Marktenhof notes on which the GBA is authorized to AVG to maintain and theBelgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications (BIPT) as referred to in Article 13of the Law of 17 January 2003 with regard to the status of the regulator of theThe Belgian postal and telecommunications sector is in principle competent for the enforcement ofthe ePrivacy Directive and has not taken a recent position on the matter. The claim of theGBA that effective competition is guaranteed, lijkl primo focie not conclusiveproved to be.4. Wos the republishing an unlawful processing of personal data ?As already explained in the statement of facts, was the underlying database of Proximusa few days after the first adjustment of the 'paramete/about publication automaticallyoverwritten by the telephone service provider / operator of the complainant, namely Telenet.As a result of this transfer, the complainant 's personal data were -also automatically - published in the public telephone directories and information servicesthat Proximus offers. Proximus , in its third sub-appeal, argues that the republication ofthe personal data after the withdrawal of the consent by the complainant is not unlawfulused to be. Proximus will have thereby assumed that the information which thetelephone service provider/operator must always take precedence over its own subscribersl-pler 0I-0800r,1ïgegê-00ar,-00es-0r-0r-;-lL ffiJ
Page 23
Court of Appeal Brussels\*2020/ARlt160 - p. 22on the information that providers of directories and directory inquiry services directlyreceived from those subscribers. Proximus believes this argument to be able to rely on Article133, 5 1, paragraph 3, WEC, that the responsibility to give consent to a subscriberquestions for the publication of his personal data to the operator .According to the GBA and since neither the WEC nor an implementing decree (nor in Article in12 of the e-Privacy Directive), a specific regulation has been elaborated on thatcorrections and deletions, such a request must be made in accordance with Article 16 GDPR (for (improvements) or Article 17 GDPR (for deletions) can be addressed to étLgyerwerkinesverantwoordeliike within the meaning of the AVG - and therefore also to any provider of atelephone directory or directory inquiry service.The Marktenhof wonders, however , now that it clearly appears from the text of the WEC that theoperator plays the main role in the relationship with the subscriber, not the provider of a telephonedirectory or directory inquiry service, or legally allowed for the provider to thepersonal data received from the operator over the personal data in its owndatabase to be trusted. A different view would possibly conflict are with the letterand the spirit of art. L2, paragraph 2 e-Privacy Directive and art. 133, $1, paragraph 2 to paragraph 4 WEC.5. If there is an obligation to pass on any request from a data subject to the source ofthe personal data or third parties including recipients ?Proximus argues in its fourth sub-ground that the controller under theAVG only the recipients of personal data in knowledge must draw from certainrequests of stakeholders, but not the person or organization which the data hasprovided.The GBA tries to find a legal basis for this in the general obligation in art, 24AVG to "appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to waor secure and tocan show that the processing is carried out in accordance with \[the GDPR\] ".According to the GBA , this amounts to a "one-stop shop" mechanism for the withdrawal of"permission":"Wonneer there several distinguished its controllers, which each of themprocessing perform the same permission as basis have a permissionthat the data subject has with one or more of those data controller(s)given is sufficient dot the person concerned for the withdrawal of that consentpointing to one of the controllers to processing on the basis of the von by thedata subject carries out given consent. In which sense, in Article 24 (in this case togetherconsidered with Article 6 and ortikel 7) AVG a principle of a single window to read,where the person concerned himself enkeltot one controller serves to establish "(para. 81 of the contested decision).Moreover, states the GBA explicitly to this , the result is that thecontroller to whom the subject is focused, "the necessary technical andorganizational moat takes control, in order to ensure dot the person himselfl-paer 0r,-0000J,ïqsesê-00ee-00es-0r-0r-i'llffi ErffiËJ
