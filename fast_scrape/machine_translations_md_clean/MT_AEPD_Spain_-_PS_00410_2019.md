## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant does not comply with its information duties in relation to the cookies used at one of its websites.

### Dispute

The defendant did not answer to any AEPD investigation requests, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure. During its investigations, the AEPD discovered that (i) on the basic layer of the website, there is no banner informing on the use of cookies, although both cookies by the defendant and by third parties are automatically installed, that (ii) on the detailed layer of the website, there is a Cookies Policy providing generic information, but there is no way to manage such cookies by the user.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed its information duties in relation to cookies as per Article 22(2) LSSI, according to which, digital services providers may use data storage and retrieval devices on computers terminals of the recipients, provided that such recipients have given their consent after they have been provided with clear and complete information on their use and, in particular, on the purposes of data processing according to the data protection laws. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) the existence of intentionality, and (ii) the period of time the defendant has been infringing its duties taking into account that the claim is dated September 2018\], the AEPD decided to impose a fine of 3,000 € to the defendant. Additionally, the AEPD requires the defendant to correct the situation on the cookies use at the website in the period of one (1) month since this resolution.
