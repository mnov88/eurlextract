                                 BACKGROUND

FIRST: On February 18, 2021, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against VODAFONE

SPAIN, S.A.U. (hereinafter, the claimed), through the Agreement that is transcribed:

<<

Procedure Nº: PS / 00484/2020

           AGREEMENT TO START THE SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and in

based on the following:

                                     ACTS

FIRST: Mrs. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant) dated November 10,

2020 filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against VODAFONE ESPAÑA, S.A.U. with NIF A80907397 (as
successive, the claimed).

The reasons on which the claim is based are the following:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/13

"After several complaints to you (last resolution with reference number
E / 01699/2019) in which they urged VODAFONE to permanently delete and, after the

which, VODAFONE sent me a letter by certificate and a new confirmation by
email of having proceeded, after an incident, to solve it, I continue to receive SMS

initially accused more than a year ago and I no longer know what to do ... not only
for continuing without the guarantee that my data will be permanently deleted, if not, because
They are SMS in which it is indicated that an invoice is generated in my name and, although

reassure that I have nothing pending, I have no guarantee that this way
It is ... I beg you to take action on your part so that these

SMS. "

And, among other things, it provides the following documentation:

 - Letter from the complained party, dated March 24, 2020 and sent within the framework of the
file E / 01520/2020, in which you are informed that your phone was assigned

incorrectly to another customer, hence the SMS notices I was receiving.
They proceed to correct the incident, and guarantee that you will no longer receive any SMS

plus.

 - Attach two screenshots of your mobile phone, where two notices are displayed,

submitted on May 11 and November 9, 2020.

- Emails addressed to the address \*\*\* EMAIL.1 from temalegales@vodafone.es,

on the facts that are the object of this claim.

SECOND: As background to the present sanctioning procedure, it is necessary to

manifest:

1.- The claimant was a client of the defendant years ago. He stated that he received SMS

of the entity notifying about invoices for services not contracted, so it put the
facts made known to the entity requesting clarification and requesting the deletion

of his data and, despite receiving a positive response, he continued to receive the same
SMS. It provided documentation.

2.- The claims filed with this Agency by the claimant were transferred
dated January 9 and May 23, 2019 to the one claimed, giving rise to the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/13

files E / 01699/2019 and E / 06311/2019. This Agency proceeded to

file of the claims for having been attended to them, and therefore the
problems solved.

3.- In a new claim dated November 9, 2019, it stated the
claimant who continued to receive SMS dated October 9, 2020, provided the SMS,

resulted in E / 11566/2019. It was inadmissible for having sent the claimed letter dated
October 30, 2019 to the claimant indicating that the incident was resolved, not
consisting of SMS after said communication.

4.- Thus, in another claim dated December 23, 2019, provide SMS
of December 13, 2019 for which it is transferred to the DPD, giving rise to the

E / 01520/2020. We proceeded to file, since the entity stated that the number
The phone number was associated with another customer and that the incident had been resolved.

5.- Well, the claimant contributes new SMS sent to the mobile, she has received again
two notices on the mobile phone, sent on May 11 and November 9 of the year

2020, showing that the event continues to occur.

                                FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                                  I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                                 II

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/13

       The claimed facts are specified in the treatment of the data of the

claimant by the claimed without standing to do so, by sending
SMS to your mobile phone informing you of the generation of invoices in your name and
subsequent emails to your personal Gmail account clarifying the

circumstances in which these SMS shipments have occurred.

       Said treatment could be constitutive of an infringement of article 6, Lawfulness
of the treatment, of the RGPD that establishes that:

       "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

       a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;

       b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
pre-contractual;

       (…)

       In article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in its section 11, it states that:

       "11)" consent of the interested party ": any manifestation of free will,

specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through
a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that

they concern him ”.

       Also article 6, Treatment based on the consent of the affected party,

of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), states

what:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/13

        "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, the consent of the affected party is understood to be any manifestation of will

free, specific, informed and unequivocal for which it accepts, either through a
declaration or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that

concern.

        2. When the data processing is intended to be based on consent

of the affected party for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to record in a
specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.

        3. The execution of the contract may not be subject to the consent of the affected party
processing of personal data for purposes that are not related to the
maintenance, development or control of the contractual relationship ”.

        Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of "the principles
basic to the treatment, including the conditions for consent in accordance with

of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 ”is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the
mentioned Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of

€ 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, of an equivalent amount
at a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover for the financial year
above, opting for the one with the highest amount ”.

        On the other hand, the LOPDGDD for the purposes of prescription states in its article 72:
"Violations considered very serious:

        1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that

suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/13

        b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation

(EU) 2016/679.

        (…) "

                                                III

        The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the
claimed violated article 6 of the RGPD, since it processed the

personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so,
materialized in that you continue to receive SMS sent to your mobile phone related to
billing, even though you have requested in the past the deletion of your data and the

claimed, guaranteed that similar notices would no longer be received, within the framework of
various claims that he filed with this Agency.

        It is important to highlight that this Agency transferred the
claims made by the claimant to the respondent giving rise to the

files E / 01699/2019, E / 06311/2019, E / 11566/2019 and E / 01520/2020. In all
They stated that the incident was already resolved.

        Thus it appears that, in the framework of file E / 01520/2020, which has led to the
present sanctioning procedure, the claimant provided a response from the claimed
dated March 24, 2020, in which it stated:

        “Through this letter, we want to inform you that we have returned to
review your case, since the incident was already resolved, as you were informed by the

last April 5, 2019.

        On this occasion, we have noticed that his mobile number was associated with
to another Vodafone customer as a contact number, hence the receipt from you

of SMS.

        We inform you that this incident has already been resolved, so that
you will not receive any more notices of invoice availability. "

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/13

        Despite all the above, the claimant continued to receive SMS sent to her
mobile for the claimed. As evidenced by the two screenshots provided by that

of your mobile phone, where two notices are displayed, sent on May 11 and
November 2020 by Vodafone.

        Consequently, it has carried out a processing of personal data without
has proven that it has the legal authorization to do so.

                                                IV
