## English Summary

### Facts

On 22 October 2021, a data subject visited a website operated by the American company Briggs & Stratton LLC (the controller) and accepted cookies via a cookie banner showing only the options “accept all cookies” or “cookie settings”. As a consequence, unique IDs that allow for identification of the data subject had been saved on the controller’s server and were then transmitted to the servers of third party providers, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft. The complainant held the cookie banner to be unlawful and requested the controller to stop processing and delete all his personal data and to inform the third party providers thereof. However, the controller never provided information regarding the erasure of the personal data apart from stating that it does not save any data on its own servers, but it makes use of Adobe Analytics. The controller also failed to provide an answer on whether third party providers had been informed about the complainant's request for erasure of his personal data.

The data subject, represented in the proceedings by _noyb_ – European Centre for Digital Rights, thus filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA to have his right to erasure according to [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") enforced, as well as to order the controller to suspend all processing activities of his personal data and to inform third party providers of the erasure of the personal data transmitted to them by virtue of [Article 19 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_19_GDPR "Article 19 GDPR").

In the meantime, the controller adjusted the cookie banner displayed on its website, however, the complainant claimed that it still failed to meet GDPR requirements as it proved more burdensome to withdraw one’s consent than to grant it.

### Holding

As regards the cookie banner displayed on the controller’s website on 22 October 2021, the Austrian DPA held that given the absence of a “reject” option that cookie banner constituted a violation of [Article 7(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#3 "Article 7 GDPR") and it also failed to comply with the requirements set out in [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 25(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#1 "Article 25 GDPR"). Accordingly, the DPA held that there could be no valid consent according to [Article 7 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR "Article 7 GDPR") and [Article 4(11) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#11 "Article 4 GDPR").

On this basis, the DPA declared the processing of personal data of the complainant by the controller to be unlawful and it ordered the controller to delete his personal data (id and id-number) by virtue of [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") and to communicate this to the third party providers to whom this data had been disclosed upon visiting the controller’s website (in particular Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Adobe), according to [Article 19 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_19_GDPR "Article 19 GDPR"), within 4 weeks from adoption of this decision. In this, the DPA held that it is irrelevant whether the controller saves the personal data relating to the complainant on its own servers or on an external server such as Adobe Analytics.

With respect to the current cookie banner showing on the controller’s webpage, the DPA held that the fact that it still takes more steps to withdraw than to give one’s consent to the cookie settings constitutes a violation of [Article 7(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#3 "Article 7 GDPR"). In light of this, the DPA ordered the controller to adapt the cookie banner displayed on its website so that it complies with GDPR requirements within 8 weeks from the decision.
