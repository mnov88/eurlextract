## English Summary

### Facts

A personal data breach has been notified by the HSE to the DPC on 1 May 2019. The personal data breach occurred when a member of the public found documentation that contained the personal data of 15 data subjects, including data relating to clinical information and treatments received. The documents were created in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, but were discovered by a member of the public in their front garden.

### Dispute

### Holding

The decision found that the HSE infringed Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the GDPR by failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented by its use and disposal of hardcopy documents containing patientsâ€™ personal data.

## Comment

This decision should be read in conjunction with the decision (IN-19-9-1): they concern the same processing operations, undertaken by the same controller, and concern the same time period.
