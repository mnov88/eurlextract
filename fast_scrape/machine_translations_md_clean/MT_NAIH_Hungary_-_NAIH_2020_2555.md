According to the Applicant's statement, the subscriber of the telephone number \[…\] is not the Applicant, but \[..\], but the Applicant is the user of this telephone number.

 

Pursuant to Article 2 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Regulation covers data management and data processing that concerns the data of a natural person.

 

CLXXIX of 2011 on the rights of nationalities. Pursuant to Section 2 (2) of the Act \[…\], an organization with legal personality, ie a non-natural person, can be directly identified on the basis of the telephone number connected to its subscription contract .

 

However, given that the telephone number subscribed by the legal entity can be linked to the Applicant as a user as a representative, it can be contacted directly when making and receiving a call or, in this case, using the telephone number and clearly contacting the Applicant. , so his personal data can be considered under Article 4 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation .

The data controller's measures must promote the principle of accuracy and prevent the use of inaccurate data. 

 

In view of the above , the recording of the telephone number used by the Applicant as the telephone number of the Debtor's customer and the sending of SMS addressed to the Customer to the Applicant's telephone number was not lawful under Article 5 (1) (d) of the General Data Protection Regulation. when his data was recorded, his colleague knew that the telephone number he recorded was not his customer and the customer was not the source of the data. The Authority established from the statements of the Applicant and the Debtor that the Applicant's telephone number was recorded as the data of the Debtor's client without the Applicant being entitled to act on behalf of the Debtor's client, as he did not have a power of attorney enabling the Applicant to act .

In the zone, despite the invitation of the Authority, the Debtor did not provide the Authority with any audio material or document supporting the existence of the consent. Thus, compliance with the requirements set out in recital 32 and Article 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation has not been demonstrated for the period up to the deletion.

 

Based on the above, the Authority concluded that the Debtor did not prove that he had the consent of the Applicant to process his personal data , so that the consent recorded the telephone number in his system in the absence of a legal basis, in breach of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

During the proceedings, the Debtor stated that he was not in a position to identify the Applicant in his register, so that he complied with his request for cancellation only after the additional information enabling his identification was communicated on 7 March 2019. Given that the Debtor, in violation of the principle of accuracy, recorded the telephone number used by the Applicant with his client, he could not fulfill the Applicant's request for cancellation without providing additional information, as he could not identify him. After providing the additional information , the Debtor deleted the personal data from its records.

 

Due to the above, the Debtor did not violate Article 15 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as he did not treat the telephone number data provided for contact purposes as personal data concerning the Applicant, however, the - III.2. In view of the findings made in point - the Debtor should have noticed that it was not the data of his client, but the data of a person who did not come into contact with the Debtor as a donor.

 

The Debtor complied with Article 11 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and deleted the inaccurate data from its records.

 

III.5. The phone application to be ordered cancellation of em

 

In the part of the application requesting the deletion of the telephone number, the Authority Pursuant to Section 47 (1) (c), the proceedings shall be terminated as the proceedings have become devoid of purpose, and the Debtor shall no longer continue the processing of the objected data.

III.6. Unlawful handling of applicant's address and e-mail address data

 

According to the Debtor's statement, only the telephone number \[…\] was recorded in the register of the Applicant's personal data.

 

From the Applicant's statement and the attached screenshots and correspondence with the Debtor - by electronic means only - the Authority found that the Debtor unlawfully processed only the Applicant's telephone number data, as it did not address the Payment Request to the Applicant, but to the previously notified address. customers. This is also supported by the Applicant's statement that the Applicant's husband received the letter addressed to the Debtor's client and made a "brother-in-law" note on the receipt, and indicated that the Debtor's client lives abroad as a way of life . It can be stated from the statements of the Debtor and the Applicant, as well as from the screenshots supporting the Applicant's claims, that the Debtor subsequently sent a notification about the debt of its client only by SMS to the Applicant .

 

According to the attached documents, the Debtor only sent reply letters to the Applicant's e-mail address to the Applicant's e-mail address.

 

Based on the above, the Authority concluded that the Applicant's address details and e-mail address were not unlawfully handled by the Debtor.

 

III.7. sanctions
