## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject realised that their neighbour (controller) installed surveillance cameras that were monitoring their private garden. They considered that the monitoring was violating the Spanish data protection law (Art.22 LOPDGDD) in force.

The data subject therefore filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA recalled that image of a person, according to [article 4.1 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR"), is a personal data and its protection is, therefore, subject of this Regulation. The concept of "processing" of personal data is defined in Article 4.2 of the GDPR. Article 22 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish national data protection law: Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos Personales y Garantía de los Derechos Digitales BOE-A-2018-11673) sets out the specific rules for the processing of data for video surveillance purposes and stating that natural or legal persons, may carry out the processing of images through camera or video camera systems for the purpose of preserving the security of persons and property, as well as of their installations. However, images may only be captured from the public insofar as it is essential for these security reasons.

Against this background the DPA holds that Video cameras may not capture images of persons who are outside the private space where the video surveillance system is installed, since the processing of images in public places can only be carried out by the Security Forces and Corps.

In the prersent case, the DPA found that there were no security reasons that justified the monitoring of a private garden.
