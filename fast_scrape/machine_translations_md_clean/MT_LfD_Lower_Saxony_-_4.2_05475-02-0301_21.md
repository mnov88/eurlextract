## English Summary

### Facts

In 2021 the controller, a media outlet, changed the cookie-banner on its website. The new website implementation gave the user alternatively the option to consent to the processing of personal data for the purpose of personalised advertising or to buy a subscription which enabled the use of the controller’s website without trackers and external advertisements.

Several complaints to the DPA for Niedersachsen followed, including one where the data subject was supported by the NGO noyb.

In 2023, the controller changed the cookie-banner.

### Holding

The DPA investigation led to the conclusion that not strictly necessary cookies were installed on the user’s device even before the latter actually interacted with the cookie-banner. Under the GDPR, previous consent by the data subject was required. In automatically installing cookies and other non-necessary technologies before any user’s interaction with the cookie banner, the controller violated [Article 6(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a "Article 6 GDPR").

The DPA also stated that in the first layer of the cookie-banner at least the following pieces of information should be clearly stated for the consent to be validly given:

*   concrete purposes of the processing,
*   information that that personal data were matched with data from other sources in order to profile the data subject,
*   information that personal data were shared outside the EEA,
*   the number of other controllers to which data are disclosed.

The DPA stressed how these pieces of information were either completely absent from the first layer or located below the “accept button”, i.e. in a place that the data subject would have looked at after having given their consent.

Another problematic point was that it was not clear whether the explanations provided in the first layer referred to the subscription option, the option with trackers or both. The DPA also held that the use of the word “accept” instead of “consent” did not give the data subject the impression that they had a free choice.

Furthermore, consent was not specific which is a direct consequence of the lack of information regarding the data processing. A blank consent, as implemented on the website, is not valid.

Concerning the lawfulness of the so-called pay-or-okay model, the supervisory authority referred to the criteria of the Conference of German Data Protection Authorities (DSK), which stated that the approach as such does not violate the GDPR as long as subscribers and users are offered a similar or the same service if they wish to pay.

On the surface, this seemed to be the case with the present controller. However, a closer look showed that the “accept option” entailed consent not only to advertising trackers but also to personalized content, products development and others. The DPA referred to the [EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on Consent under Regulation 2016/679](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf), according to which consent must be “granular”, i.e. it must be specific with regard to the single purposes and processing operations. In this case, users not willing to pay could not select purposes and processing operations, but had rather to provide a broad and unspecific consent. Such a consent was not valid.

The DPA also found that the withdrawal of consent was not an easy operation for the data subject.

In light of the above, the DPA issued a warning against the controller pursuant to [Article 58(2)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2b "Article 58 GDPR").

On the website www.heise.de, the processing of personal user data from persons who
were not registered as a pure subscriber on the website, in connection with the extensive

set of cookies, other tracking techniques and the integration of third-party services based on consent
in accordance with Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR. The requirements for effective consent in accordance with Article 4
No. 11 and Art. 7 DS-GVO were not available.

    • extent to which the consent was informed,
    • for the specific case,
    • clear affirmative action,
    • Voluntary consent, in particular no inadmissible influence on the user decision (so-called

    • withdrawal of consent,

It was not voluntary for a number of reasons. A declaration of intent is only given voluntarily
if no pressure or coercion is used to induce the data subject to consent.
Recital 42 GDPR explains that it should be assumed that the data subject
person then “has given their consent voluntarily if they have a real or free choice and are therefore in
able to refuse or withdraw consent without suffering detriment”.

In the EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679, paragraphs 13
and 14 executed on a voluntary basis:

        "\[13\] The element "free" implies that the individuals concerned have real choice and control
        have. In general, the GDPR stipulates that consent is not valid if the

        affected person has no real choice, feels pressured into consent or experiences negative effects
        must suffer if she does not consent. \[…\] Accordingly, consent is not considered
        considered voluntary if the data subject does not refuse or withdraw consent
        can without suffering any disadvantages. The GDPR also introduces the concept of “imbalance” between
        between the controller and the data subject.

In principle, the Pur subscribers and users of the website who give their consent receive the same
certain content is displayed on the website. The equivalence of the service is therefore given in principle.
However, no equivalence is to be assumed insofar as the consent is significantly more comprehensive than

it is presented to the user on the first level of the consent banner.
The first level of the consent banner suggested to the users that the Pur subscription was the
ad-free reading of www.heise.de (“without tracking, external banner and video advertising”) and

presented the alternative for reading www.heise.de with consent to advertising and tracking. The-

On the first level of the consent banner, the following purposes have been defined for "use with advertising

but purposes that have no direct connection to advertising, such as e.g. information

These purposes are summarized in the consent banners.

In addition to the equivalent alternative, the voluntary nature of the consent of non-subscribers requires that
granular consent can be given. In this regard, the EDPB takes the following legal view (cf.
EDPB, Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679, para. 43 f):

        “Recital 43 clarifies that consent is not considered freely given if
        the process/procedure for obtaining consent from data subjects does not allow
        separate consent to various processing operations of personal data

        to grant permission (i.e. only for some processing operations and not for others), although this is
        would be appropriate in the relevant case. Recital 32 states: 'Consent should

        attempts to obtain separate consents for each purpose lack freedom. This granularity - 14 -

        is closely related to the requirement that consent be given for the specific case. This
        is discussed below in Section 3.2.
        follows, the solution to compliance with the conditions for valid consent lies in the granule

tion can be explained in the consent banner. In search of the possibility of revocation, a
User first clicked on the "Cookies&Tracking" link. Since there is no "Consent revoked" button

call" found, finding the possibility of withdrawal was made more difficult for him and there is the assumption that
that many users have already given up their search at this point. Found in the consent banner
under the "Accept" button there is a note that "Consent" can be accessed at any time via the link
"Data protection" at the end of each page can be revoked. If the user gives his "consent" after the first
had given the website access once, he will presumably not have read this notice and

even if, by the time he has decided to withdraw, he has forgotten again. It
There is no way to directly reopen the consent banner on the first level. Independent
of the extent to which the user has previously (supposedly) consented, he can - 17 -

revoke all consents, but the button is not easy to find. The possibility of withdrawal
on the website therefore does not meet the requirements of Art. 7 Para. 3 Sentence 4 GDPR.
