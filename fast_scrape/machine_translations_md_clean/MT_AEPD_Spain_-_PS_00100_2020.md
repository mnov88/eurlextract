## English Summary

### Facts

On 03/10/19 AEPD received a complaint stating, inter alia, the following:

"The web page \*\*\*URL.1 does not comply with the current legislation on Data Protection as it does not have a Privacy Policy, nor a contact page, nor, even less, a Cookie Policy that complies with the aforementioned current legislation".

In view of the facts set out in the complaint and the documents provided by the complainant, AEPD proceeded to carry out actions for its clarification, specifically, to examine both the Privacy policy and the Cookie policy of the aforementioned web page.

Regarding the privacy policy, AEPD confirmed that the information found there was in line with the provisions of Article 13 GDPR, which governs the information that must be provided when personal data is collected directly from the data subject. Regarding the Cookie Policy, AEPD firstly checked the information contained therein (What are cookies - What do they use cookies for? - What data is obtained?- What are the cookies that are used?). It was also checked if there was any mechanism to reject all cookies, but none was found.

  

### Dispute

Were ARANOW PACKAGING MACHINERY's Privacy and Cookie policies aligned with European and national regulations ? (Art 13 GDPR and art 22.2 LSSI)

  

### Holding

With respect to the Privacy policy, AEPD considered that the Privacy Policy of the challenged website was not in contradiction with what is stipulated in article 13 of the GDPR. With regards to the Cookie policy, AEPD considered differently. The fact that there was no link to the different browsers to deactivate or delete cookies and the fact that there was no mechanism to reject all cookies was considered to be contrary to the legal provisions established in article 22.2 LSSI.

This Infraction is classified as "minor" in Article 38.4 g) of the aforementioned Law, and may be sanctioned with a fine of up to EUR 30,000 , in accordance with Article 39 of the LSSI. Two criteria (established in Article 40 of the LSSI) were applied to graduate the sanction: the existence of intentionality and the period of time during which the infraction was committed. Taking these criteria into account, the amount of the fine was calculated at EUR 3,000. However, two attenuating circumstances of the Spanish Law on Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (Article 85) could be applied, which may respectively reduce the fine by 20%. The first mitigating factor is to acknowledge their responsibility within the time allowed for the submission of claims. The second mitigating factor is, at any time prior to the resolution of the proceedings, to make voluntary payment of the proposed penalty.

On June 22, 2020, ARANOW PACKAGING MACHINERY, S.L proceeded to pay the sanction in the amount of EUR 1800, applying therefore the two previously mentioned reductions. This implied the recognition of their responsibility and the resignation to any action or appeal in administrative channels against the sanction. After these events, the AEPD decided to terminate the procedure.

## Comment

Despite the fact that the Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce has been introduced into the legal systems of the Member States in a harmonized manner, each Member State has its own administrative sanctioning procedures. This underlines the importance of knowing the administrative sanctioning procedures of each Member State, where small particularities can mean big differences from one State to another.
