## English Summary

### Facts

An ex-employee of the controller filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Authority, alleging that the company, for which they provided services, compelled them to utilize their personal cell phone for work purposes. This requirement involved installing an application, specifically a company wallet card platform.

Despite the complaints raised, the controller's response was adamant that they would not provide the employee with a company cell phone. Subsequently, the ex-employee mentioned that even after leaving the company, their phone number remained part of two WhatsApp groups. Consequently, they continued to receive messages from former colleagues, appearing in those groups as a former member, with their phone number and name still visible.

### Holding

The Spanish Data Protection Authority ruled that the processing activities conducted by the controller violated Article 6.1 of the GDPR. As a result, the DPA imposed a fine of €2,000 on the controller.

regulatory provisions dictated in its development and, as far as they are not

contradict, on a subsidiary basis, by the general rules on the
administrative procedures."

                                           II
       The reported events materialize in the inclusion in WhatsApp groups
without basis of legitimation, which could violate the regulations on protection

of personal data.

## Article 58 of the GDPR, Powers, states:

       "2. Each supervisory authority will have all of the following powers

corrective measures indicated below:

       (…)
       d) order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the operations of

       pursued by the person responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that
       The interests or rights and freedoms do not prevail over said interests.
       fundamentals of the interested party that require the protection of personal data,
       particularly when the interested party is a child.

       The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not apply to the

       Likewise, Recital 40 of the aforementioned GDPR provides that "In order for
processing is lawful, personal data must be processed with the
consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established in accordance
a Law, whether in this Regulation or under other Union law

or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation, including the
need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the data controller or the
need to execute a contract to which the interested party is a party or for the purpose of
take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a
contract."

       On the other hand, article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in sections 1, 2 and 11,
notes that:

       “1) “personal data”: any information about an identified natural person
or identifiable ("the interested party"); Any identifiable natural person will be considered

a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
concern him.”

                                           IV

       The infraction attributed to the defendant is classified in the
article 83.5 a) of the GDPR, which considers that the violation of “the basic principles
for processing, including the conditions for consent under the
articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned
article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of €20,000,000 as

maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount.”

       The LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infractions, states that: “They constitute
infractions the acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the

article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the
present organic law.”

       And in its article 72, it considers for the purposes of prescription, which are: “Infringements
considered very serious:

       1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
involve a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in
in particular, the following:

       (…)
       b) The processing of personal data without any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
       (…)”

                                           V
       The processing of personal data requires the existence of a database
legal that legitimizes it.

       In accordance with article 6.1 of the GDPR, in addition to consent,
There are other possible bases that legitimize the processing of data without the need for

execution of a contract to which the affected party is a party or for the application, at the request
of this, pre-contractual measures, or when necessary for the satisfaction of

legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by a third party,
provided that the interests or rights do not prevail over said interests and
fundamental freedoms of the affected party that require the protection of such data. He
Treatment is also considered lawful when it is necessary for the fulfillment of

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/12

a legal obligation applicable to the data controller, to protect interests
vital of the affected person or of another natural person or for the fulfillment of a mission
carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the

responsible for the treatment.

       The claimant in his writing of 05/28/2023 stated that the claimant is obliged
its workers to use their personal mobile phone to work (through the
Soldo application) and, furthermore, that having stopped providing services for the same
continues to be included in two WhatsApp groups, with the company refusing to delete the

themselves and forcing their employees to use their personal phones for work.

       The defendant in writing dated 09/13/2023 has stated that “To date,
They created WhatsApp groups to streamline the day-to-day life of the company, it was not a
mandatory requirement, but only verbal consent was requested, since 31

May 2023, written consent is requested from all workers.”

       Therefore, it is considered that the conduct of the defendant violates the principle of
legality enshrined in article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 a) of the
GDPR.

                                           SAW
