## English Summary

### Factsc

A complaint was submitted to the Spanish DPA about an alleged infringement of the GDPR. This case was filed under the case name EXP202209784.

In relation to the case, the Spanish DPA submitted two requests for information to the controller with a ten day deadline for compliance attached to each request.

The first one was sent on 21.03.2023 and received no reply. The second one was sent on 12.05.2023 and the controller acknowledged receipt.

Nonethless, the controller never sent the Spanish DPA the relevant requested information and for this reason the DPA began seperate sanctioning proceedings against the controller for the infringement of [Article 58(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR") (EXP202308002).

### Holding

The DPA fined the controller €500 for the infringement of [Article 58(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1 "Article 58 GDPR").

First, since the controller never cooperated with the DPA, the Spanish DPA considered the lack of information it received to breach [Article 58(1) GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR") It can be inferred that the controller breached [Article 58(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR") specifically as it did not provide the information the DPA required to allow it perform its tasks as a regulator.

Second, under [Article 83(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR") the fine imposed must be individual, effective, proportionate and disuasive. When calculting the fine for this controller, the DPA took into account that there was no publicly available information about the company's financial revenue when deciding the appropriate amount of the fine and came to conclusion that €500 would suffice.

Third, the DPA used its powers under [Article 58(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR") to order the controller to give to it within 10 working days (from the date of the decision) the relevant information it requires.
