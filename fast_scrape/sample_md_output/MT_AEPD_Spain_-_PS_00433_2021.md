## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against a tobacco shop in Tenerife called Island Meeting Puerto C.B. (the shop) for disseminating their image, as well as that of their partner, on social media networks Facebook and Instagram. The posted images were accompanied with comments by the shop accusing them of several robberies.

The comments attached to the images read as follows:

_"These two characters have been stealing from all tobacconists in the north. It never happens...Today it has happened to us again. We'll pay for data protection without problems._ _But it's okay that these people keep stealing and nothing happens. Where is the safe island where we lived in? Are we waiting for them to rob a bank? They have committed more than 20 robberies”_

The AEPD contacted the shop about these allegations and gave them a month to carry out actions to bring its practices into compliance with GDPR, as well as preventing this type of incident from reoccurring. However, no response to this communication was received.

### Holding

The AEPD considered that the shop violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") by disseminating the image of the claimant and their partner (accompanied by negative comments and accusations) without their consent.

The AEPD took certain aggravating and mitigating factors into consideration in order to determine how to sanction this violation. Some aggravating elements included the fact that the shop's posting on social networks had the immediate effect of disseminating the claimant's personal data, the fact that two people had been affected by the post, the damage caused not only by the dissemination of images but also of accusations, and the shop's lack of response to the AEPD's request to implement measures to ensure that this practice did not occur in the future.

Regarding the mitigating factors, the AEPD took into consideration that the shop's activity was not linked to any further processing of personal data, that it is a small business, that there is no evidence it had committed a previous offense, and that it had acted negligently but not maliciously.

Based on these considerations, the AEPD issued a €2,000 fine on the shop.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                            II
       Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of
the Public Administrations, in its article 64 "Agreement of initiation in the
procedures of a sanctioning nature”, provides:

       "one. The initiation agreement will be communicated to the instructor of the procedure, with
transfer of how many actions exist in this regard, and the interested parties will be notified,
understanding in any case by such the accused.
       Likewise, the initiation will be communicated to the complainant when the rules
regulators of the procedure so provide.

       2. The initiation agreement must contain at least:

       a) Identification of the person or persons allegedly responsible.
       b) The facts that motivate the initiation of the procedure, its possible
       rating and sanctions that may apply, without prejudice to what

       result of the instruction.
       c) Identification of the instructor and, where appropriate, Secretary of the procedure, with
       express indication of the system of recusal of the same.
       d) Competent body for the resolution of the procedure and regulation that
       attribute such competence, indicating the possibility that the presumed

       responsible can voluntarily acknowledge their responsibility, with the
       effects provided for in article 85.
       e) Provisional measures that have been agreed by the body
       competent to initiate the sanctioning procedure, without prejudice to those that

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 3/9

        may be adopted during the same in accordance with article 56.
        f) Indication of the right to formulate allegations and to the hearing in the
        procedure and the deadlines for its exercise, as well as an indication that, in

        If you do not make allegations within the stipulated period on the content of the
        initiation agreement, this may be considered a resolution proposal
        when it contains a precise statement about the responsibility
        imputed.

        3. Exceptionally, when at the time of issuing the initiation agreement

there are not sufficient elements for the initial qualification of the facts that motivate
the initiation of the procedure, the aforementioned qualification may be carried out in a phase
later by drawing up a List of Charges, which must be notified to
the interested".

        In application of the previous precept and taking into account that no
formulated allegations to the initial agreement, it is appropriate to resolve the initiated procedure.

                                             III
        The claimed facts materialize in the publication by the claimed without
legitimation or consent through the social network Instagram of the images of

the claimant and her partner accompanied by unfortunate comments which could
suppose a violation of the regulations on the protection of personal data.

## Article 58 of the RGPD, Powers, states:

        "two. Each control authority will have all the following powers:
rectives listed below:

        (…)
        i) impose an administrative fine pursuant to article 83, in addition to or instead of

        of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances.
        tances of each particular case;
        (…)”

        Article 6, Legality of the treatment, of the RGPD establishes:

        "one. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

        a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data

        final for one or more specific purposes;
        b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
        interested party is a party or for the application at its request of pre-contractual measures
        contractual;
        c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of an applicable legal obligation.

        cable to the data controller;
        d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or
        of another natural person;
        e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 4/9

        public interest or in the exercise of public powers vested in the controller
        of the treatment;
        f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests per-

        guided by the data controller or by a third party, provided that on
        such interests do not override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms
        data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data, in
        particularly when the interested party is a child.
        The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment
ment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.

        (…)”.

        On this question of the legality of the treatment, the Consideration also affects
40 of the aforementioned RGPD, when it states that «In order for the treatment to be free-

I quote, personal data must be treated with the consent of the interested party or
on some other legitimate basis established in accordance with law, either in the present
this Regulation or by virtue of another Law of the Union or of the Member States to
referred to in this Regulation, including the need to comply with the obligation
law applicable to the data controller or the need to perform a contract
with which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures at the request of the interested party.

resado prior to the conclusion of a contract.»

## Article 4 of the GDPR, Definitions, in section 11, states that:

        “11) «consent of the interested party»: any manifestation of free will, is-

specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through a
declaration or a clear affirmative action, the treatment of personal data that
concern”.

        Also article 6, Treatment based on the consent of the affected party,

of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data-
them and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), states that:

        "one. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, consent of the affected party is understood to be any manifestation of will
free, specific, informed and unequivocal by which he accepts, either through a

declaration or a clear affirmative action, the treatment of personal data that
concern.

        2. When the data processing is intended to be based on consent
of the affected for a plurality of purposes it will be necessary to state in a strict way

specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.

        3. The execution of the contract may not be subject to the affected party consenting to the
processing of personal data for purposes unrelated to the
maintenance, development or control of the contractual relationship”.

        Therefore, in light of the facts, it is evident that the data processing carried out
carried out by the respondent with the dissemination on Instagram of the image of the claimant
and his partner accompanied by unfortunate comments has been made without cause

legitimizing of those collected in article 6 of the RGPD.

                                             III

        The infraction attributed to the defendant is typified in the article
Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, which considers that the infringement of “the basic principles
for treatment, including the conditions for consent under the ar-
Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned article.
## Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, "with administrative fines of €20,000,000 as

maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% maximum

amount of the global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting-
I know for the highest amount”.

        The LOPDGDD in its article 71, Violations, states that: “They constitute violations
tions the acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83

of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this law
organic”.

        And in its article 72, it considers for prescription purposes, which are: "Infringements
considered very serious:

        1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
entail a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular,
ticular, the following:

        (…)
        b) The treatment of personal personal data without the concurrence of any of the
        the conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Re-
        regulation (EU) 2016/679.
        (…)”

                                             IV
        The documentation in the file shows that the defendant violates
Article 6.1 of the RGPD, when proceeding to the dissemination of the image of the claimant and
your partner, accompanied by certain comments, without any legitimizing cause
such as consent or authorization in social networks.

        It should be noted that the GDPR excludes tacit consent and requires that it be
explicit. With the entry into force of the RGPD and the new LOPDGDD, only the
express consent. The most important novelty regarding the consent that
incorporates the RGPD is based is that it must be granted through a clear affirmative act

that evidences a free, specific, informed and unequivocal declaration of will
of the interested party to admit the treatment of personal data that affect him;
that there is not the slightest doubt that there has been manifest will on the part of the
client, giving their express consent to be able to treat their personal data with
the specific purposes detailed in the form.

        The request for consent must be clear and specific, that it does not unnecessarily alter
the use of the service for which it is provided. All this only emphasizes the need
that you expressly consent to the treatment.
