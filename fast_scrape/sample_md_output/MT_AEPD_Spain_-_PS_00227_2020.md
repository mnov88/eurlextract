## English Summary

### Facts

On 23 July 2020, a citizen reported to the AEPD a harassment campaign that the company RECAMBIOS VILLALEGRE S.L. carried out through Facebook and WhatsApp against a homeless person who, according to the company, had stolen money from the office cash register.

The aforementioned company used images collected with security cameras that recorded the street pavement, without having an informative poster on the premises that mentioned the use of these cameras.

The same complainant presented another letter on July 25, 2020 to the AEPD informing that several newspapers had reported the alleged theft, that a quick trial had been held and that the indigent person had been acquitted for lack of evidence, since none of the published images could prove that the person had taken money from the offices.

Once again, the company published images of the person on Facebook with the aim of negatively affecting their reputation.

### Dispute

Is the recording of personal images (without a notice board) and their subsequent publication on social networks (Facebook and WhatsApp) an infringement of Articles 6 and 13 GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD decided to impose, for infringement of Article 6 GDPR, a fine of € 10000 and, for infringement of Article 13 GDPR, a fine of € 2000.

In addition, the company was required, within one month, to remove the Facebook posting and the comments affecting the homeless person who was harassed, to put up an information poster of the recording of images with video surveillance cameras, and to have the information for those affected required by the GDPR.

## Comment

As factors to be taken into account, in this case, were assessed:

The nature and seriousness of the infringement, taking into account the purpose of the processing operation in question as well as the level of the damage suffered; the intentionality or negligence of the infringement; that it concerns a small enterprise whose main activity is not linked to the processing of personal data That no recurrence is appreciated, since the commission of the infringement is not established, within the period of one year, of more than one infringement of the same nature.

       Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and
based on the following

                                   BACKGROUND

FIRST: Mr. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant), dated July 23, 2020,
filed a claim with the Spanish Agency for Data Protection. The

The claim is directed against RECAMBIOS VILLALEGRE, S.L., with NIF B74393992
(hereinafter, the defendant) for facts that could be violating the
legislation on protection of personal data. The main reasons on which it bases
the claim are as follows:

       «I am contacting you due to the harassment and threats that are
       frying a poor indigent from the city of \*\*\* LOCALIDAD.1 (\*\*\* PROVINCIA.1)

       with hundreds of vexatious, insulting and even threatening comments.

       also circulated by WhatsApp groups another photograph (which is attached

       together with this claim) of this person taken in this case head-on, after

       address the problem that they have intentionally caused, and after communicating

       intention that they take the appropriate measures with the aforementioned company that has

        Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: «The procedures

        The physical image of a person, in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD, is data

personal protection and their protection, therefore, is the object of said Regulation. In article 4.2
of the RGPD defines the concept of "processing" of personal data.

        It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image
of natural persons) carried out through the capture of photography and video

reported is in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

      fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data,
      in particular when the interested party is a child.
      The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the

treatment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions. "
      On this question of the legality of the treatment, the
Recital 40 of the aforementioned RGPD, when it states that “For the
treatment is lawful, personal data must be processed with consent
of the interested party or on any other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, and
either in this Regulation or by virtue of other Union law or the

Member States to which this Regulation refers, including the need to
comply with the legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the treatment or the need to
execute a contract with which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures
at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a contract. "

      In relation to the above, it is considered that there is evidence that the
treatment of data of the person who appears in the images object of this
claim has been made without justifying cause of those included in article 6
of the RGPD.

      The RGPD applies to personal data, which is defined as' data

       Second, the photograph that is extracted from the video surveillance system
installed by the claimed invades the sidewalk of the street from which you enter the premises.

      It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image
of natural persons) carried out through the video surveillance system of the
claimed is in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

      Article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, regarding the principles of treatment, provides that

personal data will be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in
relation to the purposes for which they are processed ("data minimization"). » East
article enshrines the principle of data minimization in data processing
personal. It assumes that said treatment is adjusted and proportional to the purpose to
the one that is addressed, and the processing of excessive data must be restricted or

proceed to the suppression of them.

      The relevance of the data processing must occur both in the field
of the collection of the data as in the subsequent treatment that is carried out of the

themselves.

      Article 12.1 of the RGPD states: “1. The data controller will take the

appropriate measures to provide the interested party with all the information indicated in the articles
the 13 and 14 "The RGPD lists the categories of information that must be provided to
an interested party in relation to the processing of their personal data in cases where
those that are collected from the same (article 13) or are obtained from another source (article 14).

      12.7 indicates: “The information that must be provided to interested parties by virtue of

Articles 13 and 14 may be transmitted in combination with standard icons
that allow to provide in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible way
an adequate overview of the planned treatment "

## Article 22 of the LOPDGDD establishes the specificities of the treatment of

data for video surveillance purposes, indicating the following:

      "1. Individuals or legal entities, public or private, may carry out the

acts that threaten the integrity of people, property or facilities. In that
In this case, the images must be made available to the competent authority in
a maximum period of seventy-two hours from the knowledge of the

This exclusion does not cover the treatment carried out by a security entity
private that had been hired for the surveillance of a home and had access
to the images.

       6. The treatment of personal data from images and
sounds obtained through the use of cameras and video cameras by the Forces
and Security Bodies and by the competent bodies for surveillance and control in
prisons and for the control, regulation, surveillance and discipline of the
traffic, will be governed by the transposition legislation of Directive (EU) 2016/680,

when the treatment is for prevention, investigation, detection or
prosecution of criminal offenses or execution of criminal sanctions, including

supplementary by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and this organic law.

       7. What is regulated in this article is understood without prejudice to the provisions of
Law 5/2014, of April 4, on Private Security and its development provisions.

       8. The treatment by the employer of data obtained through

of the treatment and form of contact. The importance of providing this information
in advance arises, in particular, from recital 39 of the RGPD, not being
