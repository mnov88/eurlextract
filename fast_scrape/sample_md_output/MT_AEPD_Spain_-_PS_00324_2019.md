(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent).

The reasons on which the claim is based are the collection of personal data by the claimed party, without providing the precise information to the interested parties in accordance with the regulations in force regarding the protection of personal data.

SECOND: It is verified that in the "Privacy Policy" of the mentioned website, it is indicated:

- That the respondent operates the website hosted under the domain name \*\*\*URL.1

- That said policy states that "In accordance with Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on the Protection of Personal Data (LOPD), and Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and Council, of April 27 ("General Data Protection Regulation" or "GDPR"), This Privacy Policy applies to the processing of personal data that CERRAJEROS MADRID 24H as responsible and / or responsible for them, in relation to the data that users and / or customers (individuals) provided as a result of hiring services, purchase of products or access to the blog that provides CERRAJEROS MADRID 24H, or collected in any section of the website \*\*\*URL.1

Subsequently, the Subdirectorate General for Data Inspection carried out preliminary investigative actions to clarify the facts in question, by virtue of the investigative powers granted to the supervisory authorities in Article 57.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), and in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Section Two of Organic Law 3/2018 of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD).

THIRD: On October 23, 2019, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the respondent, for the alleged infringement of Article 13 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD.

In view of all that has been done, the following are considered to be proven facts by the Spanish Data Protection Agency in these proceedings,

FACTS

FIRST: The complaint is based on the fact that the privacy policy of the person claimed does not provide all the information required by article 13 of the RGPD when personal data is obtained from the person concerned.

The claimant is informed of this complaint on June 21, 2019, and is requested to send this Agency, within a period of one month, information about the response given to the claimant for the reported facts, as well as the causes that have motivated the incident and the measures adopted to adapt its "Privacy Policy" to Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of April 27, 2016 (RGPD).

After the given deadline, no response has been obtained from the respondent.

SECOND: The respondent submitted a letter indicating the measures adopted on 11 July 2019, but due to computer problems, access to this information was not available after the initiation of the present sanctioning procedure.

LEGAL GROUNDS

I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority, and according to what is established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

II

The defendant is charged with an infringement of Article 13 of the RGPD, which states
"1.Where personal data are obtained from a data subject, the data controller shall, at the time when they are obtained, provide the data subject with all the following information
(a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where appropriate, of his representative
(b) the contact details of the Data Protection Officer, if any;

Where the controller plans to further process personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, he shall provide the data subject, prior to such further processing, with information on that other purpose and with any relevant additional information within the meaning of paragraph 2.
4.	The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply where and insofar as the information is already available to the data subject.
## Article 11 of the LOPDGDD provides as follows

"Where personal data are obtained from the data subject, the controller may fulfil the duty of information laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by providing the data subject with the basic information referred to in the following paragraph and by indicating an electronic address or other means which

In this case, the data subject must be informed of his right to object to automated individual decisions which produce legal effects on him or significantly affect him in a similar way, where this right exists in accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
III
In the present case the infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD which establishes that
"'The infringements of the following provisions shall be penalised, in accordance with paragraph 2, by administrative fines of not more than EUR 20 000 000 or, in the case of an undertaking, of not more than 4 % of its total annual turnover in the preceding business year, whichever is the greater

a Failure to comply with the principle of transparency of information or the right to information of the person concerned by not providing all the information required by Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679'.

IV

The agreement to initiate the sanctioning process that we are dealing with here had its reason to be in the complaint filed against the respondent because his website did not comply with the personal data protection regulations, specifically with the provisions of Article 13 of the RGPD which regulates the information that must be provided when personal data is obtained from the interested party.
