## English Summary

### Facts

The company has not provided to the Spanish DPA the information it requested in the course of an investigation following a complaint by Ms AAA.

### Dispute

What are the consequences of failing to comply with a DPA's request for access to information? What happens if the company penalised recognises its responsibility and proceeds to the voluntary payment of the fine imposed by the DPA?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA imposed a fine of EUR 5 000 on the company under investigation, which was reduced to EUR 3 000 for the company's voluntary payment and acknowledgment of its responsibility for the facts (in turn waiving any subsequent appeal against the decision)

VOLUNTEER
In the sanctioning procedure PS/00090/2020, conducted by the Agency
Spanish Data Protection Agency to XFERA MÓVILES, S.A., in view of the complaint
presented by A.A.A., and based on the following,
LEGAL FOUNDATIONS
I
By virtue of the powers conferred on each individual by Article 58(2) of the GPRS, the
authority, and as set out in Articles 47, 48(1), 64(2) and 68(1) of the
LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is

With the above-mentioned conduct of the respondent, the power of investigation that the
## Article 58(1) of the RGPD confers on the supervisory authorities, in this case, the AEPD,

has been hampered.
Therefore, the facts described in the "Facts" section are deemed
constitute an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of Article
58.1 of the RGPD, which provides that each supervisory authority shall have, among its
investigative powers:
"(a) to order the controller and the processor and, where appropriate, the
representative of the person in charge or of the person in charge, to provide any
information it requires for the performance of its duties; (b) carry out
investigations in the form of data protection audits

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

4/9
This infraction is typified in Article 83.5.e) of the RGPD, which considers
such as: 'failure to provide access in breach of Article 58(1)'.
The same Article states that this infringement may be penalised
with a fine of twenty million euros (20,000,000 euros) maximum or, in the case of
a company, for an amount equivalent to a maximum of four percent (4%) of
total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for the
of higher value.
For the purposes of the limitation period of the infringements, the alleged infringement
prescribes after three years, in accordance with Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which qualifies as
very serious the following behavior:
"(ñ) Failure to provide access by staff of the data protection authority
competent to personal data, information, premises, equipment and means of
processing required by the data protection authority to
the exercise of their powers of investigation.
(o) Resistance to or obstruction of the exercise of the inspection function by
competent data protection authority."
IV
In the light of the above facts, without prejudice to the
In the event that the proceedings are opened, it is considered that the defendant should be charged with
the violation of Article 58.1 of the RGPD typified in Article 83.5 e) of the RGPD. The
The sanction that should be imposed is an administrative fine.
The fine to be imposed must, in each individual case, be effective,
proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with Article 83.1 of the RGPD.
Consequently, the sanction to be imposed should be graduated according to the criteria
established by Article 83.2 of the RGPD, and with the provisions of Article 76 of the
LOPDGDD, with respect to paragraph k) of the aforementioned Article 83.2 RGPD.

established by Article 83.2 of the RGPD, and with the provisions of Article 76 of the
LOPDGDD, with respect to paragraph k) of the aforementioned Article 83.2 RGPD.
The initial assessment shows that no
The following facts have been considered to be aggravating
- Art. 83.2(b) RGPD: the intentionality or negligence in the infringement. These are
of a company that is not newly created and should have
procedures established for the fulfilment of the obligations that
provides for the data protection regulations, among them, to respond to
the requirements of the supervisory authority.
- Art. 83.2(k) RGPD: any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the
circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or
losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement. The
complaint refers to a person's particular case, but the
data processing to which it refers, can potentially affect a
very high number of customers of the responsible entity or users of the
service provided by the responsible entity.
Therefore, on the basis of the above,
By the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
