    the one that appears:

     On Saturday \*\*\* DATE 1, a computer team sends an alert via email to the
       support address indicating that several accesses have been attempted from a
       server. Access has been blocked by entering several consecutive times
       wrong password.

     On Sunday, February 9, a systems technician reviews the alert in order to
       verify the reason why a device is being accessed, since it does not
       it is a common access. By verifying that the Security Manager of the
       company that was not trying to access the equipment is turned off as a first measure

       prevention. It also checks whether other computers have been accessed in

       Responsible for Security and the rest of the accounts of
       administrator on all systems.

       It is verified that there has been no encryption, but a process is detected
       weird running on some servers so they stop
       immediately its execution.

       It is detected that one of the servers has a fraudulent active connection due to
       which proceeds to turn it off and closes the Internet connection in the
       Firewall as a precautionary measure.

       modify the passwords before the possibility that they have been seen
       committed.

     On Monday, February 10, the ITS security company that carries out
       the management of firewalls and a bad configuration is detected in the Firewall
       that allowed access from the outside. The server that gave access was

       has been turned off from the day before. It is concluded that the intrusion is
       closed and there is no unauthorized connection.

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/8

       Throughout the week, a forensic analysis of the
       intrusion and compromised machines are recovered.

       Admin passwords are changed twice again
       consecutive as an additional precautionary measure.

       No anomalous accesses or generation of fraudulent users are detected.
     On Tuesday, February 11, users are again obliged to change their

        password.
     On Wednesday, February 12, they proceed to notify the AEPD of the gap in

        security due to the type of information found on the servers
        affected, although there is no evidence that data has been compromised
        personal, for this reason they decide not to communicate the gap to possible
        affected.

       It is decided to report the facts to the Ertzaintza (annex 19).

     On Monday, February 17, the intrusion was closed and no leakage of

        information.

     On April 28, the automated review (vaccination) of all the
        servers already checked manually. No unusual activity is detected.

    Regarding the causes that made the breach possible
     The ITS provider replaces the Firewall with a new firewall.

     This Firewall allowed the attempt to connect via remote desktop with a
        administrator password that was detected to be weak and that the hack was

        he must have used a password cracking technique and later be able to
        connect to the rest of the computers.
    Regarding the affected data.

     Forensic reports commissioned from an external company and those prepared by
        GUREAK LANEAN's own IT technicians state that no

        there is evidence that any data has been affected
        personal. For this reason, they consider that there have been no consequences for
        possible affected since no data has been extracted abroad. (Annex 6 in the
        minutes dated February 12, 2020, annex 7 in the minutes of the Committee on
        security dated February 18 and annex 8 in the Minutes of February 28)

     GUREAK LANEAN states that the intrusion detection was carried out in
        early form and the volume of information exchanged abroad has
        been low relative to the existing data volume. Also in the logs of

        systems that have personal data have not been detected
        unusual accesses.

                               FOUNDATIONS OF LAW
                                               I
In accordance with the investigative and corrective powers that article 58 of the

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter
RGPD) grants each control authority, and according to the provisions of article 47 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), is competent to
resolve these investigative actions by the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection.

                                              II
The GDPR defines, in a broad way, "data security breaches
personal "(hereinafter security bankruptcy) as" all those violations of the
security that cause accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of
personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the

unauthorized communication or access to said data. "

In the present case, it is established that there was a data security breach
personal in the circumstances indicated above, categorized as a gap

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/8

confidentiality, as a consequence of a bad configuration in the Firewall
allowing access from the outside.

The investigation actions show that, prior to the gap in
security, the investigated entity had reasonable security measures in place
depending on the possible estimated risks. Provides Record of Activities of
Treatment and Risk Analysis as indicated in the history and have been taken
appropriate subsequent actions to avoid a repetition of the incident.

Likewise, it had action protocols to deal with an incident such as the
now analyzed, which has allowed diligently the identification, analysis and
classification of the personal data security breach as well as the diligent
reaction to it in order to minimize the impact and implement new
reasonable and timely measures to avoid a recurrence of the incidence in the future to

through the implementation and effective execution of an action plan by the
different figures involved such as the person responsible for the treatment and the Delegate of
Data Protection.

There are no claims made to this Agency by third parties.

Consequently, it must be concluded that the investigated entity had available measures
reasonable technical and organizational measures to avoid this type of incident and that by
insufficient data have been diligently updated. Finally, it is recommended
prepare a Final Report on the traceability of the event and its valuation analysis, in
particular, regarding the final impact. This Report is a valuable source of

information that should be fed into the analysis and risk management and will serve
to prevent the repetition of a gap with similar characteristics such as the
analyzed, predictably caused by a specific error.
                                           III
