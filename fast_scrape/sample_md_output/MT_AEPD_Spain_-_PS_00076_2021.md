## English Summary

### Facts

A worker of a clinic lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA because their employer had used their image for advertisement purposes without consent. They had placed huge banners with it in a display window.

The banners were on sight for more than a year, despite the worker's repetitive request, via different ways, for them to take them down.

Such banners were, however, taken down after the worker made a notarial request. The clinic alleged, mainly, that the worker had signed an image rights transfer agreement previous to the display of the banner.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA held that the fact that the worker had signed an image rights transfer agreement previous to the display of the banner was considered as a legal basis for data processing. Hence, they did not find a violation of Article 6.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this
process.

                                             II

Law 39/2015, of Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
Public (LPACAP) establishes in its article 89.1 that “the termination of the
procedure, with filing of the proceedings, without the need for the formulation
of the proposed resolution, when in the instruction of the procedure it is
I manifest that any of the following circumstances concur:

        a) The non-existence of the facts that could constitute the offense ”.

                                             III

The defendant is charged with committing an offense for violation of Article 6
of the RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, which indicates in its section 1 the cases in which
that the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the

      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;
      (…) "

       The offense is classified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/6

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

 Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that one and, in
in particular, the following:

       (…)
       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                          IV

In the case at hand, after a detailed study of the documents
working in this proceeding, and the claims of the claimed entity,
We must point out that the contract for the Assignment of Rights of

Image with the claimed dated January 22, 2019, with the name of the
claimant, their ID and signed by signature,
On the other hand, it is clear that once the petitioner received the notarial request

requesting the withdrawal of the claimant's images, they proceeded to withdraw the
themselves.

Likewise, it should be noted that there is currently no public image of the
claimant in Vivanta Clinics.

Therefore, the file of the present sanctioning procedure proceeds.

Considering the aforementioned precepts and others of general application, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: FILE the sanctioning procedure PS / 00076/2021, instructed to

CLÍNICA VIVANTA S.L with NIF B82809492, for having proven that the claimant

LOPDPGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the LPACAP, the
