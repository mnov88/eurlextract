## English Summary

### Facts

The Luxembourg DPA launched an investigation on a controller that had implemented a geolocation system on their snowplowing and salting vehicles.

Such system used on-line software, although the data was not transferred via WiFi but via phone cards.

The employees participated in the activities relating such vehicles on a voluntary basis. They had only been informed about the system, however, orally.

### Holding

The DPA argued that, even if [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") does not _de facto_ exclude the possibility of providing the information from Articles 13 and 14 orally, it poses an accountability problem. The controller must be able to demonstrate that it has provided such information.

However, having provided the information in an oral manner, in this case the controller could not prove that had provided the information, and therefore the DPA concluded that the controller had violated [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

The DPA took into account that the controller had implemented, during the proceedings, adequate measures to fulfill their information obligation, following the authority's proposal.

Therefore, the CNPD decided to only warn the controller.

   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                    the survey no. \[…\] carried out with the municipal administration of \[…\]

                                                                                                      6/13 17. The communication to data subjects of information relating to

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR. The said obligations were

clarified by the Article 29 Working Group in its guidelines on

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereafter: "WP 260 rev.01").

      18. Note that the European Data Protection Board (hereafter:

"EDPS"), which replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and re-approved the documents adopted by said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25
5 2018, as precisely the aforementioned guidelines on transparency.

2. In this case

      19. In the statement of objections, the head of investigation referred to a letter from

February 14, 2019, in which the latter annexed a document entitled "\[…\]

". In the said letter, the inspector also specified that "everything is being done to

also transmit the information in writing to the officers concerned. So a

personalized information letter to the attention of the agents making up the teams of the

winter service has been prepared \[…\] ”.

      20. Nevertheless, the head of the investigation found that the non-compliance with Article 13 of

GDPR was acquired on the day of the on-site visit, because the documentation submitted to it by the

the aforementioned letter contained no evidence against this non-compliance with this
precise date. The head of the investigation added that "the observation that the employees had been

informed orally, without presenting any evidence to support this

claim, is not likely to upset this finding. "(See statement of objections,

page 2, Ad.A.1.).

comments contained in his letter of September 17, 2019, which already mentioned the

procedures carried out by the inspected, following the visit of CNPD agents, in order to

comply with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR. The controlled specified that
in accordance with Article L-261-1 of the Labor Code, collective information relating to the

implementation of the geolocation system for the delegations of officials and

municipal employees, as well as employees took place by letter of August 13, 2019, a
                                                                                             er
share, and that all the agents concerned would be informed individually before the 1

November 2019, on the other hand. In addition, the controlled specified therein that the information also

been put on the intranet site of \[…\] and that the instructions were given to the services to post
information in the premises of the departments concerned. Copies of information notices

intended for delegations and employees were appended to the letter of 17

September 2019.

      22. In addition, the inspected explained in the aforementioned letter of September 17, 2019

that on that date the number of intervention vehicles equipped with a
                                        6 st
geolocation totaled \[...\] and that for November 1, 2019, thumbnails
signs would be installed in said vehicles with the following content: "...

to inform you that this vehicle is equipped with a geolocation system.

For more information, you can inquire at the following address: ... "

      23. Finally, during the Restricted Training session on November 17, 2020,

as well as in his email of November 18, 2020, the inspected confirmed that

the information notice communicated to the CNPD by the aforementioned letter of September 19

2019 has been transmitted and countersigned individually by all agents of the service
winter of \[...\].

      24. The Restricted Training first of all wishes to emphasize that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the controller to "provide" all

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the data subject or to actively direct the person

6 \[…\] vehicles for the Hygiene department and \[…\] vehicles for the Roads department.

              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                     the survey no. \[…\] carried out with the municipal administration of \[…\]

                                                                                                       8/13 regarding the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). ”(WP260 rev. 01, paragraph 33).

      25. Furthermore, it would like to point out that Article 12 of the GDPR does not de facto exclude

that the information provided for in Articles 13 and 14 may be provided orally by the

controller to the data subject. On the other hand, the WP260 rev. 01

(paragraph 21) insists that in this case the controller should ensure “to
keep a written record, and ensure that he is able to prove it (for the purposes of

compliance with the responsibility requirement), of: i) oral request for information,

ii) the method by which the identity of the data subject was verified (the case

(see point 20 above), and (iii) the fact that the information has been transmitted to
the person concerned. "

      26. During the on-site visit of CNPD agents, the inspector specifically

mentioned that the persons concerned were only informed orally about the

presence of the geolocation device in the vehicles in question as part of the

work instructions provided.

      27. Nevertheless, the Restricted Formation notes that no documentation

submitted by the inspected does not contain proof that the employees of the inspected have

been validly informed, before the on-site visit by CNPD staff, orally
in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR.

      28. In view of the above, the Restricted Formation concludes that at the time of the

site visit by CNPD agents, Article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the

control.

II. 2. On corrective measures

1. The principles

                                                       er
      29. In accordance with article 12 of the law of August 1, 2018, the CNPD has the
power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                    the survey no. \[…\] carried out with the municipal administration of \[…\]

                                                                                                     9/13 "a) notify a controller or processor that data processing operations
treatment envisaged are likely to violate the provisions of these regulations;

b) call to order a controller or a processor when the

processing operations have resulted in a violation of the provisions of this Regulation;

c) order the controller or processor to comply with the requests

presented by the data subject in order to exercise their rights under the

this regulation;

d) order the controller or processor to put the data processing operations

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

in a specific way and within a specific timeframe;

e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including a ban, of processing;

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the
restriction of processing in application of Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued in application of Articles 42 and 43, or order the

certification not to issue certification if the requirements for certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

i) impose an administrative fine in application of Article 83, in addition to or

the place of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics
specific to each case;

   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                    the survey no. \[…\] carried out with the municipal administration of \[…\]

                                                                                                    10/13 j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a
third country or to an international organization. "

      30. These measures also include the power to "impose a fine

administrative pursuant to Article 83 \[…\] ”. However, article 48.1 of the law of August 1
2018 on the organization of the National Commission for Data Protection and

of the general data protection regime specifies that “\[t\] he CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of \[GDPR\], except against

state or municipalities. ".

      31. In addition, the Restricted Training would like to point out that the facts taken into account

in the context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The

any changes relating to the processing of data subject to the investigation

intervened subsequently, even if they make it possible to fully establish or
partially compliance, do not allow retroactive cancellation of a breach

found.

      32. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the inspected to get into
compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy

shortcomings identified by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures
to pronounce.

2. In this case

      33. The adoption of the following corrective measures was proposed by the Chief

of investigation to the Restricted Training in its complementary mail to the communication

grievances of August 3, 2020:

      "A) Order the controller to complete the information measures

      intended for people affected by geolocation, in accordance with

      provisions of article 13, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR by informing

      in particular the identity of the controller, the purposes of the processing and its
      legal basis, the categories of data processed, the legitimate interests pursued

   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
             Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                    the survey no. \[…\] carried out with the municipal administration of \[…\]

                                                                                                 11/13 by the inspected, the recipients, the retention period of the data as well as
      indication of human rights and how to exercise them.

      b) To issue a call to order against the controller for

      cause of violation of the provisions of the GDPR. "

      34. The Restricted Training takes into account the steps taken by the

controlled, following the visit of CNPD agents, in order to comply with the provisions of

## Article 13 of the GDPR, as detailed in his letter of August 24, 2020. More

in particular, it takes note of the following facts, which were confirmed by the inspected
during the Restricted Training session of November 17, 2020, as well as in its

e-mail of November 18, 2020:

     The information notice regarding the geolocation of intervention vehicles,

       communicated to the CNPD by letter of September 19, 2019, has been sent and

       individually countersigned by all the agents of the Hygiene Service and
       Roads service providing the winter service of \[...\].

     Signage stickers have been installed in the intervention vehicles

       with the following content: "... would like to inform you that this vehicle is

       equipped with a geolocation system. For more information, you
       can get information at the following address: ... "

      35. Under Article 58.2.b) of the GDPR, the CNPD may call to order a

controller or a processor when the processing operations have

resulted in a violation of the provisions of the GDPR.

      36. Taking into account the fact that at the time of the site visit of the CNPD agents,

no documentation submitted by the inspected contained proof that the

employees of the inspected have been validly informed in violation of Article 13 of the GDPR, the

Restricted Training considers it justified to issue a call to order to
against the controlled.
