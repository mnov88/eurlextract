## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject filed a complaint against a legal entity (the controller) for forwarding and disclosure of personal data of borrowers (‘data subjects’) to their employers. The data subject's identification, financial and economic data was processed due to a security failure of the responsible person - a director of the risk management unit (‘director’).

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller did not meet the conditions for the lawfulness of the processing set out in [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"). As the data subjects did no consent to the sharing of their personal data with their employers, the responsible person of the employer violated [Article 96(1)(1) of the Slovenian Data Protection Law ('ZVOP-2')](https://pisrs.si/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959) for breaching the fundamental principles of data processing.

Additionally, the director failed to uphold security measures which led to the sharing of borrowers' data with their employers. The failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of borrowers' personal data constitutes an infringement of the controller's obligation under [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

Because the infringement occurred within the scope of the director's business activities and on behalf of the legal entity they represented, according [Article 96(1) ZVOP-2](https://pisrs.si/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959), the liability should be assigned to the responsible individual who committed the offense.

As a result, the DPA issued a warning to both the director and its employer and ordered them to pay a court fee of €30.

## Comment

Article 96(1)(1) ZVOP 2

(infringements of the provisions of [Article 83(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#4 "Article 83 GDPR"))

(1) A fine of between EUR 100 and EUR 5 000 shall be imposed on the person responsible for the offence, whether a legal person, a sole proprietor or an individual carrying out an activity independently:

1. if it infringes the obligations of the controller or processor as set out in Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39 and 42 and 43 of the General Regulation;

The notice of request is sent by mail or delivered directly in two copies and is considered timely if submitted on the last day of the deadline for filing the notice of request by registered mail or directly to the authority that issued the decision. The announced filing of a request for judicial protection can be withdrawn until the deadline for filing the announcement of this request expires.

If the beneficiary of the request for judicial protection does not announce or withdraws the announcement within the legal deadline for filing this request, it is considered that he has waived the right to request for judicial protection.

If none of the beneficiaries of the request for judicial protection announces this request, the misdemeanor authority does not make a decision on the offense with reasons, but it is considered that a final decision has been served on the date of service of the decision without reasons, which with the expiration of the deadline for announcing the request for judicial protection becomes final.

When at least one of the beneficiaries of the request for judicial protection announces the filing of this request, a written decision on the offense with reasons is drawn up and sent no later than thirty (30) days after the announcement of the filing of the request for judicial protection is received. In this case, the decision with reasons is served on all beneficiaries of the request for judicial protection.

Under the conditions and in accordance with the regulations governing the financial operations of the offense authority, the offender can pay the costs of the procedure (court fee) also with a non-cash means of payment.
