## English Summary

### Facts

A provider of electronic communications services ('controller) provided services to a customer ('data subject') under a contract.

The data subject filed a complaint with the DPA and stated that he received the controller's bill payment reminders, which were sent to the applicant's email address on monthly basis, although the data subject paid the bills for services on time. The data subject indicated and provided evidence that he had repeatedly asked the controller not to send these reminders. Additionally, he was not provided with any opt-out option from receiving the unwanted emails.

The controller indicated that reminders were sent to the data subject due to the necessity to perform the contract in accordance with [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR"). Additionally, the controller presented arguments regarding the possibility of applying a legitimate interest condition as per [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), emphasizing data controller’s interest in receiving payment for services on time.

The controller admitted that the data subject had always paid the bills by the dates specified in the controller's documents and reminders.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller could not justify the processing of the data based on [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR"). The processing of the data subject's email address for the purpose of sending reminders was not necessary in order to fulfill the contract concluded with the data subject.

Furthermore, the DPA found that processing based on the controller's legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR is in principle possible, however the controller must prove, in each case of refusal to honor an objection, that the reasons for processing outweigh the data subject's interests, rights, and freedoms.

As a result, the controller's refusal to honor the data subject's objection to the processing of their e-mail address constituted a violation of [Article 21(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#1 "Article 21 GDPR").

Therefore, the data subject's complaint was accepted and the controller received instructions to satisfy the data subject's request to implement the right to object with the processing of their email address for sending payment reminders.
