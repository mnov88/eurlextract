commission of an offence, as stipulated in Article 22.2 of the ISESA, according to which
"Service providers may use data storage and retrieval devices in terminal equipment of recipients, provided that the recipients have given their consent after the information has been provided
clear and complete on its use, in particular on the purposes of the processing of
