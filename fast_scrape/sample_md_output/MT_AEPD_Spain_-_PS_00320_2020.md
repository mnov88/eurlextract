## English Summary

### Facts

An action for breach of contract was filed against the claimant. The claimant stated that they only became aware of the contract when the lawsuit was filed, because the respondent (the accommodation company) had signed the contract on the claimant’s behalf without the claimant knowing.

### Dispute

Were the actions of the respondent a violation of the GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held that the actions of the company violated Article 6 GDPR. According to the decision, acting as the claimant’s personal representative and signing a contract on their behalf without their consent, meant that the company had processed the claimant’s personal data without a lawful ground for doing so.

The AEPD fined the company €6000. They considered the respondent’s lack of cooperation with the AEPD during the investigation of the complaint, and the respondent’s use of the claimant’s basic personal identifiers (name, address and ID number) during the processing, to be aggravating factors in determining the amount of the fine.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                           I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                           II

       Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data
and guarantee of digital rights, in its article 4.11 defines the consent of the
interested as “any manifestation of free will, specific, informed and

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/6

unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through a declaration or a
clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that concerns you ”.

        Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the following:

        1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

        a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;

        b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
pre-contractual;

        c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation
applicable to the person responsible for the treatment;

        d) the treatment is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or
of another natural person;

        e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in
public interest or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the person responsible for
treatment;

        f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests
pursued by the data controller or by a third party, provided that on

said interests do not prevail the interests or the rights and freedoms
fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data, in
particular when the interested party is a child.

        The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the
treatment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.

        In this sense, Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes that “in accordance with

the provisions of article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is understood as
consent of the affected party any manifestation of free will, specific,
informed and unequivocal by which it accepts, either through a statement or
a clear affirmative action, the treatment of personal data that concerns him ”.

                                             III

      According to the available evidence, it is considered that the
facts denounced, that is, that the defendant acted as the legal representative of the

claimant, intervened on behalf and on behalf of the claimant, signing in his
name and consigning the personal data of the claimant, without any legitimation
on the part of the claimed party, constitutes an infringement of the principle of legitimation in the
data processing.

      This action assumes that he processed the personal data of the claimant (name,

surnames and D.N.I.), without having legitimacy for the treatment of the data of the
claimant, thereby violating art. 6 of the RGPD.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/6

      Well, with regard to the facts that are the subject of this claim,
We must emphasize that the defendant, despite the repeated requests he received from the
AEPD to explain the facts about which it relates, never answered or

provided any evidence that would allow estimating that the treatment of the data of the
claimant had been legitimate.

      We refer on the matter to the request for information that the AEPD
addressed the defendant within the framework of E / 03725/2020. Request whose reception by him
It is proven (certificate issued by the FNMT) that it happened on June 9,

2020. However, no response was received and on September 16,
this year the claim was agreed to be admitted for processing. Reminder that,
limited to the violation of article 6.1. of the RGPD, its purpose is to put

it is clear that the respondent has had ample opportunities to provide evidence or
documents that certify that, contrary to the statements and evidence
documents provided by the claimant, the data processing that is the subject of
The assessment in this case was adjusted to the Law.

      Likewise, the notification of the Agreement to initiate this procedure, which

was notified electronically on October 20, 2020, without stating allegations
the same.

      The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
Obligations imposed by the regulations for the protection of personal data

It is thus obvious. A diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
of third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in conditions
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility)

      In short, there is evidence in the file that the defendant treated the

personal data of the claimant without standing for it. The behavior described
violates article 6.1. of the RGPD and is subsumable in the sanctioning type of the article
83.5.a, of the RGPD.

                                           IV

       Article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD states that “depending on what it establishes
Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and
The infractions that suppose a substantial violation will prescribe after three years
of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

    c) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions
    of legality of the treatment in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                            V

       Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: “Each control authority
will have all of the following corrective powers listed below:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/6

       b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with
warning when the processing operations have violated the provisions of
these Regulations;

       d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified time;

       i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition or in

place of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances
of each particular case;

                                           SAW

       This offense can be sanctioned with a fine of € 20,000,000 maximum
or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
higher amount, in accordance with article 83.5 of the RGPD.

       Likewise, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted according to

with the following criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:

       As aggravating factors the following:

       - The null cooperation with the AEPD in order to remedy the infraction and
mitigate its effects (article 83.2.f, of the RGPD)

       -Basic personal identifiers (name,

surname, address, D.N.I.) (article 83.2 g).

       Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and the criteria of

graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been accredited, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE SERVICIO DE ALOJAMIENTOS RESPONSABLES, S.L., with
NIF B19517911, for a violation of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in Article

83.5 of the RGPD, a fine of 6,000 euros (six thousand euros).
