## English Summary

### Facts

In 2019, the Ministry of Interior, in implementation of a Greek legislation, introduced the ‘special foreign electoral registry’ (the Registry) for the facilitation of the exercise of electoral rights by voters outside the Greek Territory, containing voters personal data, including their email address.

On 1 March 2024 a Greek MEP associated with the Party used the personal email addresses that Greeks abroad had used for their registration in the special electoral list for Greeks abroad in the year 2023 through the web portal of the Ministry of Interior "apodimoi.gov.gr", to send them unsolicited political communication.

Between 1 March and 16 May 2024, the DPA (Hellenic Data Protection Authority-HDPA) received several complaints from Greeks living abroad against the MEP and the Ministry of Interior (the Ministry) for the unauthorised leakage of their email addresses to the MEP.

The DPA initiated investigations and discovered that in June 2023 the Ministry leaked that data from the Registry through the WhatsApp platform to some executives of the Party in governmental positions, amongst which, the General Secretary of Expatriates (the Secretary). The latter used some data from the Registry for statistical analysis of the results of the 2023 parliamentary elections for political conclusions. In January 2024, the MEP requested and received from the Secretariat of Expatriates the full register.

The DPA imposed a fine to the Party in the amount of €30,000 for violating Article 25(1) and [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). It found that the technical and organisational measures taken by the Party, as a controller, did not include the activities of its secretariats and that the party executives did not sign a confidentiality agreement. Their privacy policy regarding the use of personal devices by its executives was incomplete and limited and left without supervision or guidance party executives and staff who were known to process personal data. Moreover, the DPA imposed a fine in the amount of €10,000 for the violation of Article 5(1)(a) and [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"), finding that the Secretary unlawfully used the data from the Registry on behalf of the party for demographic statistical analysis serving the purposes of the party. With the same decision the DPA also imposed a fine to the Secretary and to another Party executive for the unlawful processing of personal data.

The Party contested the decision of the DPA before the Supreme Administrative Court (Council of State – ΣτΕ).

### Holding

First, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the Party implemented sufficient technical and organisation measures designed to implement data protection principles, (Article 25(1) and [Article 25(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#2 "Article 25 GDPR")), ensure the security of processing against risks and adequately supervise all users (Article 32(1) and [Article 32(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#4 "Article 32 GDPR")). All measures included the activities of the Secretariats as well, according to their privacy and cybersecurity policy. The Supreme Administrative Court also pointed out that the assessment of the appropriateness of the measures is based upon their capacity to mitigate, not eliminate the risks. Additionally, according to the Party’s privacy policy, their official internal means of communication is done through the user’s official email accounts and any communication using other digital media or online applications are personal communications of those who use them which the Party cannot and in any case has no legitimacy to control.

Second, the Supreme Administrative Court held that it was not justified beyond reasonable doubt that the Minister processed personal data for statistical purposes in relation to his official duties as an executive of the Party or was in any case instructed to do so. Therefore, the Party was not the controller of this processing.

Consequently, the Supreme Administrative Court annulled the contested decision in so far as it imposes a fine of €30,000 to the Party for the infringement of Article 25(2) and [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") and the related obligation to remedy the deficiencies found in the measures for the protection of personal data. It also annulled the contested decision for the part it imposed a €10,000 fine for the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) and [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") for processing of personal data relating to statistical analysis as inadequately reasoned.

## Comment

2 Counsels expressed dissenting opinions and supported the DPA's decision.

Because, as follows from the information in the file, two hundred and thirty-six (236) complaints and requests from Greeks abroad were submitted to the APDPH from 1.3.2024 to 16.4.2024 against …. (hereinafter: A.M.A.), then a New Democracy MEP, for political communication via e-mail messages not requested by the complainants. The communication took place on 1.3.2024 using the A.M.A. personal e-mail addresses, which all complainants had used for their registration in the special electoral list abroad in the year 2023 through the website of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter: M.I.) “apodimoi.gov.gr”. The AMA email, entitled “100 days before the European elections”, was sent on the same day (1.3.2024) and in close proximity to (another) informational email from the Ministry of the Interior to Greeks abroad, regarding the legally provided (Law 5083/2024) postal vote for the participation of voters in the European elections. The complainants reported that when they attempted to unsubscribe from the list of recipients of the AMA message, the information appeared that the list was called “EXPARIS”. Some stated that they used the specific email address exclusively for their communications with the Greek State. During the same period, sixty-six (66) complaints by Greeks abroad against the Ministry of the Interior were submitted to the AMA. for a violation of their personal data due to an alleged leak of the email address from the Ministry of Interior to the AMA. Following the above complaints, the AMA conducted extensive inspections (request for information and data from the persons involved, on-site inspections at the facilities of the Ministry of Interior.  and the New Democracy) from which the following emerged: a) There was indeed a leak of the special foreign electoral list from the Ministry of Internal Affairs during the month of June 2023, and the personal data that was processed did not come from the list. The leak of the special electoral list took place in the form of an electronic file of the "excel" type, which bore the title "Expatriates per Department for Electoral Lottery - Parliamentary Elections June 2023.xlsx" and had been legally created, on 8.6.2023, by the services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the needs of the process of the parliamentary elections of June 2023. b) The electoral list was received, in the above electronic file format, initially via the online messaging application "WhatsApp" to .... (hereinafter: A.K.), who had the capacity of the Organizing Secretary of Local Government and Crisis Management of the New Democracy. According to A.K.'s allegations, the list was forwarded to him by an associate of the then Secretary General (S.G.) of the Ministry of the Interior. …. (hereinafter: M.S.). c) A.K. forwarded the list in the same manner to …. (hereinafter: N.Th.) on 23 June 2023, on the eve of the parliamentary elections of 25.6.2023. N.Th. at that time had the status of Secretary of Overseas Greeks or Diaspora (hereinafter: Secretary of Overseas Greeks) of the N.D.. This was done, according to N.Th., in order for some of the data in the list, such as the gender and age of the voters, to be used for statistical analysis of election results by the N.D.. N.Th. retained the special overseas electoral list in its possession (in electronic file format) after that time. d) To the N.D., as to other political parties, the disputed special overseas electoral list had been granted by the Ministry of the Interior on a storage medium (CD), as stipulated in the electoral legislation, in view of the parliamentary elections of May and June 2023, without including email addresses and contact numbers of overseas voters. e) In January 2024, the A.M.A. requested by telephone, through associates of her office, from the Information Technology Directorate of N.D. to provide data of party executives to its organizations abroad. During the above telephone communication, N.D. was asked to submit the request in writing. Subsequently, the AMA requested this data from N.D. by e-mail on 22.1.2024. The message was answered on the same day and the data of the party executives were provided with the recommendation to contact the Secretariat for Overseas Citizens for any non-updated data. f) However, before the written communication between N.D. and A.M.A., the latter contacted N.Th., met him on 20.1.2024 and requested the details of the special foreign electoral list in full, including remote communication details (such as email addresses), so that he could communicate with registered voters. g) N.Th. agreed to transmit to A.M.A. the electoral list he held, informing her that he had legally obtained it due to his capacity as a representative of N.D. in an inter-party committee of the Ministry of the Interior in the 2023 elections. The transmission to A.M.A. was made via "WhatsApp" on the afternoon of 20.1.2024. A.M.A. used the voters' email addresses to send the aforementioned email on 1.3.2024, with which she promoted the institutionalized postal vote and her candidacy in the European elections of 9.6.2024. 7. Whereas, the APDPH with the contested decision 38/2024 accepted the following: (a) The file of the special foreign electoral list for the parliamentary elections of June 2023 was sent via the application (exchange of electronic messages) "WhatsApp" on 23.6.2023 at 17:05 by A.K., then Organizational Secretary of Local Government and Crisis Management of the New Democratic Party, to N.Th., then Secretary for Expatriates of the New Democratic Party. A similar transfer of a personal data file was supported by N.Th. that it had taken place by the same means, between the same persons, on 26.5.2023, when an “excel” file entitled “Voters of 21 May 2023 in Lithuania.xlsx” was sent. A relevant document was submitted in proof of the latter claim (with no. prot. C/EIS/5980/17.7.2024), “\[t\]he exact content of this file, i.e. whether it contained similar categories of data, did not emerge”. (b) At the above time, the aforementioned persons (A.K. and N.Th.) were members of the New Democracy Party, in accordance with the party’s statutes (article 33). (c) In the responsibilities of the Secretariat for Expatriates of the New Democracy Party include "the preparation and support of the participation of Electors Abroad in the National Elections and the European Elections", as well as "any other issue that interests the Party, is important for the Party and is related to the Greeks Abroad, as well as any other issue that concerns Ecumenical Hellenism, its interests and national interests, in accordance with the directions of the Central Administration of the Party", as stated in the Regulation of Operation of Organizations of Greeks Abroad. (d) The purpose of the Secretariat of Local Government and Crisis Management of the New Democracy is, according to what is stated on the website, "the analysis and elaboration of policies on issues of Local Government. The utilization of the knowledge of the members to support the party's bodies on issues of local and regional self-government. The elaboration of political proposals on issues of Local Government ... The Secretariat of Local Government carries out a series of actions with the aim of recording and highlighting the issues that concern local government nationwide. At the same time, it supports the representatives in the collective bodies to strengthen the administrative autonomy and financial self-reliance of local government". (e) Although general instructions had been given by the New Democracy Party for the implementation of the GDPR and for the observance of confidentiality towards third parties, it was not proven that the above-mentioned party Secretaries had been given more specific instructions in relation to the processing of data in the context of exercising their, according to the above, broadly formulated responsibilities. Furthermore, it was not proven that in practice the party Secretaries sign a confidentiality agreement, such as the one presented by the New Democracy Party. in a standard form, since no corresponding signed confidentiality agreement between the party and N.Th. and A.K. was submitted to the Authority by any party (although, as stated on page 9 of the contested decision, N.Th. stated that he signed such an agreement at the party's offices, but without keeping a copy). (f) A.K.'s claim regarding telephone communication, in June 2023, with the then Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior, M.S., and regarding the sending to A.K. of the disputed electronic file by an unnamed associate of M.S. was not confirmed by any other evidence. (g) The time of sending the relevant "excel" files, specifically on 26.5.2023 of the file "Elections of 21 May 2023 in Lithuania.xlsx" and on 23.6.2023 of the file "Natives by Department - BUL Ekl Jun 2023.xlsx" (parliamentary elections of 25.6.2023) corresponds to the purposes of processing invoked by N.Th., namely, (A) for the Lithuanian file, that the purpose was to communicate with citizens, to deregister from the foreign electoral roll for Lithuania and vote in Greece, and (B) for the file sent on 23.6.2023, that the purpose was the statistical processing of the election results. In particular, N.Th. with a memorandum of 29.7.2024 (Γ/ΕΙΣ/6235/29.7.2024) he provided a screenshot of a conversation via "WhatsApp", in a group of N.D., from which it appears that on 24.6.2023 he sent a file entitled "ELECTIONS COMPARATIVELY INTERIM.pdf", which, according to what he stated, included the statistical analysis of the participation of overseas voters (without, however, mentioning specific elements of this "analysis"). He himself (N.Th.) provided with the no. prot. G/ΕΙΣ/7447/27.9.2024 memorandum (dated 26.9.2024) screenshot ("WhatsApp Image"), which shows a table from an "excel" file entitled "Diaspora - Election Results June 2023 - Detailed", which includes the columns "City", "ND", "Women %", "Median Age" and relevant conversations between N.Θ. and I.S. (director of N.D.). N.D. submitted with the memorandum dated 26.9.2024 (G/ΕΙΣ/7435/26.9.2024) the content of the file "Diaspora - Election Results 21\_5\_23.xls", which is depicted, as it stated, in the submitted conversations via "WhatsApp" between N.Θ. and I.S., a fact which demonstrates, according to the ΑΠΠΧΧ, that N.Θ. carried out, within the framework of its responsibilities, statistical analyses. (h) It was found that there was a lack of clear instructions to the organs of the New Democracy Party as to their precise responsibilities and the way in which they were to fulfill their duties, with the result that the personal data file illegally extracted by the Ministry of the Interior was actually used for the purposes of detailed statistical analysis of the electoral result of the New Democracy Party by city, age and gender. It was also found that for a long period of time three senior executives of the New Democracy Party (A.K., N.Th., A.M.A.) processed, at different points in time, the disputed electoral lists. (i) The party's policy in relation to the use of official means of communication concerned only communications with third parties and did not exclude the use of the medium ("WhatsApp") used in this case between party bodies and executives. The application in question was widely used for communications within the party, but also for sending files, evidence from which it can be concluded that this specific method of communication and exchange of information was a common practice, followed even for sending files containing personal data. 8. Because, with regard to the attribution of responsibilities and the imposition of sanctions and administrative measures against N.D., the following emerges from the contested decision: (a) The APDPH unanimously found that the technical and organizational measures that N.D. had taken, as "controller", in order to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in accordance with the GDPR, did not include the activities of its Secretariats.  Although the party's organization was specific, based on its statutes, its policies in relation to the data and personal devices of the executives were incomplete and limited to the internal network, since, as it turned out, the execution of a significant part of the relevant activities was carried out by the personal devices of the party executives, for which there was no provision "in relation to the control of the personal data that might be processed with them". The consequence of the above was to violate the provision of article 25 par. 1 of the GDPR, given that already "by design" the New Democracy left without supervision or guidance party organs and personnel, which were known to be processing personal data. In the opinion of some members of the Authority, the lack of a data protection policy, as well as the absence of practical control rules, facilitated in this case the unlawful collection, internal circulation and maintenance of the disputed file by N.Th. (former Secretary of Expatriates of the New Democracy), as well as its use for the original purpose of this file (statistics during the June 2023 elections). In the opinion of the same members, it was also found that even after the notification of the incident under review, as well as the finding that two party bodies (A.K., N.Th.) were involved in it, the New Democracy did not proceed with a thorough investigation of the circumstances under which unlawful data processing by persons acting under its supervision took place, in accordance with Article 29 of the GDPR, and did not take appropriate action to examine the possible need to take further measures to prevent the risk of unlawful processing of personal data in the future. The check carried out on the Secretariat’s computer within the premises of Nea Dimokratia was not sufficient, since it was known that data was kept on personal devices. For the above, the APDPH imposed on N.D., in application of Articles 25 par. 1 and 32 of the GDPR, a fine of 30,000 euros. (b) The APDPH ruled that N.D. must be considered a controller in relation to the processing of personal data of the disputed file of a special foreign electoral register, which was received by N.Th. on 23.6.2023 according to the above. The processing took place, according to the Authority, within the framework of the responsibilities and duties assigned to N.Th. as Secretary for Overseas Citizens and served the purposes of the party (demographic statistical analysis of the June 2023 election result in order to draw political conclusions). It was therefore carried out on behalf of N.D. as controller. The said processing was carried out in violation of the provisions providing for the legal procedure for the delivery of electoral registers to political parties by the Ministry of the Interior. during the pre-election period and therefore in violation of the basic principle of the lawfulness of the processing of personal data (art. 5 par. 1 lit. a' and art. 6 par. 1 of the GDPR). For this violation, a fine of 10,000 euros was imposed on N.D. (c) The Authority ordered N.D. to delete all the data of foreign voters that it had in its possession through the described processing, as well as to remedy the deficiencies in the procedures for the protection of personal data and to ensure their observance by party executives. 9. Since, as follows from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding the interpretation of the term "controller", as defined by Article 4(7) of the GDPR (the provision of Article 2(d) of the previous Directive 95/46/EC had a similar content), the above provisions broadly define the "controller" as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, "determines the purposes and means of processing" of personal data. The purpose of the broad definition, which expressly includes legal persons, is to ensure effective protection of the fundamental freedoms and rights of natural persons, and in particular to ensure a high level of protection for each person with regard to the personal data concerning them. Therefore, any natural or legal person who influences the processing of personal data for his own purposes and participates in determining the purposes and means of the processing may be considered to be a ‘controller’, without the aforementioned determination being required to be made by written instructions or guidelines from the controller. Furthermore, it is apparent from the wording and purpose of Article 4(7) of the GDPR that the EU legislature did not, in establishing liability under that regulation, distinguish between natural and legal persons, since that liability is subject only to the condition that those persons, alone or jointly with others, determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. Therefore, any person who meets the above condition, regardless of whether he is a natural or legal person, a public authority, an agency or another body, is liable, inter alia, for any infringement referred to in Article 83 of the GDPR, committed by him or on his behalf. In particular, legal persons or bodies which, regardless of whether they have legal personality, have an internal structure and organisation similar to legal persons, are liable not only for infringements committed by their representatives, directors or administrators, but also for those committed by any person acting within the framework of the activity of the legal person or body and on its behalf. These persons include those who, according to Article 29 of the GDPR, act under the supervision of the controller and whose acts are attributed, by implication, to the latter. A prerequisite, however, for the above liability of legal persons or bodies as controllers - without prejudice to their responsibility for taking the necessary control measures, pursuant to Article 32(4) of the GDPR, in relation to persons acting under their supervision pursuant to Article 29 of the Regulation - is that the processing of personal data undertaken by the above persons, regardless of their legality, does not exceed the limits set by the controller for its activities and needs. As is the case in particular when the persons in question act for their own purposes, other than those determined by the controller, or in a manner incompatible with the framework determined by the latter or in a manner to which it cannot reasonably be assumed that the controller would have given his consent (see ECJ decisions of 5.12.2023, Deutsche Wohnen, C-807/21, paragraphs 39-44, of 5.12.2023, Nacionalinis visiemos sveikatos centras, C-683/21, paragraphs 29-31, 36, 85, and of 10.7.2018, Jehovan todistajat, C-25/17, paragraphs 66-68, 70-72, see also CoE 1713/2023). 10. Because, as follows from the contested decision, the APDPC held the applicant political party liable, as "controller", and imposed a fine of 10,000 euros and an obligation to delete personal data, regarding the processing of the disputed electronic file of voters abroad by N.Th., the former Secretary of Expatriates of the New Democracy Party, after accepting that the processing took place "in the context of fulfilling the responsibilities and duties assigned to him and served the purposes of the party (demographic statistical analysis of the June 2023 election result in order to draw political conclusions) \[and\] therefore was carried out on behalf of New Democracy, as controller". A crucial element for the attribution of the above liability, based on the objective nature of the relevant violation under Article 83 (par. 5) of the GDPR, was, according to the contested decision, the "screenshot (WhatsApp Image) submitted by N.Th. with the memorandum of 26.9.2024 (submitted to the Authority on 27.9.2024 with no. prot. C/ΕΙΣ/7447/27.9.2024) showing a table from an excel file entitled "Diaspora - Election Results June 2023 - Detailed", which includes the columns "City", "ND" (note: percentage), "Women %", "Median Age"...". This is because the above table includes information on the gender and age of the voters, which, according to N.Th.'s allegations, could and were drawn from the disputed special foreign electoral list. However, from the said screen shot (which is an element of the file), which shows the date “2024-09-26... ” ‒ i.e. the same as the date (26.9.2024) of N.Th.’s memorandum and one day earlier than its submission to the ΑΠΔΠΧ ‒ it is not clear either the time of creation (by N.Th.) of the depicted table or whether and when the table was transmitted, in any way, to N.D. or whether it was received by the director of the I.S. party or another of its executives. Moreover, although N.Th.’s allegations regarding the above processing of personal data were considered crucial by the APDPC for attributing liability to the requesting political party, there is no specific assessment of them as to whether and in what way personal data of voters concerning gender or age and included in an electoral roll are actually correlated with a "statistical analysis" of known election results. In addition to the above, N.Th. provided the aforementioned screen capture ("WhatsApp Image") with a memorandum that he submitted to the APDPC on 27.9.2024 late, given that the deadline for submitting memoranda that had been set after the hearing held on 17.9.2024 before the Authority expired on 26.9.2024, as follows from the relevant "Exact Extract of the Minutes of the Plenary Session (17-09-2024)" of the APDPC.  Although the Authority considered the said depiction and its content as a crucial element for attributing liability to the applicant N.D., it did not, as it should have done, bring this element to its attention and did not ask for its views as to whether and under what circumstances the depicted electoral results analysis table was a product of personal data processing during the internal operation of the applicant political party. Given the above data, the crucial assumption, according to the contested decision, that, in the context of the internal party operations and the activity of the specific executives of N.D., the disputed processing of personal data took place is not justified in a manner that is beyond doubt. Furthermore, neither the contested decision nor the information in the file provides any indication as to the reasons why N.D. was considered a "controller" in relation to the specific processing, in the sense that it determined or encouraged or even consented to the use, as a means of processing, of an illegal digital file, originating from a leak from the Ministry of the Interior, despite the fact that it legally possessed the special foreign electoral register, following its grant by the Ministry of the Interior, and had all the relevant data (city, gender, age of voters) that were allegedly used during the processing in question (cf. opinions of the Attorney General of the Hellenic Republic M. S. of 6.2.2025, Russmedia Digital and Inform Media Press, C-492/23, points 105 and 107). Consequently, the contested decision of the APDPH, insofar as it imposes on the applicant political party, in its capacity as "controller", a fine of 10,000 euros for processing personal data which concerned "demographic statistical analysis of the June 2023 election result in order to draw political conclusions" (violation of Articles 5 para. 1 letters a and b and 6 para. 1 of the GDPR), and further gives N.D. the order to delete all the data of foreign voters in its possession through the relevant processing, is inadequately reasoned and must be annulled on the basis of the relevant ground for annulment. 11. Since, as stated in recital no. 78 of the GDPR, “\[t\]he protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data requires the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that the requirements of this Regulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller should adopt internal policies and implement measures which comply in particular with the principles of data protection by design and by default. Such measures could include, inter alia, minimising the processing of personal data, pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible, transparency regarding the operations and processing of personal data, so that the data subject can monitor the processing and the controller can create and improve security features…”. In recital no. Article 83 of the GDPR further states that “\[t\]o maintain security and prevent processing in breach of this Regulation, the controller or processor shall assess the risks presented by the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as, for example, encryption. Those measures shall ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. When assessing the risk to data security, attention shall be paid to the risks arising from the processing of personal data, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, which could lead to physical, material or non-material harm.” As, moreover, it follows from the case law of the D.E. on the obligation of the controller to take appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in accordance with the GDPR, Article 24 of the Regulation lists in paragraph 1 certain criteria that must be taken into account for the assessment of the suitability of such measures and, in particular, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In this context, Articles 25 (paragraphs 1 and 2) and 32 of the GDPR specify the obligations of the controller to take appropriate technical and organizational measures. The above articles concern, on the one hand, the design of processing and its limitation only to the data that are necessary for the respective processing purpose (protection already “by design” and “by definition”), and, on the other hand, the assurance of an appropriate level of security against the relevant risks (processing security), which, according to paragraph 2 of article 32, are taken into account when assessing the appropriate level of security. The references in the GDPR to “appropriate level of security” and to “appropriate level of security” indicate, according to the P.E.E., that the regulation establishes a risk management system and does not aim to eliminate the risks of personal data breaches. Therefore, it follows from the wording of the above provisions of the GDPR that they simply impose on the controller the obligation to take technical and organizational measures to avoid, to the extent possible, any infringement of personal data. The appropriateness, moreover, of the measures must be assessed in a specific manner, by examining whether the controller has put in place and applied those measures, taking into account the various criteria provided for in the aforementioned provisions, the data protection needs inherent in the specific processing, as well as the risks involved in such processing. Therefore, the above articles of the GDPR cannot be interpreted as meaning that a specific breach is sufficient to conclude that the measures taken by the controller were not appropriate within the meaning of those provisions. The above interpretation is confirmed, in accordance with the same case law of the ECJ, by recital 83 of the GDPR, which refers to the controller’s obligation to implement measures “to mitigate the risks”. It follows from this wording that the EU legislator expressed the intention to “mitigate” the risks of personal data breaches and not to eliminate them. As regards, moreover, the manner in which the national courts, and by extension the competent national authorities, must assess the suitability of the technical and organisational measures implemented by the controller, it follows from Article 32(1) and (2) of the GDPR that this must be assessed in two stages. In the first stage, the risks of personal data breaches resulting from the processing in question and their potential consequences for the rights and freedoms of natural persons must be identified. That assessment must be carried out in a specific manner, taking into account the degree of likelihood of the risks identified and their degree of seriousness. In a second stage, it must be verified whether the measures taken by the controller are adapted to the risks, taking into account the latest developments, the cost of implementation, as well as the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. Therefore, in order for the relevant authority to verify the suitability of the technical and organizational measures adopted and implemented by the controller on the basis of the above provisions (art. 24, 25, 32) of the GDPR, it must proceed to a substantive examination of the measures in the light of the criteria mentioned in the above articles, as well as the particular circumstances of the specific case. This examination therefore requires a specific analysis of both the nature and the content of the measures implemented by the controller, the manner in which they were implemented and their practical consequences on the level of security that the controller was required to guarantee, taking into account the risks inherent in the processing (see judgments of the ECJ of 25.1.2024, MediaMarktSaturn, C-687/21, paragraphs 38-40, and of 14.12.2023, Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite, C-340/21, paragraphs 29-35 and 42-46). 12. Since, N.D. with the memorandum dated 13.5.2024 before the APDPC (Γ/ΕΙΣ/4191/13.5.2024) stated the following: (1) In the “General Personal Data Processing Policy”, which is published on the N.D. website, article 43 of its Statute (published on the same website) is specifically reflected, according to which the N.D. (par. 1) “processes personal data of its members in accordance with European and Greek legislation, for political communication purposes. ... The New Democracy does not, as a rule, communicate or transmit personal data to third parties. The recipients of the data are the Party Bodies, the Panhellenic Organization, the ONNED, as well as the IDKK. The Secretariats are Bodies of the Party's Central Administration, responsible for the organizational and functional development, direction and coordination of their areas of action.  (2) In relation to transfers of data exclusively of its members, par. 2 of the same article (of the Statute) stipulates that “New Democracy may communicate the personal data of its members to candidate Presidents of the Party, to Ministers or Deputy Ministers ... to members of the Party’s Parliamentary Group, to Members of the European Parliament of the Party, to candidate Members of the Greek Parliament and to candidate Members of the European Parliament ...”. (3) N.D. processes exclusively and only personal data that fall into one of the categories mentioned in the party's "General Personal Data Processing Policy", namely (a) Members, Interested Parties and Friends, with the legal basis for processing being the consent of the subjects, and (b) Citizens Registered in the Electoral Registers, without any reference to contact details (telephone numbers, email), which are communicated to it, as a political party, by the Ministry of the Interior. in the legal time periods and are not transmitted. (4) In the "CRM" system, within which the N.D. database is located, the party members' details are kept, as updated and cross-referenced with the official electoral registers. Only the executives of the IT Directorate have access to this database. (5) The organizational and technical security measures that the N.D. has taken in the context of its compliance with the provisions of data protection law, technically exclude the registration and maintenance of a file in the party's database by any Secretariat. (6) The party's Member Register is kept exclusively by the N.D. Information Technology Directorate, which is solely responsible for transmitting personal data to party members. (7) The Data Recipients under article 43 of the N.D. Statute do not keep a member file, but may, for the exercise of their sector's responsibilities, receive, through the special request procedure provided by the Information Technology Directorate (as solely responsible for the maintenance, processing and transmission of member data), the member file in its entirety or parts thereof for a specific purpose. (8) The electronic communications of the N.D. between those entitled to maintain a personalized email with approved access to the party's server are made through the official email account (domain:@nd.gr). Any communication using other digital media or online applications, such as “WhatsApp”, does not constitute communications of N.D., but personal communications of those who carry them out, which the party cannot and in any case is not entitled to control. (12) The files and the history of sending and receiving electronic mail on the N.D. email server are kept “indefinitely” and the event logs are kept for a period of 60 days. (13) N.Th. (former Secretary for Overseas Greeks) connected to the N.D. network via his own laptop, on a network with limited access. Apart from his email, he did not have access to other N.D. systems, in accordance with the overall implemented policy of proper use of private devices (“Bring your own device” - BYOD), which is included in the party’s “Cybersecurity Policy”. (13) The N.Th. was not requested to delete/destruct files with personal data, since it was not known exactly what the disputed file (special foreign electoral list) contained and in order not to hinder the unhindered conduct of the investigation by the competent authorities. Furthermore, immediately after the announcement of the resignation of N.Th. from the position of Secretary for Overseas Persons, a thorough check was carried out (similar to the on-site check at the N.D. carried out by the members of the APDPC inspection team on 11.4.2024) and no files were found via email and the party's file server, which were relevant to the case. The provision of N.Th. access to all the party's information systems was also interrupted. (14) N.Th.'s personal laptop was not checked. for any records, except those kept through the party's server, given that, on the one hand, the party does not have this right nor could it have had knowledge with certainty or even a serious suspicion of a possible violation and, on the other hand, it was known to N.Th. that he himself, since he ceased to have the status of Secretary of the party, did not have the right to keep records during the "Implementation of the Cybersecurity Policy", of which the executives and employees of the party are informed and according to which all legal users are obliged to protect the data for as long as they maintain the status of "Legal User" and to destroy them immediately afterwards. (15) The party adequately complies with the technical and organizational measures provided for by the GDPR, standard protection measures in relation to the “Protection” of personal and work devices, the “Security” of e-mail messages, the “Proper Management” of passwords and the “Transfer” of data securely, as reflected in the “Cybersecurity Policy” and its “Implementation”, as well as “Additional” measures, which are taken to reduce the possibility of security breaches. (16) In particular, “technical and organizational measures to control and limit access to data only to authorized users at any given time” are complied with, as follows: A. In accordance with the “Cybersecurity Policy”, the N.D. applies “Technical Measures” to limit access to data and for information security. Indicatively: Role-Based Access Control: “Domain Controllers” and “Definition” of roles with specific access rights. Assigning rights to users and groups based on their roles. Activity Recording and Monitoring: Systems for recording and monitoring data access activities (Security Information and Event Management-SIEM) for detecting and analyzing unauthorized attempts to access data. Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems. USB Lock. Use of Secure Communication Protocols (e.g. HTTPS, SSL/TLS): Ensuring that network communications are encrypted and secure. Databases, CRM, File Servers with graded access based on roles. EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) systems for identifying, analyzing, responding to and replacing threats in real time. SOC (Security Operations Center) system and team to monitor, detect, analyze and respond to information security incidents on a 24-hour basis. B. Organizational Measures. Risk Management: ‒ Conduct annual risk assessments to identify and address potential threats to data security with “Penetration Tests” and comply with any findings. – Access Review and Control: Regularly review access rights to ensure compliance with security policies and implement security measures for new employees and executives, change of roles and departure to prevent unauthorized access. Implementation and Implementation of a Data Transfer Policy to Citizens via an online request-platform and a maximum processing duration of 30 days. C. Internal compliance measures which include: Confidentiality agreements for party staff and associates. Training: Regular training seminars for party staff and executives on best security practices, access policies and the "Personal Data Processing Policy". Certification with a quality management system (ISO 9001) with a certification scope of "Organization and operation for the support and service of party members and bodies", in order to ensure compliance with relevant regulatory, legislative and contractual requirements. Planning of annual inspections for compliance with any findings and implementation of improvements. Furthermore, with the memorandum dated 26.7.2024 to the ΑΠΔΠΧ (Γ/ΕΙΣ/... /26.7.2024) the N.D. developed and explained the aforementioned measures, and added the following by providing relevant documents: a) In accordance with the "Cybersecurity Policy" the N.D. implements (in addition to the aforementioned) Technical Measures to restrict access to data and information security, namely: email server protection systems (firewall, antispam), database protection with access only from specific "VLANS" or "VPN", blocking access by unauthorized users, use of "Canary Tokens" for automatic notifications in the event of a violation of access to classified folders on the File Server with personal data and implementation of a “Bring your own device-BYOD” policy, which makes it impossible to access servers with personal data, as well as the party’s databases. b) With the continuous use of the available tools of the Technical Measures for limiting access to data and information security, which it has taken since 2020 and onwards, N.D. has, among other things, made 1034 total transfers to executives and politicians from the party’s online platform and official domain and email and 15 total transfers specifically to the Secretariat for Expatriates following requests from June 2021 to November 2023. c) In connection with internal compliance measures and in particular in relation to requests for data transfer from the Member Registry, N.D. has held twenty-seven (27) training seminars (the thematic subjects of which are listed in the documents attached to the above memorandum) and nine (9) training presentations on the personal data processing policy. These are regular training seminars for party personnel and executives on best practices for the use of IT tools, security policies, access policies and the "Personal Data Processing Policy", which were addressed to employees, party Secretariats and Secretariat Executives, Executives of local organizations (DEEP/DIMTO) and Members of the Parliamentary Group, with participants, among others, Secretaries and Secretariat Executives.  With the above memorandum, the requesting political party argued that "since the implementation of the specific measures, no violation/leakage of personal data has been detected or reported, which proves that the methodology of the technical and organizational measures of New Democracy has had excellent results". It also provided the "provided Confidentiality Agreements" by category of contracting parties (for Associated Persons through statute, employment relationship, internship, etc., for Party Secretaries, for External Collaborators, etc.). Furthermore, the document "Cybersecurity Policy" of the New Democracy, which was submitted by the requesting political party to the Authority for the Protection of Personal Information (incoming document G/... / 16.4.2024 - see also the relevant transmission document with no. prot. 297/21.1.2025 of the Authority to the Court), states, among other things, the following: "Subject of the Cybersecurity Policy. This Cybersecurity Policy (hereinafter the "Policy") applies to all employees, contractors, volunteers, associates, executives and in general to those who have permanent or temporary access to the information systems and logistical infrastructure of New Democracy (hereinafter the "Legitimate Users"). ... Implementation of the Cybersecurity Policy. ... Protection of personal and work devices. When Authorized Users use their digital devices (Bring Your Own Device) to access the Email that may have been granted to them by Nea Dimokratia or their accounts in Nea Dimokratia's information systems, they may introduce risks to the data. Nea Dimokratia recommends that Authorized Users maintain the security of their digital devices (laptop, tablet, mobile phone/smartphone) \[and\] in particular to: Keep all their devices password-protected, Install and/or upgrade full antivirus software, Ensure that they do not leave their devices exposed or unattended, Install security updates for browsers and systems monthly, Connect to Nea Dimokratia's accounts and systems only through secure and private networks... Transfer data securely. Data transfer is a risk to their security, for this reason it is generally prohibited within the information systems of Nea Dimokratia. In any case, Legal Users must: Avoid transferring any personal data (e.g. Member information, Citizen files) to other devices or accounts, unless absolutely necessary, and necessarily with prior written approval of the IT Department, Share confidential data via the Nea Dimokratia network/system and not via public Wi-Fi or private connection, Ensure that the recipients of the data are appropriately authorized people or organizations and that they have adequate security policies...”. 13. Because, in accordance with what was set out in the main point (no. 11), the judgment of the APDPH regarding the inadequacy of the technical and organizational measures taken by N.D., due to which it was fined 30,000 euros and the obligation to remedy the deficiencies identified, is inadequately justified for the following reasons: (A) The applicant political party invoked before the Authority, as analytically set out in the previous point, the measures of a technical and organizational nature that it had taken and which concerned i) the planning and limitation of the processing of personal data only to the data necessary for the respective processing purpose (article 25 paras. 1 and 2 of the GDPR), and ii) the security of the processing against risks and the relevant supervision of users (article 32 paras. 1 and 4 of the GDPR), namely measures relating to: a) the determination of specific recipients and categories of data (especially data of party executives, members and friends) that are subject to processing, b) the restriction of access to the information systems of the New Democracy. only to specific persons/authorized users and administrative units (Information Technology Directorate) of the party, c) the use of secure connections (VLAN/VPN), d) the blocking of access to the databases of other administrative units of the party, e) the prohibition of transferring data to private devices without prior permission from the Information Technology Directorate, f) the systematic recording of communications and security events, g) the use of automated notifications for relevant violations, h) educational actions for party executives, etc. However, the Authority did not specifically assess the nature and content of these measures based on the aforementioned suitability criteria nor whether and to what extent they were capable of mitigating – and in any case not eliminating – the risks to personal data, the processing of which was the responsibility of the New Democracy. (B) Both from the content of the “Cybersecurity Policy” of the N.D., as well as from the other elements and data that N.D. invoked before the APDPH, it follows that the party Secretariats were in no way exempted from any of the technical and organizational measures (recommendations, prohibitions, educational actions) taken by the applicant political party. Therefore, the APDPH's admission that the technical and organizational measures taken by N.D. "do not include the processing activities of its Secretariats", without a specific examination and evaluation of N.D.'s allegations regarding the universal and without exceptions to their recipients nature of the measures taken, is similarly inadequately justified. (C) The Authority accepted that the “policies \[of N.D.\] in relation to data and personal devices (BYOD) are incomplete and limited to its internal network ... because, as emerged from the case file, a significant part of the activities is carried out from personal devices of party executives, for which there is no provision in relation to the control of personal data that may be processed on them”. Furthermore, that “a violation arises ... because by design \[N.D.\] left party organs and personnel, who ... process personal data, without substantial supervision or guidance”. However, the explicit and imperative recommendation of the N.D.’s “Cybersecurity Policy”, which is crucial for the above issue, was not assessed. to all "Legitimate Users" of the party's information systems and logistical infrastructures to avoid transferring any personal data to other devices or accounts outside the information systems of N.D., unless absolutely necessary and this "necessarily" with prior written approval of the party's IT Department, this in conjunction with the applicant political party's claim that no relevant breach of personal data was found. (D) The contested decision refers to a complete lack of provision in relation to the control of personal data that "may" be processed during the performance of activities using the personal devices of party executives. The above, however, finding \[besides not clarifying whether and under what conditions such control could, possibly, be extended to private communications of party officials or be excluded, since these are private communications, nor under what conditions would it be ensured that the relevant controls do not conflict with the absolute inviolability of communications pursuant to article 19 par. 1 in conjunction with article 25 par. 1, third sentence of the Constitution\] does not specify a) which personal data it refers to, for the processing of which the New Democracy is responsible, so that it is obliged under article 32 par. 4 of the GDPR to take specific control measures for persons acting under its supervision, b) nor whether the technical measures taken to limit and control (preventive and repressive) users' access to its information systems, as the requesting political party presented them to the Authority, were capable of mitigating the risks to the above data, even in the event of the use of personal devices by its executives. (E) From the Authority's more specific finding, according to which "it has not been proven that in practice the party Secretaries sign a confidentiality agreement text ... since no corresponding signed confidentiality agreement between the party and \[N.Th.\] and/or \[A.K.\] was submitted to the Authority by any party", it does not follow, however, that the failure to sign a confidentiality agreement revokes the validity and binding nature of the technical and organizational measures taken for the Secretaries and other obligated persons (party executives, etc.). Therefore, the mere failure to sign a confidentiality agreement does not justify the overall characterization of the measures in question as insufficient or inappropriate for safeguarding the lawfulness and security of the processing of personal data. (F) Finally, the assumptions of some of the members of the APDPH, according to which: (aa) the lack of a data protection policy, as well as the absence of practical control rules, facilitated the established unlawful collection, internal circulation and maintenance of the file in question by the t. Secretary for Overseas Persons, but also its use for the original purpose of the file (statistical analysis of election results); and (bb) the N.D., even after becoming aware of the controlled incident, but also after establishing that two party bodies were involved in the said "illegal trafficking" of personal data, did not proceed with a thorough investigation of the conditions under which the disputed data processing took place by persons acting under its supervision and did not take appropriate actions in order to examine the possible need to take further measures, do not constitute a lawful and sufficient justification for the contested decision. This is because, on the one hand, according to what was set out in the main point (paragraph 11), the mere finding of a certain personal data breach is not sufficient to establish the inadequacy of the measures taken; on the other hand, the aforementioned assumptions, which presuppose that the above processing took place within the N.D., have been shaken following what was accepted above (paragraph 10). Consequently, according to the valid arguments in the relevant ground for annulment, the contested decision must be annulled in so far as it imposes on the applicant political party a fine of 30,000 euros for breach of articles 25 par. 1 and 32 of the GDPR, as well as the related obligation to remedy the deficiencies found in the procedures for the protection of personal data.

14. Whereas, State Counselor O. Zygoura dissented, arguing the following: It follows from the contested act of the Authority that the disputed fines were imposed against the applicant on the grounds that the Secretaries, through whom – as is not disputed – the aforementioned archives were transferred to the AMA, were organs of the applicant according to its statute, and this processing took place within the framework of their responsibilities and for the purposes of the party. Furthermore, according to what was accepted by the Authority, it did not emerge that these persons had received specific instructions regarding data processing, there was a lack of instructions regarding their precise responsibilities and the manner of fulfilling their duties, while it was not proven that the said Secretaries had concluded confidentiality agreements with the applicant, since these were not submitted to the Authority. Under these circumstances, legally in view of what is set out above in paragraphs 5, 9, 11 and with legal justification, it was accepted by the respondent Authority that the violations attributed to the applicant were committed and the claims to the contrary raised in the present application are rejected. State Counselor I. also dissented. Symplis, who argued the following: The real basis of the violation attributed to the New Democracy party (and this is not disputed), is that specific persons under its supervision, of course abusing their status and the relationship of trust with the political party in question, but, nevertheless, on the occasion and thanks to the access to sources of personal data that their status provided them, proceeded to the illegal collection, processing, and further disposal of such data. The inadequate supervision attributed to the political party in question is precisely that, having the belief that it can and must have unlimited trust in the persons under its supervision, it has established procedures and security rules only against malicious attempts by third parties to gain access to the personal data that have lawfully come into the party's possession, and not against any kind of malicious actions by the persons under its supervision. In fact, on this issue in particular, the New Democracy party does not even seem to have put forward any specific claim in the application under consideration. The failure of this party to impose on the persons under its supervision the obligation to sign a confidentiality agreement (which is specifically invoked in the Authority's decision) constitutes precisely a nuanced indication, which, in the absence of another, at least reasonable, alternative explanation, allows the inference of a judicial presumption that the political party in question acted precisely under the perception that the bonds of trust that traditionally govern in Greece the relations between political parties and their executives allow (if not impose!) the absence of control mechanisms for the latter. However, this is not the perception that underlies the GDPR, which does not distinguish between political parties, on the one hand, which are not obliged to establish procedures for protection against the risk of malicious conduct of persons under their supervision, and other categories of entities, on the other hand, which, on the contrary, are not in dispute as having such an obligation. Given these facts, there is no question of further examining whether any measures that could have been taken would have been appropriate and relevant to mitigate the risk in question.

15. Since, following the above, the application under consideration must be accepted, the contested decision 38/2024 of the ADAPC in the part that concerns the N.D. should be annulled and the interventions made should be rejected. On the other hand, it is understood that, having annulled the administrative act due to inadequate reasoning, as in this case, the competent authority may, in principle, return to the matter by duly justifying the relevant act.
