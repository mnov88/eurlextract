## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject realised that their neighbour (controller) installed surveillance cameras that were monitoring their private garden. They considered that the monitoring was violating the Spanish data protection law (Art.22 LOPDGDD) in force.

The data subject therefore filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA recalled that image of a person, according to [article 4.1 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR"), is a personal data and its protection is, therefore, subject of this Regulation. The concept of "processing" of personal data is defined in Article 4.2 of the GDPR. Article 22 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish national data protection law: Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos Personales y Garantía de los Derechos Digitales BOE-A-2018-11673) sets out the specific rules for the processing of data for video surveillance purposes and stating that natural or legal persons, may carry out the processing of images through camera or video camera systems for the purpose of preserving the security of persons and property, as well as of their installations. However, images may only be captured from the public insofar as it is essential for these security reasons.

Against this background the DPA holds that Video cameras may not capture images of persons who are outside the private space where the video surveillance system is installed, since the processing of images in public places can only be carried out by the Security Forces and Corps.

In the prersent case, the DPA found that there were no security reasons that justified the monitoring of a private garden.

This rule admits some exceptions since, on some occasions, for the protection of private spaces, where cameras have been installed on façades or in the or inside, it may be necessary, in order to guarantee the security purpose, to record a portion of the  public road. In other words, cameras and video cameras installed for security purposes may not obtain images from the public roadway

In view of the foregoing, the facts imply a violation of the provisions of article 5.1 c) of the article 5.1 c) of the RGPD, which implies an infringement typified in article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, which provides as follows:
"Infringements of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance with the paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of an undertaking, an amount equivalent to 4% of the total annual aggregate turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher:

established in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;
(...) V
The corrective powers available to the Spanish Data Protection Agency, as supervisory authority, are set forth in Article 58.2 of the GDPR. Among the powers to impose an administrative fine in accordance with Article 83 of the GDPR - Article 58.2 i) of the GDPR , or the power to order the controller or processor to that the processing operations comply with the provisions of the GDPR, where applicable, in a specified manner and within a specified period of time - Article 58.2 (i).
According to Article 83(2) of the GDPR, the measure provided for in Article 58(2)(d) of the GDPR is compatible with the provisions of the GDPR.
In the present case, in view of the facts, it is considered that the sanction that should be imposed is an administrative fine. The fine to be imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with Article 83.1 of the GDPR. In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR must be observed.
The provision of Article 83.2 of the GDPR states:
"2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or in substitution of the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:
(a) the nature, extent or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects concerned and the number of data subjects concerned and the level of damage they have suffered; 
(b) the number of data subjects concerned and the level of damage they have suffered;
b) the intent or negligence of the infringement;
(c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered; 
(d) the extent of the responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures implemented by them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32
(e) any previous infringement committed by the controller or processor;
(f) the extent of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the breach and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the breach;
(g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;
(h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach to the supervisory authority.
(i) where the measures referred to in Article 58(2) have been ordered in advance against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;
(j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved under Article 42,
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefit gained or loss avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement".
For its part, in relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its article 76, "Sanctions and penalties for infringement", states
Article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:
"1. The sanctions provided for in Article 83(4), (5) and (6) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the graduation criteria laid down in paragraph 2 of the aforementioned Article.
2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83(2)(k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 the following may also be taken into account:
(a) The continuing nature of the infringement.
b) The linking of the offender's activity with the processing of personal data.
c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the infringement.
d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have been included in the commission of the infringement.
e) The existence of a process of merger by absorption subsequent to the infringement, which cannot be imputed to the absorbing entity.
f) The involvement of the rights of minors.
g) The availability, when not mandatory, of a data protection officer.
h) The submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to alternative
dispute resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which there are disputes between them and any data subject".
The balance of the circumstances contemplated, with regard to the infringement committed
by violating the provisions of articles 5.1 c) of the GDPR, allows to set a fine of 300 (three hundred euros). Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having taken into account the criteria for the graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been accredited, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
FIRST: IMPOSE on B.B.B., with Tax ID \*\*\*NIF.1, for an infringement of Article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, as typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, a fine of 300 (three hundred euros).
SECOND: TO ORDER B.B.B., with tax identification number \*\*\*NIF.1 that, by virtue of Article 58.2.d)
of the RGPD, within ten working days, to adopt the following measures:
- Prove to have proceeded to the removal of the devices in question by providing
