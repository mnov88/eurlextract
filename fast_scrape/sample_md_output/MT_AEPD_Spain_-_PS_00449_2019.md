## English Summary

### Facts

On 23/05/2019 it was published in the newspaper "Segre" that the Medical Association of Lleida is investigating a possible breach of ethics for the use of medical data to send advertising of a political party in an election campaign.

On 26/06/2019 the claimant filed a complaint denouncing that he had received advertising from the political party "PARTIT DELS SOCIALISTES DE CATALUNYA (PSC-PSOE)" addressed to a ceased relative and who was a patient of a doctor related to the denounced political party.

The political party states that the doctor, who had run in the municipal elections and was a counselor at the Town Hall, brought boxes with sealed envelopes. The administrative staff of the Political Party proceeded to send them.

### Dispute

Is it a violation of Article 5 GDPR to send election advertising to citizens using data arising from the doctor-patient relationship?

### Holding

The AEPD considered that the conduct of the defendant's employees - the sending of electoral publicity using personal data from a patient-doctor relationship - infringes Article 5.1 b) of the RGPD, an infringement punishable under Article 83 (4) (a) GDPR.

Assessing the circumstances that modify the responsibility contemplated in Article 83 (2) GDPR, in this case, the aggravating circumstances for being a non-intentional but significant negligent action (Article 83 (2) (b) GDPR), and for being data known as basic personal identifiers such as name and address (83 (2) (g) GDPR).

The AEPD set the amount of the administrative fine at €5000 (five thousand euros).

## Comment

The decision was notified on 14 August to the respondent, who lodged an appeal for reconsideration on 15 September 2020. The AEPD refused to admit the appeal due to its late presentation, justifying its action in the case law of the Audiencia Nacional and the Supreme Court.

This jurisprudence established that when the deadline is from month to month, the period begins on the day after the notification and ends on the same day of the notification of the following month.

The grounds for the complaint are the receipt of a letter addressed to a family member of the claimant asking for political support for the Socialist Party candidate.
This letter was headed by B.B.B., a specialist in general and digestive surgery.

LEGAL FOUNDATIONS
I
The Director of the Agency is competent to resolve this procedure Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of Article 58.2 of the RGPD and in articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD.
II
## Article 4(1) of the GPRS defines personal data as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("the data subject"); it shall be considered identifiable natural person means any person whose identity can be established, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as a name an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more elements of that person's physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity.

Article 4.2) of the RGPD defines "processing" as "any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or sets of personal data, whether by automated procedures or not, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, preservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or any other form of enabling access, matching or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction".
In this way, personal data are considered to be processed from when personal data is communicated or disseminated.
Article 6.1 of the RGPD states that "in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, consent of the affected party is understood as any free, specific, informed and unequivocal expression of will by the that he accepts, either by a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data concerning him".
For its part, Article 5 of the RGPD establishes that the personal data will be 
"(a) processed in a lawful, fair and transparent manner in relation to the data subject ("legality, fairness and transparency");
(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not treated subsequently in a manner incompatible with those purposes; in accordance with Article 89, paragraph 1, further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific and historical research or for statistical purposes shall not be considered incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");
(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for those who are processed ("data minimization");
(d) accurate and, where necessary, updated; all measures shall be taken to delete or rectify without delay personal data that are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are intended ("accuracy");
(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of the processing of the personal data; personal data may be kept for longer periods provided
that are processed exclusively for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89, paragraph 1, without prejudice to the application of the appropriate technical and organizational measures required by this Regulation to protect the rights and freedoms of the person concerned ("limitation of retention period");
(f) processed in a way that ensures appropriate security for the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing; and against their accidental loss, destruction or damage, by implementing measures appropriate techniques or organizational arrangements ("integrity and confidentiality").
The controller shall be responsible for compliance with the provisions of paragraph 1 and capable of demonstrating it ("proactive responsibility")".
III
In accordance with the evidence available here at the time of the sanctioning procedure, it is considered that it has been accredited that the defendant has used the data provided by B.B.B., a leading physician in the
to send a letter to a relative of the claimant, asking for his or her support political party, when standing for election on the political party's list claimed, which is clearly a different purpose for which these statements were given data, which was none other than the one between a patient and his doctor.
These facts are accredited by the newspaper www.segre.com, in its publication of \*\*\*DATE.1, following the link: \*\*\*URL.1. In addition, it has also been noted that it was from the party headquarters since where the electoral propaganda letters with the patients' data were sent provided by the aforementioned doctor.
The defendant is therefore charged with an infringement of Article 5.1(b) of the GPRS, which governs the principle of purpose limitation, as well as the proactive responsibility of the controller to demonstrate his
compliance.
IV
Article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD states that "in accordance with the provisions Article 83(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and will expire after three years if they substantially infringe the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following articles:
Processing of personal data in breach of the principles and guarantees laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
V
## Article 58(2) of the GDPR provides: "Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers listed below:

(b) to sanction any controller or person in charge of the processing with warning where processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation;
(d) instruct the controller or processor to ensure that the processing operations treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within a specified time frame;
(i) impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each individual case;
VI
This infringement is punishable by a fine of up to or, in the case of an undertaking, of an amount not exceeding 4% of its total annual turnover in the preceding financial year, in which case in accordance with article 83.5 of the GDPR.
Likewise, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be graduated in accordance with

The following are aggravating factors:
In the present case, we are dealing with unintentional but significant negligent action (Article 83.2 b)
Basic personal identifiers (name, surname, address) are affected, according to Article 83(2)(g)
VII
