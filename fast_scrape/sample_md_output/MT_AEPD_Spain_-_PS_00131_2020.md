## English Summary

### Facts

A group of workers at a educational centre filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against their regional Department for Public Education and Universities.

The Department was in the process of implementing a biometric identification system for their workers. Such system was meant to be a voluntary way of identification for the teachers of the centre.

### Holding

The AEPD found that the controller had not properly informed the workers about the biometric system. When the workers asked about the information listed under Article 13 GDPR, they only received a generic answer saying that the personal data were being processed in accordance with the data protection law, and that the contracts made with the providers of the service were also compliant.

The AEPD noted that the processing was not illegal. The controller had a legal basis for the processing (the performance of a contract), and was also relying in one of the exceptions from Article 9(2) GDPR, required for the processing of special categories of data: the processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment. Such obligations originate in the [Spanish Workers' Statute](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-11430); its Article 20(3) allows the employer to use different methods of control and surveillance to verify that the employee effectively complies with their duties and obligations.

However, the AEPD remarked that neither the information provided to the workers nor the answer to their latter request for such information were appropriate, specially in light of a processing of personal data of a sensitive nature, such as biometric data.

The AEPD therefore concluded that the controller had violated Article 13 GDPR, by not providing the information listed by the Article to their workers. The AEPD only issued a warning to the controller.

The authority took into account the actions that the controller took during the course of the proceeding to mitigate the infringement: the stopped the processing and the use of the system, they deleted all the collected data, and they compromised to involve the DPO in further similar projects, as well as to carry out a data protection impact assessment and to devise new data protection protocols.
