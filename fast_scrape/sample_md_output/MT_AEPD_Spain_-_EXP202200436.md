## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject used to be an employee of the controller. The data subject claimed that there had been three automatic withdrawals from her bank account without its consent. The data subject stated that the controller used the money from these withdrawals to pay for an external service from a third party, the SGAE, a non-profit focused on the defense and collective management of copyright. The data subject stated that this would explain how the controller got the details of its back-account. The controller didn’t reply to questions and information-requests of the DPA. The data subject filed a complaint at the Spanish DPA.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller had violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") because the controller had processed the data subject’s personal data without their authorisation. The controller used the bank-account of the data subject to debit the account of the data subject without being able to prove the legitimacy of this processing of personal data. The DPA fined the controller €3000 for this lack of a legal basis for processing.
