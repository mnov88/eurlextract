## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the union representative of the defendant had openly published an electoral census list (which was exclusive of the union and contained personal data such as the ID numbers of all voters considered regular staff) in an open WhatsApp group (in which almost all the workers of the radiodiagnosis Madrid central unit are included).

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the first AEPD investigation requests stating that: (i) it considered that the data publication was legally covered by the Spanish law on public workers elections, (ii) the publication was made during a legal elections process and due to the request of several members of the WhatsApp group (in which the claimant was included), as they had some difficulties to access the intranet of the union in which such data were already published. The defendant also answered to the subsequent evidence investigation requests by the AEPD stating that: (i) the resolution proposal is not doing an adequate balance of the right to union freedom and the right to the data protection, (ii) there is public interest and legitimate interest in the data processing made by the publication of such data, as it was in the interest of the workers, (iii) there has never been a lack of responsibility in the acts of the union representative, (iv) all the members at the WhatsApp group accessed such information voluntarily, including the claimant, as they are also included in such electoral census list, (v) the communication area claimed is less than other publication media used by the electoral census, (vi) the union is concerned about data protection, and so it contracted the corresponding law firm in order to ensure a full compliance of the regulation, (vii) the claimant avoided to use the reporting channels offered by the defendant. After the investigation process, the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure, and understood that: (i) the processing activity consisting of the publication of the personal data would only be legal if its covered by Article 6(1) GDPR, (ii) with basis on several other Spanish regulations, (such as the Worker's Statute, the Spanish law on public workers elections, the Spanish law on private workers elections) there is neither a legal basis to do such publication in the way it has been made, as it shall be made by the polling station at the notice board, (iii) the publication cannot be legally covered by the legitimate interest neither, as the specific personal data published by the union representative were excessive to the alleged purpose, (iv) regarding the balance over data protection right and union freedom right, the union was never obliged to do such publication, so it significantly surpassed the boundaries of Spanish labour law to that respect.

The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed the integrity and confidentiality principle included at Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. Consequently, after considering some circumstances \[(i) the local scope of the processing activity made by the defendant, (ii) the number of persons affected by the processing activity, (iii) there is no evidence that the defendant has adopted any measures in order to prevent such issues to happen again in the future, (iv) there is no evidence of wilful misconduct by the defendant, even being this issue a very serious breach of the law, (v) the link between the activity of the defendant and the processing of personal data, and (vi) the defendant has not the consideration of big company, despite it represents a big number of public workers throughout the country\], the AEPD decided to impose a fine of 3,000 € to the defendant.

5/12Nor will there be legal protection for the publication of the data in the form inthat has been carried out, through an open group of WhatsApp.The Workers' Statute in its article 74, Functions of the Board , statesthat “In the case of elections to members of the works council, thepolling station will request the employer for the labor census and will draw up, with themeans that it will provide him, the list of voters. This will be made public innotice boards by exposing them for a period of no less than seventy-fivetwo hours".On the other hand, article 6.2 of Royal Decree 1844/1994, of September 9,by which the Regulations for elections to Representative Bodies ofWorkers in the Company provide that: “In the elections for Delegates ofStaff and members of the Company Committee, communicated to the company the purposeto hold elections for their promoters, this, within seven days, will givetransfer of said communication to the workers who must constitute the table and inthe same term will send the constituents of the polling station the labor census,with an indication of the workers who meet the age and seniority requirements, inthe terms of article 69.2 of the Workers' Statute, precise to showthe status of voters and eligible.The polling station will make public, among workers, the labor census withindication of who are voters and eligible in accordance with article 69.2 of theWorkers' Statute, which will be considered for voting purposes as a listof voters.In the case of elections for Works Councils, the list of voters andeligible will be made public on the notice boards for a period of no less thanseventy-two hours ..Also the Regulation of elections of the personnel at the service of thePublic Administrations approved by Royal Decree 1846/1994, of 9 DecemberSeptember in its article 14, Electoral Census , establishes:"one. The Administration will refer the officials who should constitute the tableelectoral coordinator or, where appropriate, to the single electoral table the census ofofficials adjusted to the standard model, within twelve business daysfrom receipt of the election promotion letter.In the aforementioned census, the name, two surnames, sex, date will be recordedof birth, national identity document and seniority recognized in thepublic function, of all officials of the electoral unit.2.

In the same period, it will determine the number ofC / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es

6/12representatives to be elected in the electoral unit, in accordance withArticles 5 and 8 of Law 9/1987.(…)And in its article 18 "Elections to Personnel Delegates", it states that:"one. In the case of elections to Personnel Delegates, the managing bodyof personnel, within the same period of article 7 of these Regulations, will send thecomponents of the polling station census of officials, which will be adjusted, to theseeffects, to normalized model.2. The polling station will fulfill the following functions:a) Make the census public among the officials indicating who they arevoters.b) Set the number of representatives and the deadline for the presentation ofcandidacies.(…) "In view of the transcribed precepts, there is no legal basis for publicationof the data in the form in which it has been made, names and surnames together with the number ofDNI, through an open group of whatsapp in which the majority ofthe workers of the Central Radiodiagnosis Unit of the Community ofMadrid.Who has the responsibility to publish the census data is the BureauElectoral and the aforementioned publication must be made on the notice board so thatcan be endorsed by voters in order to rectify possible errors.And this publication on the board does not violate the legislation on protectionof personal data. Finally, it must be said that the RGPD does notexpress mention of this particular particular, therefore, does not modify the legislationhad to date.The complainant considers that the basis that legitimizes the processing of the data of theclaimant is in the legitimate interest, that is, that the treatment ofpersonal data made through the publication on the social network watsappIt sought to satisfy the exercise of the right to freedom of association.Now, this requires that the pursued interests do not prevail over theinterests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party that require theprotection of personal data, that is, it requires weighing the interests at staketo conclude whether or not the right to freedom of association should prevail or notof the claimant to their privacy.Regarding legitimate interest as a legal basis for data processingpersonal data of third parties, Recital 47 of the RGPD says:<< The legitimate interest of a data controller, including that of aresponsible to whom personal data may be communicated, or of a third party, mayconstitute a legal basis for the treatment, provided that theinterests or the rights and freedoms of the interested party, taking into account thereasonable expectations of stakeholders based on their relationship to theresponsable. Such a legitimate interest could occur, for example, when there is a relationshiprelevant and appropriate between the data subject and the controller, such as in situationsC / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es

7/12those that the interested party is a client or is at the service of the person in charge. In any case,the existence of a legitimate interest would require a careful assessment, even ifa data subject can reasonably foresee, at the time and in the context of thecollection of personal data, which may be processed for this purpose. InIn particular, the interests and fundamental rights of the interested party couldprevail over the interests of the data controller when proceeding to theprocessing of personal data in circumstances in which the interested party does notreasonably expect further treatment to take place. Since it correspondsthe legislator establish by law the legal basis for the processing of personal databy public authorities, this legal basis should not apply to thetreatment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.
