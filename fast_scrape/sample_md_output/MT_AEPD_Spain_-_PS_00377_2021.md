## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject, an employee of the Municipality, filed a complaint with the AEPD because of a video surveillance system that recorded employees and citizens actions within the Municipality's premises, even though no proper authorisation was requested and granted. Moreover, since the cameras could also record audio, personal conversations of employees and visitors could be recorded. Lastly, although there was a sign that informed visitors and employees of the presence video surveillance cameras, it was unclear for which purpose these cameras were installed. The AEPD informed the Municipality (hereafter: respondent) regarding the complaint but never got a reply. Hence, it agreed to process the complaint.

### Holding

The AEPD upheld the complaint.

First, the recording of personal conversations is an invasion of privacy. This is therefore strictly forbidden and can lead to a violation of [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR").

Second, the cameras must be limited to the purpose for which they are intended. Also, the way of capturing and processing this data must be proportionate in relation to this purpose (surveillance/security).

Third, the AEPD recalls that, in order to comply with [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR"), a clear sign must be placed in a visible area (e.g. access door) indicating that it is a video-surveilled area, and it must indicate:

*   the existence of the processing.

*   the identity of the data controller.

*   the possibility of exercising the rights provided for in Articles 15 to 22 GDPR.

If there is not a clear sign informing employees of the video-surveillance area, which provides this information, this leads to a violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). Respondent had failed to install and show a clear sign that provided this information. Moreover, the purpose of security had not been known to the legal representatives of all the public employees of the aforementioned entity, although they must be aware of the purpose(s) of the images obtained. Hence, this constituted an infringement, attributable to the respondent, for violation of Articles 5(1)(c) and 13 GDPR.

Therefore, the AEPD (1) imposed a warning on the Municipality and (2) ordered respondent to:

*   Place information signs duly approved to the current GDPR at the main entrances to the Town Hall within one month of the decision.
*   Inform all public employees of the measures adopted, in particular those related to the purpose(s) of the processing.
*   To place the entrance camera so that it is used for the security function of the Town Hall, but avoids capturing the work area of the employees exclusively, disabling the audio option if necessary.

## Comment

1. In its decision, the AEPD mentioned _"exception of prior judicial authorisation and recordings made by persons competent to do so in "exceptional" situations"_ as grounds for exception to the prohibition of the recording of personal conversations. However, this was not further explained.

2. It is likely, however, that the AEPD referred to Article 5 [Ley Orgánica 4/1997, de 4 de agosto, por la que se regula la utilización de videocámaras por las Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad en lugares públicos](https://boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1997-17574).
