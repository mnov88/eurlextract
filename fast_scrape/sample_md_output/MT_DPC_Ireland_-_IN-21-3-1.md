## English Summary

### Facts

This case concerns two requests from an Airbnb customer (the data subject) to Airbnb Ireland UC (the controller); an access request under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and an erasure request under [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"). Regarding the erasure request specifically, when the complainant submitted the request on 17 August 2019, they were asked to verify their identity by providing a copy of their photographic ID. After the complainant refused to provide a copy of their ID, the controller offered them the alternative option of logging into their account to verify their identity. Once the complainant had logged in to confirm their identity, Airbnb advised them that it had initiated their request and, on 24 October 2019, confirmed that the relevant data had been deleted.

The complainant raised a number of issues regarding the handling of their requests by Airbnb. Firstly, there was no lawful basis for requesting a copy of the complainant’s ID for the right to erasure request. Secondly, the complainant alleged that Airbnb failed to properly respond to the erasure request. Thirdly, the controller failed to respond to the access request.

The complaint was originally filed with the Berlin DPA, who referred the case to the Irish DPA under article 56 GDPR, and in accordance with the procedure outlined in [Article 60 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR "Article 60 GDPR").

Responding to the first issue (lawfulness of ID request), Airbnb initially noted that merely a “request” to provide ID cannot be considered “processing” within the meaning of [Article 4(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#2 "Article 4 GDPR"), as “receipt of or access to” the relevant personal data is required. Furthermore, Airbnb stated that its identity verification procedures are in place to protect the Airbnb platform and its users, in doing so they stressed the risk of fraudulent activity, and stated there is evidence that bad actors use GDPR requests to do harm, deceiving the platform and its users. As such, photo ID verification is a reliable form of proof of identity and a secure authentication method to combat these risks. Accordingly, the collection of this data is lawful in accordance with the “legitimate interest” basis in [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR").

With regards to the handling of the erasure request itself, the second issue, Airbnb advised that the deletion of an account is a highly technical process, and it could not confirm the exact date this process was completed. However, it was later confirmed that Airbnb emailed the complainant on 24 October 2019 confirming the deletion of the complainant’s personal data.

On the third issue (the access request), Airbnb advised that a review of the documentation indicated that the request was received by Airbnb on 24 October 2019, however this was “regretfully mishandled/misinterpreted” by one of their agents. This was brought to their attention when the complainant followed up on the request on 8 November 2019, however, by this point the account had been deleted and the controller was only able to provide a “post-deletion access file” on 17 July 2020.

### Holding

Following its examination and assessment of the complaint, the DPC held as follows.

Regarding the first issue (whether the controller had a lawful basis for the ID request) the DPC stated that, firstly, making photographic ID a mandatory requirement for submitting an erasure request does constitute processing for the purposes of [Article 4(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#2 "Article 4 GDPR"). In addition, while the processing of photo ID may be required in some circumstances, Airbnb did not demonstrate that the ID request was either proportionate or necessary in the context of an erasure request. Therefore, it could not be considered that a “legitimate interest” exists for the processing of data and so the controller had infringed [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"), in addition to violating the principle of data minimisation in [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR").

Concerning the second issue of the controller’s handling of the erasure request, the DPC advised that, once the complainant verified their identity by logging into their account on 2 September 2019, the erasure of the account was commenced the same day and confirmed to have been completed on 24 October 2019. Accordingly, there was no undue delay in handling the request for erasure and the controller did not infringe upon [Article 17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR").

Finally, the DPC addressed the controller’s obligations under article 12 GDPR regarding both the handling of the erasure and access request. The DPC found no violation regarding the erasure request. However, they found that a considerable delay arose between the date in which Airbnb received the access request on 24 October 2019 and the supply of the post-deletion access file on 17 July 2020, contrary to the requirement to comply with the request within a period of one month (Article 12(3)). Accordingly, the controller infringed [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR") with respect to its handling of the access request.

Regarding the exercise of corrective powers, the DPC considered the imposition of an administrative fine in accordance with the factors set out in [Article 83(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2 "Article 83 GDPR"). They concluded that a fine would not be necessary, proportionate or dissuasive and that the delay in handling the access request did not arise due to a systemic set of issues but was particular to the circumstances of the case. Accordingly, the DPC did not administer a fine, and instead, made an order requiring Airbnb to bring its activities into compliance with the GDPR.

Complaint
Handling
by
the
DPC
— Timeline
and
Summary
1. The complaint
was
initially
lodged
with the
Berlin
DPA
and thereafter
transmitted
to
the
DPC,
on 06
March
2020, via
the
IMI
to
be
handled
by
the
DPC
in
its
role aslead
supervisory
authority.
The
complainant
alleged
that
Airbnb
failed
to
properly
respond
to
an
erasure
request
submitted
by
them,
via
email
on
17 August
2019, pursuant
to
Article
17 of
the
GDPR.
Further,
the
complainant
stated
that
when
they
submitted
their
request
for
erasure,
Airbnb
requested
that
they
verify
their
identity
by
providing
a
photocopy
of
their
identity
document
(“ID”),
which
they
had
not
previously provided
to
Airbnb.
The
complainant
refused
to
provide
a
copy
of
their
ID
and
Airbnb
then
provided
them
with the
option
of
logging
into
their
account
to
verify
their identity.
Upon
logging
into
their
account
to
verify
their identity,
Airbnb
advised
the
complainant
that
it
had
initiated their
deletion
request
and.would
delete
all
data
to
the
extent
that
## GDPR

permits
or
requires
Airbnb
to
retain
data.
On
24 October
2019, Airbnb
confirmed
to
the
complainant
that their
personal
data had
been
deleted
pursuant
to
Airbnb’s obligations
under
the
GDPR.
2. The
complainant
also
alleged
that
they
submitted
an
access
request
to
Airbnb,
via
email
on
02 September
2019, pursuant
to
Article
15 of
the
GDPR,
to
which
they
received
no
response.
3. The
DPC
notified
Airbnb
of
the
complaint
by
way
of
letter
on 08
June 2020
and
provided Airbnb
with
a
copy
of
the
complaint.
4. Airbnb
reverted
to
the
DPC
confirming
that
the
complainant's account
had
been
deleted.
Airbnb advised
the
DPC
that the
complainant
had
requested
that their
account
be
deleted and
was asked
by
Airbnb
to
verify
their
identity
by
providing
ID,
in
accordance
with
its
identity
verification
procedures,
further details
of
which
it
advised,
are
set
out
in
its
“Help
Centre”
article.
Airbnb
stated
that the
complainant
raised
concerns
with
providing
a
copy
of
their
ID
and
so
its
community
support
agents
verified the
complainant's
identity
using
an
alternative verification
method,
namely
having
the
complainant
log
in
to
their
Airbnb account. Airbnb informed
the
DPC
that,
once
their identity
was
verified,
its
agents
notified the
complainant
that
their
deletion
request was
being
processed
and
also
that
certain data
may
be
retained:
“Airbnb
will
delete your personal
data,
except
to
the
extent
## GDPR

permits
or
requires
us
to
retain that data. For example, we retain data that
is
necessary

complying with laws to which we are subject, for exercising the right of freedom of
expression and information (such as the content overviews \[sic\]), and for the
establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (such as Information relating to
user disputes)”
In addition, Airbnb stated that it informed the complainant that they would not
receive any further emails from Airbnb.
Airbnb advised
the
DPC
that
subsequent
to
this,
the
complainant
emailed
Ajirbnb
on
24 October
2019 requesting
access
to
their
personal
data
retained
post-
deletion,
contrary
to
the
complainant’s
assertion
they
submitted
their
access
request
on
02 September
2019. Airbnb advised
the
DPC
that,
regretfully,
the
complainant's
request
was
not
escalated
to
the
relevant
team.
Similarly,
when
the
complainant
emailed
Airbnb’s
community
support
team
on 08
November
2019, the
agent
did
not
link
the
request
to
any
particular
account
as
the
complainant's
account
had
already
been
deleted.
Airbnb
advised
the
DPC
that
it
was
investigating
the
cause
of
this
oversight
and
would
like
to
offer
its
apologies
to
the
complainant
for
the
inconvenience caused
by
this
error.
Airbnb advised
the
DPC
that
it
was,
at
that
time,
processing
the
complainant's
access
request
post-deletion.
In an attempt to facilitate the amicable resolution of the complaint, the DPC
reverted to the complainant advising them that the DPC had communicated with
Airbnb on this matter. The DPC advised the complainant that Airbnb stated that
their account, and associated personal data (including phone recordings), had
been erased to the extent required by GDPR as they had verified their identity by
way of logging in to their Airbnb account, and that no further personal data wasprovided
for
this
purpose.
The DPC advised the complainant that, regarding their access request, which was
made after the erasure of their account, Airbnb informed the DPC that this request
would be processed and issued to them directly by email and that they should have
now received this correspondence. The DPC informed the complainant that Airbnb
had noted that this request was not initially processed as the account had already
been erased and that Airbnb has apologised for this and provided the below
explanation:
{RE
mailed Airbnb
on 24
October 2019 requesting access
to
her
personal
data
retained post-deletion. Regretfully,
this
request was
not
escalated
to
the
relevant
team. Similarly,
wherlfjemailed
our

support team
on
8 November2019,
the
agent
did not

26.With
regard
to
its
response
to
the
complainant's
erasure
request,
Airbnb
advised
that
a
review
of
the
documentation
provided
with
the
complaint
by
the
DPC
in
June
2020 indicates
that
the
erasure
request
was
received
by
Airbnb
on
17 August
2019. Airbnb
noted
that
the
documentation
provided
with
the
complaint
by
the
DPC
contained
a
copy
of
an
email from
Airbnb
to
the
complainant
dated
17 August
2019, confirming
receipt
of
the
deletion
request
and
setting
out
the
required
authentication
steps
for
the
complainant.
Airbnb
stated
that the
request
was
ultimately
authenticated
by the
complainant
on
2 September
2019 (and
provided
the
below
screenshot
of
the
relevant
extract
from
its
records).
27.With
regard
to
the
DPC’s
request
for
clarification
as
to
the
date
the
complainant's
erasure request
was completed
and
all
data
was
deleted,
Airbnb advised
that the
deletion
of
an
Airbnb
account
is
a
highly
technical
process
that
involves
a
number
of
stages
/
phases.
Airbnb advised
that the
length
of
time
it
takes
to
delete
an
account
in
its
entirety
is
dependent
on
a
number
of
variables, including
the
volume
and nature
of
the
data
on
the
account
as well as
confirmations
from various
internal
teams
that
certain
additional data
is
not
required
to
be
held
for
legal
or
regulatory
reasons. Airbnb
stated
that
it
informed
the
complainant
of
this fact:
“Please
note
that the
deletion
process
itself
happens
over
a
period
of
time
acrossour
systems.
We
are not
able
to
confirm
the
exact
date
on
which
the
deletion
process
for
any
given
request
completes”28.Airbnb
stated
that,
in
the
context
of
the
complaint, Airbnb
could
not
confirm from
its
records
when
the
deletion
process was completed.
Airbnb
stated
that
separate
deletion
processes
are
in
place
for
phone
call
recordings, which
are
automatically
deleted
on
a
cyclical basis,
unless Airbnb
is
required
to
retain
these recordings
for
specific
reasons. Airbnb advised
that,
as
confirmed
by
Airbnb
in its
response
to
the
DPC
dated
22 June 2020
in
respect
of
the
underlying complaint,
all
phone
recordings
in
respect
of
the
complainant
had
been deleted
by that point
in
time.

stated
that
it
provided
the
complainant
with the
post-deletion
access
file
on
17 July
2020. However,
as the
account
had
been
deleted,
Airbnb’s investigations
into
the
issues
that
resulted
in
the
mishandling
of
the
post-deletion
access
request
have
not
yielded
further
insight
into
what
transpired.
The
DPC
received
a
response
from
the
complainant
via
the Berlin
DPA
on 19
July
2021. In
their
response,

complainant confirmed
that
they
were agreeable
to
all
information
that
they had
previously provided
in
the
context
of
the

handling
process
being
used
for
the
purposes
of

correspondence
the
complainant
informed
that
DPC
that
they
did
not
provide
a
copy
of
their
ID
to
Airbnb
for
identification
purposes. The
complainant
also
provided
a
number
of
correspondence
they had
exchanged
with
Airbnb.
The
DPC
reverted
to
Airbnb
via
email
on 24
January
2022. The

advised
Airbnb
that,
in

to
the
