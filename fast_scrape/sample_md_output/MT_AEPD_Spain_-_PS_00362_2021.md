## English Summary

### Facts

The Banco Bilbao provided clients with ‘Affinity Cards’, which are a credit cards that could be used only within an affiliated group of several stores and companies. In this regard, any person calling the automated information hotline provided by the bank was able to obtain details of the last transactions of a card in exchange of the card-holder's ID-number.

In the abstinence of other security measures to confirm the identity of the client, any person could call into the automated systems to obtain financial information only by giving the ID-number without verifying that they are the real owner of the document.

### Holding

The AEPD decided that the bank thereby failed to adopt security measures, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality according to [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and the necessity to implement technical and organizational safeguards from [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). Accordingly, only asking for the ID-number is insufficient to appropriately authenticate the client in question.

Considering the number of clients affected, the solvency and the high degree of responsibility of the entity, the DPA imposed a fine of €200.000 on the bank. However, the fine was finally reduced to €120.000 because of prior voluntary payment and their acknowledgment of responsibility.

                                              II

## Article 58 of the RGPD states:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/16

"2. Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers

listed below:

(…)

i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of
the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each

(…)

 f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate data security

personal data, including protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures
or appropriate organizational ('integrity and confidentiality') ”.

In turn, the security of personal data is regulated in article 32, of the
RGPD, where it is established that:

 "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the

nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/16

appropriate organizational arrangements to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,
that in your case include, among others:

a) pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;

a) the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and
permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;

b) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data

consequence of accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of data
personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.

of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/16

"4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 or,

the highest amount:

a) the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge in accordance with articles 8, 11, 25 a
39, 42 and 43.

(…) "

For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infractions, states that: “They constitute

offenses the acts and conducts referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the
## Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the

present organic law ”.

And in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, it qualifies as “Infractions considered

serious ”:

"Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the

following:

(…)

f) Failure to adopt technical and organizational measures that result
appropriate to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the treatment,

in the terms required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                             III

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/16

The RGPD in the aforementioned article 32, does not establish a list of security measures
that are applicable in accordance with the data that are subject to treatment, but

that establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply measures
technical and organizational that are appropriate to the risk involved in the treatment,
taking into account the state of the art, the costs of application, the nature,

scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of probability and severity
for the rights and freedoms of the interested persons.

Likewise, the security measures must be adequate and proportionate to the
risk detected, noting that the determination of the technical measures and
organizational must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymisation and encryption,

ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience, the
ability to restore availability and access to data after an incident, process

verification (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of
measures.

In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the security level, the

particularly take into account the risks presented by data processing, such as
consequence of accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of data

personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data and that could cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

In this same sense, recital 83 of the RGPD states that:

“(83) In order to maintain security and prevent the treatment from violating the provisions of

this Regulation, the person in charge or the person in charge must assess the risks
inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as encryption. Are

Measures should ensure an adequate level of security, including the
confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application
with respect to the risks and the nature of the personal data that must

protect yourself. When assessing risk in relation to data security, you should
take into account the risks arising from the processing of personal data,
such as accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of personal data

transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or communication or access does not
authorized to said data, susceptible in particular to cause damages
physical, material or immaterial ”.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/16

                                            IV

In this case, it is stated that the claimed entity facilitates the detail of the
last movements of the Affinity Card through an attention system
automated telephone number \*\*\* TELEPHONE. 1 which only asks for

as identification data the client's DNI.

Unless proven otherwise, these facts suppose that the respondent would not adopt the

adequate security measures, since anyone using the system
Automated telephone service could give a DNI number, whether or not the owner of the

itself and obtain information associated with that DNI, since the claimed entity does not
adopts security measures to verify that the person requesting said
information is the owner of said identification document.

This Agency informed the entity of the claim presented and
requested information in relation to this claim, in accordance with the

Article 65.4 of the RGPD.

On September 25, 2020, the entity claimed in response to said request

requests the suspension of the procedure, in accordance with article 76.2 of the law
39/2015 of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations,

alleging defects in the processing.

The Spanish Agency for Data Protection addressed the claimed requesting him

information in accordance with article 65.4 of the RGPD that establishes the following:

"Before deciding on the admission for processing of the claim, the Spanish Agency

of Data Protection may send the same to the data protection delegate who
had, where appropriate, designated the person in charge or in charge of the treatment or the
supervisory body established for the application of codes of conduct to

the effects provided for in articles 37 and 38.2 of this organic law. The agency
Spanish Data Protection may also send the claim to the
responsible or in charge of the treatment when a

data protection officer or adhering to resolution mechanisms
extrajudicial of conflicts, in which case the person in charge or manager must give

response to the claim within a month. "
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/16

Said requirement is ex gratia character, to discern on the convenience or

not to admit the procedure for processing by virtue of the answer given by the
claimed from this Agency, to avoid initiating procedures as far as possible

penalties when the situation that is the subject of the claim has already been resolved or
there is a serious and verifiable purpose that is being solved, without prejudice to
the investigation actions that the Spanish Agency for Data Protection,

as a supervisory authority, it can always carry out, if it considers it appropriate and
necessary, in accordance with article 57.1 of the RGPD.

Neither of the two is inferred from the answer given by the claimed entity.
indicated possibilities.

Therefore, due to the facts claimed, that is, lack of adoption of measures of
adequate security by the claimed entity, without respecting the principle of

integrity and confidentiality of article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, whose purpose, among others, is to avoid
unauthorized or illegal treatment of personal data, this Agency proceeds to
the opening of the corresponding sanctioning procedure against the entity

claimed, for the possible violation of article 32 of the RGPD, transcribed in the
Ground II that states that “the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply
appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security

suitable".

In addition, in accordance with article 32 of the RGPD, it will be required that the claimed

take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of
adequate security using mechanisms that allow:

-the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;

-the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience
permanent treatment systems and services;

-the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data of
quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/16

-a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the
technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

                                            V

Article 83.4 a) of the RGPD establishes that:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the

of greater amount:

a) the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge in accordance with articles 8, 11, 25 a
39, 42 and 43

In turn, article 73.f) of the LOPDGDD, under the heading "Violations considered

bass has:

"Based on article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, they will be considered serious and

The infractions that suppose a substantial violation will prescribe after two years
of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following:

f) Failure to adopt technical and organizational measures that result
appropriate to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the treatment,

in the terms required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                            SAW

In accordance with the indicated precepts, against the infringement of article 32,
considers that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted in accordance with the following

criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/16

As aggravating factors the following:

     The number of clients of the claimed entity is high and therefore also the

        number of affected (art. 83.2 a)

     The respondent is a solvent entity that has the technical means to take
        adequate security measures, their lack implies negligence in their actions

        (art. 83.2 b)

     The high degree of responsibility of the claimed party, since trying to
        daily personal data of your customers as part of your business and

        adopting adequate security measures, including those of the
        regulation for the prevention of fraud in banking entities, is
