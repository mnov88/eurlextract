## English Summary

### Facts

A third party unlawfully accessed the medical files of the data subject. The controller had registries of who accessed medical files, proving that the unlawful access really happened, configuring a data breach. Medical files are part of the special categories of data and the processing of sensitive data has higher risks. The data controller had some means of protection and access control of the data, but not enough.

### Holding

The DPA held that a data breach occurred and that the controller should be considered liable since there were no sufficient measures to avoid unlawful access to the data (Article 5(1)(f) and [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR")). Even though some measures were in place, they were not adequate for the protection required for sensitive data (Article 9 GDPR).

## Comment

The controller mentioned various measures to be considered as means of avoiding a data breach, but the DPA found them not effective. For example, the access registry has the purpose of posterior control but does not help prevent data breaches. The DPA also highlighted the need of an proactive approach from the controller.

of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (in

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/26

hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD and article
32 of the RGPD, typified in articles 83.5 and 83.4 of the RGPD, respectively.

The initiation agreement was sent, in accordance with the rules established in the Law
39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), through electronic notification,
being received on January 5, 2022, as stated in the certificate included
on the record.

SIXTH: Once the initiation agreement was notified, the claimed party presented a written

allegations in which, in summary, he stated:

-that the Hospital Responsible for Data Processing, Hospital Universitario La
Paz (HULP), carried out an investigation of the events, concluding after it that
There were improper accesses to your medical history during the interval in which the
complainant was in the emergency room (3:46 a.m. until 10:12 a.m. of the same

day on which you are discharged: June 13, 2020),

-that there are adequate and sufficient security measures for the management of
Clinical Records, whenever user activities are recorded, retaining
the information necessary to monitor, analyze, investigate and document

improper or unauthorized activities, allowing the identification of the
person who acts, the center having a protocol established for such purposes, in
which includes a process of reactive and proactive audits, the latter being
on a monthly basis and following a specific structure and monitoring, to address
the requirements of the Ministry of Health in case of improper access to

medical records,

-that they have a security policy at the level of the Ministry of Health, which
provides for specific organizational measures to maintain confidentiality
of the information accessed by the organization's workers,

-that in the medical records management system there is a segregation of profiles
for the use of the tool, based on the work performance of each of the
positions.

The document that establishes the assignment of Users and type profiles is attached, in the

which state that: “it can be verified that due compliance is given to the principle
of minimum privilege, in accordance with the provisions of Annex II \[op.acc.3\] of the
National Security Scheme strictly limiting each user to the minimum
necessary to fulfill its obligations. Likewise, privileges are limited
that users only access information necessary for the fulfillment of their

functions.

Therefore, there are different defined user models, such as:

• Administrative User
• Medical User (one per specialty)

• Nurse User (midwives, supervisors, nurses)
• Consultation User (only gives access to view the information, but does not allow registration)
• User for other non-medical groups

patient, that is, the medical history must be accessible in such a way that it can be
ensure that adequate care is provided to each patient, taking into account

the diversity of health professionals existing in the center. For example, in the
emergency cases, this medical history must be accessible to ensure the
vital interests of each citizen.

When a professional joins the center, they are assigned the model user

established, but if the professional changes his functions or requires new functions,
must have the approval of the Management. In the event that a user claims
new functions and there is no established model user, Management values the
relevance of creating a new model user.

Thus, and as we can see in the protocol, there are no generic users,

but rather, they are users created according to the functions they have
assigned, with univocal and nominal access for each professional with their access number.
“Personal ID.”

-that have the signature of a Confidentiality Commitment, through which

informs the worker at the time of formalizing his contract with the hospital, about the
security and privacy policies that are mandatory for employees of the
Hospital,

-that training is provided regarding the security of personal data

staff,

powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Regulation of

Data Protection, hereinafter RGPD), grants each control authority and according to
the provisions of articles 47 and 48.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5,

On August 23, 2022, the claimed party is notified of the consideration of
that, from the proven facts, not only the violation of article 5.1.f) of the
RGPD, but also that of article 32 of the same legal text.

TENTH: Once the Proposed Resolution was notified, the claimed party presented a written
of allegations in which, in summary, he stated that an adequate provision of the
healthcare involves the participation of several services from the same center for the

achievement of the ultimate goal of the patient's well-being and health, which, in fact, in the
health practice, it is common that an emergency service can lead to a
operating room service, in which it would be strictly necessary to preserve the
vital interests of the affected person, that the health personnel of both services have
immediate access to the patient's medical history in order to provide adequate

emergency healthcare.

In response to the allegations presented by the entity claimed in the Agreement of

initiation of the sanctioning procedure, the following must be noted:

The GDPR broadly defines “data security breaches.”
“personal violations” (hereinafter security bankruptcy) as “all those violations of the
security that causes the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of
personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the

unauthorized communication or access to said data.”

In the present case, it is clear that a data security breach occurred
personal in the circumstances indicated above, categorized as a gap of
confidentiality, as a consequence of exposure to a third party, of the

personal data relating to the health of the complaining party.

## Article 32 of the GDPR states the following:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of

variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms
physical, the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which, if applicable, includes, among others:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data
b) the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience

c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data of

d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the

unauthorized access to said data.

3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved pursuant to article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the

present article.

4. The controller and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to ensure that
any person acting under the authority of the person responsible or in charge and
has access to personal data can only process said data following
instructions of the person responsible, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Law of

the Union or the Member States.”

The aforementioned article contemplates that “the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment
Appropriate technical and organizational measures will be applied to ensure a level of
security appropriate to the risk.” Consequently, it does not adopt a closed relationship of

technical and organizational measures, but these must be appropriate in
depending on the previously analyzed risk level.

That said, article 32.1 includes an obligation of means and not an obligation
of result. In effect, it indicates that “the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment applies
appropriate technical and organizational measures will be taken to ensure a level of security.

“adequate to the risk,” That is, it imposes the obligation to establish a level of security

must carry out in accordance with section 2 of said article:

      sequence of accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
      transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication
      “unauthorized use or access to said data.”

The technological evolution and sophistication of unauthorized access systems to systems
data issues means that regulations cannot unconditionally impose
a total assurance of the absence of integrity or confidentiality breaches.
But it does require that those responsible for the treatments must carry out an analysis of
risks and the implementation of an “adequate security level” for them.

This duty is therefore characterized as an obligation of means. This is what he has declared
The Supreme Court stated in its recent ruling of February 15, 2022:

      “The obligation to adopt the necessary measures to guarantee the safety
      of personal data cannot be considered an obligation of result, which

      implies that a leak of personal data to a third party exists
      responsibility regardless of the measures adopted and the activity
      displayed by the person responsible for the file or processing.

      In the obligations of means the commitment that is acquired is to adopt

      the technical and organizational means, as well as deploying diligent activity
      in its implementation and use that tends to achieve the expected result with
      means that can reasonably be described as suitable and sufficient for its

      treatment".

      The difference lies in the responsibility in both cases, since while
      In the obligation of result, one responds to a harmful result due to the failure of the
      security system, whatever its cause and the diligence used. In the
      obligation of means, it is enough to establish technically adequate measures and
      implement and use them with reasonable diligence.

      In the latter, the sufficiency of the security measures that the person responsible
      must be established must be put in relation to the state of technology in

      are treated, but a result is not guaranteed. As established in art. 17.1
      of Directive 95/46/EC regarding the security of the treatment, the person responsible

      of the treatment has the obligation to apply the technical and organizational measures
      "Such measures must guarantee, taking into account the known
      existing technical foundations and the cost of application, a level of security
      appropriate in relation to the risks presented by the treatment and the nature

      nowdays the art. 31 of the European Union Regulation 2016/679, of the

      Parliament and of the Council regarding the protection of natural persons in respect
      regarding the processing of personal data and the free circulation of these
      data and by which Directive 95/46/EC is repealed, by establishing with respect to the

      They sound physical \[…\]».

      We have already reasoned that the obligation that falls on the person responsible for the file

      and on the person in charge of the treatment regarding the adoption of necessary measures.
      rias to guarantee the security of personal data is not a

      connection with the nature of the processing carried out and the personal data in

      issue, reasonably allow to avoid its alteration, loss, treatment or
      Unauthorized access."

Having established the above, that is, that the obligation of means imposed by article 32 of the
RGPD consists of adopting security measures in the treatment, aimed at

avoid the production of a security breach in it. These obligations of-

Consequently, the analysis must be performed to determine whether the incident has occurred.
Compliance consists of determining whether the measures were sufficient to avoid

In relation to these allegations, the following must be meant:

Of the five security measures described, it can be ruled out from the beginning that
four of them can be effective in preventing unauthorized access. In
First of all, logging access or carrying out audits are measures to
react a posteriori, once the access had occurred. Secondly, the bank
ner has only informative purposes, without preventing the professional from continuing in
in case access was not justified. Finally, the commitment to trust

Deniality does not, in itself, prevent unauthorized access.

Only the segmentation of access profiles to medical records could con-
be considered a valid and effective tool for avoiding events such as the presence of
I marry you. The DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH provides a very detailed annex with the profiles

of each of the types of professional category, distinguishing between
administrative and health, and within this last category, by types and specialties of
staff.

Now, a measure that would be basic is not reflected in the document, and that is that
each of the health professionals could have access to the medical records

only of those patients on whom they carry out their care activity.

In this sense, article 16 of Law 41/2002, of November 14, basic regulation

patient have access to their clinical history as a fundamental instrument to
their adequate assistance.
2. Each center will establish the methods that enable access to

the clinical history of each patient by the professionals who assist them” (the emphasis
is ours).

From reading this precept it is clearly inferred that, although the clinical history is
the instrument to provide health care to the patient, which must be
guaranteed, so is the fact that access can only occur

to the clinical history by the professionals who assist you, not in general terms, but
on a particular basis carrying out the diagnosis or treatment of the patient.

Let us remember that the factual situation that gave rise to this procedure consists of
consists of access by a nursing person from the Operating Room Service

regarding a patient who received medical assistance in the Emergency Department.

It is true that, as the interested party states, “the clinical history is an instrument intended
fundamentally to guarantee adequate care to the patient, that is, the
medical history must be accessible in such a way that it can be ensured that it is provided

adequate assistance to each patient”, but it is no less important that they can implement
measures, based on the patients assigned to each professional, of the service in

The lack of adoption of a measure such as the one described means that it cannot be considered
that there are security measures that provide an adequate level of protection
to existing risks. In fact, the HEALTH DEPARTMENT itself recognizes the

illegality of the conduct, since a disciplinary file was processed against
the person who carried out the improper access, and which concluded with the imposition of a
warning.

In relation to the precedent invoked (exp. AP/00056/2014), it is necessary to point out that

Organic 15/1999, of December 13, on Protection of Personal Data.
(LOPD)

The system established by the previous LOPD differs substantially from that established by
the current GDPR. While that established a system of security measures

ity established normatively (in conjunction with the RLOPD) to be understood
Once security obligations have been met, the current GDPR is based on the
principles of proactive responsibility and data protection by design, that is,
in establishing the measures that are necessary based on the risks
values inherent to a given treatment. There is, therefore, no number

rus clausus of measures that the data controller must adopt, but rather
These must be established case by case, based on the risk analysis and the
data that is being processed.

In this regard, article 5.2 GDPR establishes, after listing the principles
related to the protection of personal data, the following:

      "2. The person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the provisions
      put in section 1 and able to demonstrate it (“proactive responsibility”).”

And regarding the principle of data protection by design, the GDPR requires:

      "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of the application and the na-

after the entry into force of the GDPR. This is file reference PS/00250/2021,

the proposed resolution and another for that of article 32 of the Regulation. That is the criterion
of this Agency in relation to this type of assumptions.

                                           III
In response to the latest allegations presented by the claimed entity, it must be
point out the following:

First of all, we are faced with a special category of personal data
(article 9.1 GDPR) to which the principle of prohibition of processing is applicable,
unless any of the circumstances provided for in section 2 occur. Therefore,
incorporate an innate danger, and must be held to a higher standard of protection
high.

Recital 51 provides, regarding the special categories of personal data,

that:

 “Personal data deserve special protection, which, by their nature, are
particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms,
since the context of their treatment could entail significant risks for the
fundamental rights and freedoms. \[…\] Such personal data should not be

treated, unless treatment is permitted in specific situations
contemplated in this Regulation, taking into account that the States
Members may establish specific provisions on data protection with
in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation to the
compliance with a legal obligation or the fulfillment of a mission carried out in
public interest or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the person responsible for the

treatment. In addition to the specific requirements of that treatment,
the general principles and other rules of this Regulation, in particular as regards
refers to the conditions of legality of the treatment. They must be established

explicit exceptions to the general prohibition of processing of these categories
special personal data, among other things when the interested party gives his or her
explicit consent or in the case of specific needs, in particular

when the treatment is carried out within the framework of legitimate activities by
certain associations or foundations whose objective is to allow the exercise of the
fundamental liberties".

It is a priority to determine the role played by the Ministry of Health.

It follows that the person responsible for processing the data that forms part of the
clinical history is the health center, public or private; They have the obligation to
prepare it, guard it and implement the necessary security measures so that it does not

Not allowed.
The GDPR explicitly introduces the principle of liability (article 5.2 GDPR),
That is, the person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the

provided in section 1 of article 5 and must be able to demonstrate it
“proactive responsibility”.

Report 0064/2020 of the Legal Office of the AEPD has clearly expressed
that “The GDPR has represented a paradigm shift in addressing the regulation of
right to the protection of personal data, which is based on the

principle of “accountability” or “proactive responsibility” as pointed out
repeatedly by the AEPD (Report 17/2019, among many others) and is included in the
Explanation of reasons for Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of
Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (LOPDGDD)”.

The complained party, in its capacity as responsible for said treatment, should
have adopted and implemented, proactively, the technical measures and
organizational measures that are appropriate to evaluate and guarantee a level of
security adequate to probable risks of diverse nature and severity

linked to the health data processing carried out.

For these purposes, article 24 of the RGPD under the heading “Responsibility of the
responsible for the treatment” provides:

       "1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment
       as well as the risks of varying probability and severity for the rights
       rights and freedoms of natural persons, the person responsible for the treatment applied

       will take appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee and be able to

       Measures will be reviewed and updated when necessary.
       2. When provided in relation to treatment activities,
       The measures mentioned in paragraph 1 shall include the application, for
       part of the person responsible for the treatment, of the appropriate protection policies

       of data. (…)”

For its part, article 25 of the RGPD under the heading “Data protection from the
master and by default” provides:

       "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of the application and the na-
       nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as the risks of

       at the time of determining the means of treatment as well as at the time

       of the treatment itself, appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as

       data protection, such as data minimization, and integrate safeguards

Likewise, the LOPDGDD in article 28.1 states that:

the security measures that are necessary to prevent the filtration or dissemination of
this type of data to third parties. In this sense, the configuration of the technical measures

Consequently, the allegations must be rejected, meaning that the

arguments presented do not distort the essential content of the infringement that
is declared committed nor do they constitute sufficient justification or exculpation.

The claimed entity is charged with committing an infraction due to violation of the
article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, which governs the principle of confidentiality and integrity of the

personal data, as well as the proactive responsibility of the person responsible for the
processing to demonstrate compliance and article 32 of the GDPR.

The processing of data from medical records is regulated in the Law

In article 16, the uses of medical history are established:

"1. The clinical history is an instrument designed fundamentally to guarantee

adequate patient care. The care professionals at the center who
perform the diagnosis or treatment of the patient have access to the medical history
of this as a fundamental instrument for their adequate assistance.

2. Each center will establish the methods that enable access to

In relation to this principle, Recital 39 of the aforementioned GDPR states that:

“\[…\]Personal data must be treated in a way that guarantees security and

appropriate confidentiality of personal data, including to prevent access
or unauthorized use of said data and the equipment used in the treatment.”

It must be added that, in relation to the category of data to which a third party
someone else has had access to, they are in the special category according to

provided in art. 9 of the RGPD, a circumstance that represents an added risk that
must be assessed in the risk management study and that the degree requirement increases
of protection in relation to the security and safeguarding of the integrity and
confidentiality of these data.

Consequently, it is considered that the proven facts are constitutive of
infringement, attributable to the claimed party, due to violation of article 5.1.f) of the

## Article 32 of the GDPR

## Article 32 of the GDPR, security of processing, establishes the following:

         1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms
physical, the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and

appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which, if applicable, includes, among others:

          a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

          b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
          c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
personnel quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

          d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

         2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to
take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data

personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data (The emphasis is from the AEPD).
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 22/26

Recital 75 of the GDPR lists a series of factors or assumptions associated with
risks to the guarantees of the rights and freedoms of the interested parties:

“The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of seriousness and
variable probability, may be due to data processing that could cause
physical, material or immaterial damages, particularly in cases where
that the treatment may give rise to problems of discrimination, usurpation of
identity or fraud, financial loss, reputational damage, loss of

confidentiality of data subject to professional secrecy, unauthorized reversal of the
pseudonymization or any other significant economic or social harm; in the
cases in which the interested parties are deprived of their rights and freedoms or are
prevents you from exercising control over your personal data; in cases where the data
processed personal reveals ethnic or racial origin, political opinions, religion

or philosophical beliefs, militancy in unions and the processing of genetic data,
data relating to health or data on sexual life, or convictions and offenses
criminal or related security measures; in cases in which they are evaluated
personal aspects, in particular the analysis or prediction of aspects related to the
performance at work, economic situation, health, preferences or interests
personal, reliability or behavior, situation or movements, in order to create or

use personal profiles; in cases in which personal data of
vulnerable people, particularly children; or in cases where the treatment
involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of
interested.”

In the present case, as stated in the facts and in the context of the file
E/05028/2021, the AEPD requested to provide the date and time of the accesses, the details of the
typology of the data accessed, as well as the documentation accrediting the
existing justification for such access. In the documentation provided, the
claimed only recognizes the existence of said accesses although it does not pronounce itself

about their legitimacy nor does it provide a copy of the required investigation.

The consequence of this implementation of deficient security measures was the
exposure to a third party outside of personal data related to the health of the
complaining party. That is, the affected person has been deprived of control over her
personal data related to your clinical history.

It must be added that, in relation to the category of data to which a third party
someone else has had access to, they are in the special category according to
provided in art. 9 of the RGPD, a circumstance that represents an added risk that
must be assessed in the risk management study and that the degree requirement increases

of protection in relation to the security and safeguarding of the integrity and
confidentiality of these data.

This risk must be taken into account by the person responsible for the treatment who must
establish the necessary technical and organizational measures to prevent the loss of

control of the data by the person responsible for the treatment and, therefore, by the
holders of the data who provided them.

Therefore, the proven facts constitute an infringement, attributable to the
claimed party, for violation of article 32 RGPD.

                  Classification of the violation of article 32 of the RGPD

The aforementioned violation of article 32 of the RGPD implies the commission of the violations
typified in article 83.4 of the RGPD that under the heading “General conditions

for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

“Infringements of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 or,

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 “Infringements” establishes that
“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law.”

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 73 “Infringements considered serious”
of the LOPDGDD indicates:

“Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that involve a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the

element of guilt.

Article 83 “General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines” of the

“Without prejudice to the corrective powers of the supervisory authorities under the
Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down rules on whether

Likewise, article 77 “Regime applicable to certain categories of
responsible or in charge of processing” of the LOPDGDD provides the following:

"1. The regime established in this article will apply to the treatments of

who are responsible or in charge:

(…)

c) The General Administration of the State, the Administrations of the communities

The resolution will be notified to the person responsible or in charge of the treatment, to the body of the

3. Without prejudice to what is established in the previous section, the authority for the protection of
data will also propose the initiation of disciplinary actions when there are
sufficient evidence for this. In this case, the procedure and sanctions to apply

will be those established in the legislation on disciplinary or sanctioning regime that
results of application.

5. They will be communicated to the Ombudsman or, where appropriate, to similar institutions

In the present case, it is considered appropriate to sanction the party with a warning

claimed, for violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD and for violation of article 32
of the GDPR, due to the lack of diligence in implementing the appropriate measures
of security with the consequence of the breach of the principle of confidentiality.

                                       Measures

Article 58.2 of the GDPR provides: “Each supervisory authority will have all the
following corrective powers indicated below:

        d) order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable,
in a certain manner and within a specified period;”

Likewise, it is appropriate to impose the corrective measure described in article 58.2.d) of the
RGPD and order the complained party to, within a period of one month, establish the measures
adequate safety measures so that treatments are adapted to the demands

contemplated in articles 5.1 f) and 32 of the RGPD, preventing the occurrence of
similar situations in the future.

The text of the resolution establishes what infractions have been committed and
the events that have given rise to the violation of the regulations for the protection of
data, from which it is clearly inferred what measures to adopt, without prejudice

that the type of procedures, mechanisms or specific instruments to
implementing them corresponds to the sanctioned party, since it is responsible for the
treatment who fully knows its organization and must decide, based on the
proactive responsibility and risk approach, how to comply with the GDPR and
LOPDGDD.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and evaluated the criteria of
graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: SANCTION with WARNING the HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF
THE COMMUNITY OF MADRID, with NIF S7800001E, for a violation of the article
