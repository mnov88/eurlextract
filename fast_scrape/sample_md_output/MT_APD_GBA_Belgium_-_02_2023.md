## English Summary

### Facts

On 1 December 2022, the data subject requested the controller to erase his personal data under [Article 17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR"). In order to do so, he followed the instructions provided in the controller's privacy policy. However, the controller did not acknowledge receipt, not even after the data subject sent a reminder on 19 December 2022. On the 28 December 2022, almost a month after the data subject had submitted his erasure request, the controller sent him a promotional e-mail. The data subject filed a complaint at the Belgian DPA on 3 January 2023 for the lack of a response by the controller.

### Holding

The DPA first confirmed that the data subject correctly exercised his right to erasure. The DPA held that the controller breached [Articles 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR"), [12(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR") and [17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR") because it did not respond in time to the erasure request and even sent a promotional e-mail after the request had been submitted. The DPA ordered the controller to comply with the erasure request and ordered the controller to provide the DPA with an update within 30 days on which action it had taken.

## Comment

This was a preliminary (Prima Facie) decision according to Article 95 WOG, prior to a decision on the merits.

                                                         Decision 02/2023 of 18 January 2023

File number : DOS-2023-00059

Subject : Exercising the right to erasure without the defendant doing so

follows

The Disputes Chamber of the Data Protection Authority, composed of Mr Hielke Hijmans,
sole chairman;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of 27 April 2016 on

the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and

on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (general
Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter GDPR;

Having regard to the law of 3 December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority, hereinafter WOG;

Having regard to the rules of internal order, as approved by the Chamber of Representatives

on December 20, 2018 and published in the Belgian Official Gazette on January 15, 2019;

Having regard to the documents in the file;

has taken the following decision regarding:

. The complainant: Mr X, hereinafter referred to as “the complainant”; .
. The defendant: Y, hereinafter “the defendant”. Decision 02/2023 - 2/5

I. Factual Procedure

    1. On January 3, 2023, the complainant filed a complaint with the Data Protection Authority against the

        defendant.

    2. On 1 December 2022, the complainant addressed the defendant with a request for the

        delete the relevant personal data pursuant to Article 17.1 GDPR, in accordance with the

        privacy policy of the defendant. The complainant has sent a reminder to the defendant
        December 19, 2022. As of January 3, 2023, the complainant has not yet received a response from the defendant

        in connection with the data erasure request. Received on December 28, 2022

        however, the complainant still receives an email with promotions from the defendant. Following this, the

        complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority.

    3. On January 9, 2023, the complaint will be declared admissible by the First Line Service on the basis of the

        Articles 58 and 60 WOG and the complaint pursuant to Article 62, §1 WOG is transferred to the

        Litigation room.

II. Motivation

    4. The Disputes Chamber determines on the basis of the documents that substantiate the complaint that the complainant is entitled

        to data erasure in accordance with Article 17.1 GDPR has exercised on December 1, 2022, and a
        sent a reminder on December 19, 2022. From the documents accompanying the complaint, the

        Litigation Chamber that the complainant has carried out his request for data erasure by sending

        of an e-mail to the designated e-mail address of the defendant. Pursuant to Article 12.3 GDPR

        the controller, in this case the defendant, must respond to the request

        to respond to data erasure within one month of receipt of the request. Possibly possible

        this period may be extended by a further two months, given the complexity of the
        request. The complainant must then inform about this within one month of the request for data erasure

        extension will be notified. If the defendant decides not to comply with the

        request of the complainant, it must communicate this within one month of receipt of the request

        to the data subject, in accordance with Article 12.4 GDPR. It does not appear from the file that the complainant has any

        received an answer about the consequence of the data erasure by the defendant
        is given. In addition, it appears from the documents that were added to the complaint that the complainant

        received another email with promotions from the defendant on 28th December 2022. because of this

        the controller has acted in violation of Articles 12.3 and 12.4 GDPR, as well

        Article 17.1 GDPR.

    5. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that on the basis of the above analysis it should be

        concluded that a breach of the provisions of the GDPR has been committed by the defendant,

        which justifies that in this case a decision is taken on the basis of Decision 02/2023 - 3/5

        Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 WOG. The Disputes Chamber has thus decided on the basis

        of Articles 58.2. c) and 95, §1, 5° of the Law of 3 December 2017, to order the defendant

        that the data subject's requests to exercise his rights are met, more

        determines the right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) as stipulated in Article 17 GDPR.

        has committed an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR and to enable it

        still to comply with the aforementioned provisions.

    8. However, if the defendant does not agree with the contents of this prima facie

        decision and is of the opinion that it can assert factual and/or legal arguments that lead to
