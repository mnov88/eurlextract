## English Summary

### Facts

Unicredit Consumer Financing, the controller, notified the DPA about a data breach in line with its obligations under [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"). This data breach included the name, surname, position, signature of their former employees, the data subjects.

The controller reported that the data was included in certain contractual documents and used in relationships with clients and collaborators, even after employment contracts had been terminated.

The Romanian DPA started an investigation on the matter.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller processed the data subject´s data due to an operational error which led to the use of versions of documents with outdated signatories. Thus, the controller violated the principles laid out in [Article 5(1)(a), (f) and (2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 32(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

The controller also failed to provide a legal basis for the processing of such data and thus violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

Therefore, the DPA deemed it appropriate to impose a fine of RON 24,885 (€5,000).

The DPA also ordered the controller to implement a plan to monitor the application of the relevant procedures to ensure GDPR compliance, especially in relation to the processing of personal data of employees that terminate the contractual employment relationship with the controller.

## English Machine Translation of the Decision

The decision below is a machine translation of the Romanian original. Please refer to the Romanian original for more details.

17.12.2024 Sanction for violation of the GDPR

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in November 2024, an investigation at the operator UNICREDIT CONSUMER FINANCING IFN S.A. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 6 paragraph (1) in conjunction with the provisions of art. 5 paragraph (1) letters a) and f), paragraph (2) and art. 32 paragraph (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

For the act committed, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 24,885 lei, the equivalent of 5,000 euros.

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator UNICREDIT CONSUMER FINANCING IFN S.A. of a personal data breach notification, pursuant to its obligation under the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

It was reported that personal data such as: name, surname, position, signature belonging to data subjects (former employees), were processed by including them in certain contractual documents and used in the relationship with the operator's clients and collaborators, although their individual employment contracts had been terminated.

During the investigation, it was found that UNICREDIT CONSUMER FINANCING IFN S.A. processed the personal data of former employees in violation of the principles provided for by the Regulation, as a result of operational errors.

At the same time, it was found that the operator did not responsibly monitor the application of procedures ensuring the confidentiality and security of personal data, which led to the use of versions of documents with outdated signatories.

In this context, the processing of personal data was carried out without legal basis, in violation of the principles of processing relating to lawfulness, security and protection against unauthorized or illegal processing.

For this act, the operator was fined for violating the provisions of art. 6 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in conjunction with the provisions of art. 5 paragraph (1) letters a) and f), paragraph (2) and art. 32 paragraph (4).

At the same time, the corrective measure of implementing a plan to monitor the application of procedures was ordered against the operator in order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Regulation at all times, including with regard to the processing of personal data of employees who terminate their contractual employment relationship with UNICREDIT CONSUMER FINANCING IFN S.A.

The operator paid the established contravention fine.
