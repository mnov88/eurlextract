## English Summary

### Facts

A private individual (data subject) filed a complaint to the Spanish DPA regarding another private individual (controller) operating camera surveillance aimed towards the public and private space of third parties. The controller did operate multiple cameras from his home, and had in a previous procedure been warned for not adequately informing that the area is video-monitored. Since the last procedure, the controller had installed a new camera, excessively catching public space. The controller, on the other hand, argued that the cameras, with the exception of a minimal and insignificant strip of the public highway, did not capture any public/private space of third parties.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA held that the controllers newly installed cameras excessively captured public and private space of third parties and moreover that there was no justification for this, which constitutes a breach of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the nature of the breach is not deemed as grave. However, the court noted that the controller should have been aware of the requirements of operating camera surveillance due to a previous procedure with the DPA (as previously mentioned in the facts), which the court took into account and hence concluded that the controller acted negligently. Subsequently, the court imposed the controller with a 1000€ in accordance with Article 83(5) GDPR. Finally, the court prompted that it is the responsibility of the controller to ensure compliance with existing legislation.

## Comment

As mentioned, the controller had already been warned by the DPA in a previous procedure concerning the need to inform of the presence of cameras. Taking this into consideration, the controller should already be well aware of the rules and yet not long after infringed the regulation, which must be considered as acting in negligence. In addition, the imposing fine incentivizes the controller to cautiously follow the rules in the future, and fortifies the responsibility of controllers to comply with the regulation and makes it evident that the DPA will reprimand negligent behavior.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to

initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/7

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions

regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

                                           II

In the present case, we proceed to analyze the claim dated 01/27/22 by

means of which is transferred "placement of cameras without proper signage to
public space” (folio nº 1).

       “has placed new devices (cameras) that focus on public roads and the
interior of the houses of other neighbors, controlling at all times the

entrances/exits of apartment number 26 as shown in the
documents attached to this claim” (folio No. 1).

The art. 5.1 c) RGPD provides the following: The personal data will be:

       “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed ("data minimization").

It should be remembered that individuals are responsible for ensuring that the systems
installed comply with current legislation, proving that it complies with
all the requirements demanded by the regulations in force.

The installation of this type of device must have the mandatory sign
informative, indicating the purposes and responsible for the treatment in your case of the data
of a personal nature.

In any case, the cameras must be oriented towards the particular space,
avoiding intimidating neighboring neighbors with this type of device, as well as
control traffic areas of the same without just cause.

Also with this type of device it is not possible to obtain image(s) of space
public, as this is the exclusive competence of the Security Forces and Bodies of the

Condition.

It should be remembered that even in the case of a "simulated" camera, the same
should preferably be oriented towards private space, since it is considered
that this type of device can affect the privacy of third parties, which are seen

intimidated by it in the belief of being the subject of permanent recording.

       On the part of individuals, it is not possible to install devices for obtaining
images of public space and/or transit of third parties, outside the cases allowed in
the normative.

       The purpose of this type of device must be the security of the property and of
its inhabitants, avoiding the affectation of rights of third parties that are seen
intimidated by them.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/7

                                           III

On 07/21/22, a written statement of allegations from the respondent was received, expressed in
essence that the system conforms to current legislation, being the same duly
informed by means of an informative poster in this regard.

       In support of his argument, he provides documentary evidence that proves the
orientation of the camera and the presence of an informative poster where the information about the

presence of it.

       Examining the photographs provided, an excessive uptake of
public space close to the area of his private property in the two chambers
installed, with which the capture made is considered disproportionate.

       In the case of the camera oriented towards the “garage” area, it is enough to limit
the space towards the door area and a small portion of public space,
while in the case of the camera on the facade of the property, it should be limited to
private space of the same, avoiding through the masking affect the area
traffic nearby.

       It should be remembered that the installation of this type of device by
individuals must be carried out in strict compliance with the current legal framework,
especially when he had already been warned by this body, for some facts
similar that had involved an analysis of the requirements in terms of video-

surveillance.

       The intended purpose of the system is perfectly compatible with the
limitation of the angle of the cameras towards their exclusive private area, so
that the impact towards the traffic zone next to the property is minimized (eg.

contributing new images to this organism).

       Any action that may involve a criminal act on the property
of the claimed party is fulfilled with the exclusive capture of his private property, for
example by obtaining images of the access area, being unnecessary
a control of the transit area near the house.

       The claimed party must answer about all the cameras installed in
especially those located in a transit area on a facade of the house (Doc. nº 1
Written claim) on which he omits any comment, which was clearly
facing public transit area.

       The known facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the party
claimed, for violation of the content of art. 5.1 c) RGPD, as they are the same
disproportionately directed towards public and/or private space of third parties.

                                           IV

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/7

The art. 83.5 RGPD provides the following: “Infringements of the provisions
following will be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines
EUR 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount

equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the
previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:

       a) The basic principles for the treatment including the conditions for the
           consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9 (...)”.

In the present case, it is taken into account that it is an individual, although the same
was already warned by this body (\*\*\*PROCEDURE.1) of the need to
report the presence of video-surveillance cameras, so it must be
aware of the requirements made, being a system that is affecting
areas that exceed their private space, reason that justifies imposing a sanction

€1,000 for violation of art. 5.1 c) RGPD, by having a camera system
oriented towards public and/or private space without just cause, sanction located in
the lower scale for this type of behavior, but taking into account the
negligent conduct of the defendant.

                                          SAW

The text of the resolution establishes the infractions committed and
the facts that have given rise to the violation of the regulations for the protection of
data, from which it is clearly inferred what measures to adopt, without prejudice
that the type of specific procedures, mechanisms or instruments for

implement them corresponds to the sanctioned party, since it is responsible for the
treatment who fully knows your organization and has to decide, based on the
proactive responsibility and risk approach, how to comply with the RGPD and the
LOPDGDD.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE B.B.B., with NIF \*\*\*NIF.1, for an infraction of Article 5.1.c)

of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, a fine of €1,000 (one thousand euros).

SECOND: ORDER compliance within ONE MONTH of the following
corrective measures, in accordance with article 58.2 RGPD:

       -Proceed to mask the cameras so that space is not captured
any public, limited to their private property.

       -Removal of any camera that affects the transit area, accrediting such
before this Agency through documentary evidence (eg photography).
