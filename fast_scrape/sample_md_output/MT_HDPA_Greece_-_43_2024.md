## English Summary

### Facts

On 3 May 2023, utilising its investigative powers, the Greek DPA sent a questionnaire to 31 public authorities, including the Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection (Controller), to assess the appointment and role of their DPO. The Controller failed to respond to the questionnaire on time, prompting the DPA to review its archives. It discovered no records of an appointed DPO and found that the Controller had not disclosed the DPO's contact details, as required under [Article 37(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#1 "Article 37 GDPR") and [Article 37(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#7 "Article 37 GDPR").

The DPA summoned the Controller to an official hearing, where it admitted that no DPO had been appointed. It argued that this was due to organizational changes between ministries, resource constraints, and reliance on an external consultancy firm to assist with data protection matters. The DPA also determined that the Ministry’s website lacked any information regarding a designated DPO.

### Holding

After its investigation, the DPA concluded that:

*   The Controller violated [Article 31 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_31_GDPR "Article 31 GDPR") by failing to respond to the questionnaire in a timely manner.
*   No DPO had been appointed since the Ministry's establishment [Article 37 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR"). A DPO was appointed only after the DPA demanded explanations, and this appointment covered the General Administration rather than the Ministry itself.
*   The Ministry breached the principle of accountability [Article 5 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") by:

1.  Failing to appoint a DPO as required [Article 37 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR").
2.  Failing to provide clear and transparent information to data subjects about their rights [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR").
3.  Not implementing measures to ensure GDPR-compliant data processing [Article 25 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR "Article 25 GDPR").
4.  Lacking a Register of Processing Activities [Article 30 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_30_GDPR "Article 30 GDPR").
5.  For failing to take or implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security against risks [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR")

These failures resulted in a violation of the GDPR’s principle of lawfulness [Article 5(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1 "Article 5 GDPR").

The DPA considered several factors when determining the penalty, including the number of violations, their duration (dating back to the Ministry's establishment in 2021), the Controller’s failure to self-disclose these violations, and the fact that the Controller operates at a national level. As a result, the DPA imposed a total fine of €50,000.

## Comment

This decision serves as a clear example of how the investigative powers granted to the DPA can be highly effective in uncovering violations while simultaneously promoting the enforcement and implementation of the GDPR.

The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 to determine the information to be presented with the icons and the procedures for providing standardized icons.' 10. Because according to the definitions of article 25 of the GDPR: "...2. The data controller implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, only the personal data necessary for the purpose of the processing are processed. This obligation applies to the scope of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, their storage period and their accessibility. In particular, the said measures ensure that, by definition, personal data is not made accessible without the intervention of the natural person to an indefinite number of natural persons..." 11. Because according to the definitions of article 30 of the GDPR: "1. Each data controller and, where applicable, its representative, shall keep a record of the processing activities for which it is responsible. This file shall include all of the following information: a) the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's representative and the data protection officer, b) the purposes of the processing, c) description of the categories of data subjects and the categories of personal data, d) the categories of recipients to whom the personal data is to be disclosed or has been disclosed, including recipients in third countries or international organizations, e) where appropriate, transfers of personal data to a third country or international organization, including the identification of said third country or international organization and, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 49 11 paragraph 1 second subparagraph, the documentation of the appropriate guarantees, f) where possible, the prescribed deadlines for the deletion of the various categories of data, g) where possible, a general description of the techniques and organizational security measures referred to in article 32 paragraph 1.,..., 3. The records referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 exist in writing, including in electronic form. 4. The controller or the processor and, where appropriate, the representative of the controller or the processor shall make the file available to the supervisory authority upon request....' 12. Because according to the definitions of Article 32 of the GDPR: "1. Taking into account the latest developments, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of different probability of occurrence and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the executor the processing implements appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure the appropriate level of security against risks, including, among others, where appropriate: a) pseudonymization and encryption of personnel data nature, b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and reliability of processing systems and services on a continuous basis, c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in case of physical or technical event, d) procedure for the regular testing, assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing. 2. When assessing the appropriate level of security, particular account shall be taken of the risks arising from the processing, in particular of accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise submitted to processing.,..." 13. Because in this case, from the data in the case file, it initially appears that the data controller did not timely proceed with the submission of the above questionnaire in violation of article 31 of the GDPR. 14. Because in addition, it was found that the controller had not set a DPO 12 since its establishment. Following the call to the Authority, the data controller appointed a DPO for the entire General Secretariat, mentioning at the same time the existence of the designated DPO for the PS, without, however, having disclosed their details to the Authority, nor having posted the relevant necessary information on the website communication, while no DPO has been designated for the Ministry as a whole as a data controller. During the calls and also in his memos, the controller referred to issues of resources and coverage of functional positions1. 15. Because the data controller had not, since its establishment, complied with the GDPR, and in particular with the provisions of Chapters 3 and 4 of the GDPR, as it had an obligation based on the principle of accountability, while as can be seen from the history of the present, the controller simply invoked the fact that it is a newly established Ministry and therefore had not had time to comply with the requirements of the GDPR, and proceeded to conclude contract with an external partner for the purpose of the above compliance following the call from the Authority. In particular, the data controller had not taken the appropriate measures to provide the subjects with transparent information regarding their rights, as well as a facility for exercising them, as provided for in Article 12 of the GDPR. In addition, the data controller had not taken and implemented appropriate organizational measures for the protection of personal data and in particular to ensure the processing of personal data during planning and by definition for the personal data that are necessary for the respective purpose of processing, as provided for in Article 25 of the GDPR. Besides, the data controller had not proceeded to maintain the record of activities as provided for by article 30 of the GDPR. In addition, the controller had not taken and implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure the appropriate level of security against risks, in accordance with the requirements of Article 32 of the GDPR. 16. Since, as can be seen from the above, violations of articles 12, 32, 25 and 30 were found, a violation of the principles of legality such as those 1 See recent CJEU decision in case C-184/20 - Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisij (Dec. 89): "However, it must be emphasized that the lack of resources available to public authorities cannot under any circumstances constitute a legitimate reason capable of justifying an infringement of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter" 13 are described in article 5 par. 1 pc. a', 5 par. 1 paragraph 3 and 5 par. 1 pc. f, given that the violation of the controller's obligations for transparent information, for data protection by design and by default and for security as well as for keeping records of activities derive from the above principles of Article 5 and document a violation of these. 17. Because, based on the above, the Authority finds the following: a. Violation of article 31 regarding the cooperation of the controller with the Authority. b. Violation of article 37 regarding the non-appointment of a DPO. c. Violation of article 12 regarding transparent information, announcement and arrangements for the exercise of the data subject's rights and article 32 par. 1 and par. 2 regarding the security of processing in conjunction with article 5 par. 1 pc. a', 5 par. 1 pc. c and 5 par. 1 pc. f regarding transparency, minimization, integrity and confidentiality of data. d. Violation of Article 25 regarding data protection by design and by default. e. Violation of article 30 regarding keeping a record of activities. 18. Because based on the above, the Authority considers that there is a case of exercise of the Article 58 par. 2 GDPR of its corrective powers and the imposition of administrative sanctions in relation to the identified violations. 19. Because the Authority further judges that, based on the violations found, it should be imposed, pursuant to the provision of article 58 par. 2 pcs. i GDPR, effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative fine, in accordance with articles 83 GDPR and 39 of Law 4624/2019, to the controller.
20. Because the Authority further took into account the criteria for measuring the fine which
are defined in article 83, par. 2 of the GDPR, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the same article
that apply to the present case, article 39 par. 1 and 2 of n. 4624 where
concerns the imposition of administrative sanctions on public sector bodies and
Guidelines 04/2022 of the European Protection Council
14 Data2 for the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR which
approved on 5/24/2023 and its facts/data
of the case under consideration and in particular the following:
i) The fact that the controller, as a public body, did not have
designate a DPO from its constitution despite the obligation it has, with
resulting in the violation lasting a long time, even with the recent one
DPO definition in the General Secretariat remains the lack of a DPO definition for
the Ministry as controller.
ii) The fact that the controller has not complied with the GDPR
from its establishment, despite the obligation it has, as a result of
offense to have a long duration.
iii) The fact that the controller did not notify the
above violations to the Authority, but instead the Authority was informed
through the control it carried out in the context of the coordinated
action.
iv) The fact that the controller operates nationally
level increases the severity of the processing extent.
v) The fact that it cannot be ascertained whether material damage has occurred for the
data subjects, as well as the number of possibly
affected data subjects.
vi) The fact that the controller has shown reluctance to
cooperation with the Authority, failing to provide them in time
information requested of him.
vii) The fact that, although late, the controller submitted
finally the above questionnaire.
viii) The fact that no previous corresponding violation has been established
cooperation with the Authority by the controller.
The Authority considers that, based on the violations found, the sanction that
referred to in the operative part of the decision is the effective, proportional and
preventive measure to restore compliance,
