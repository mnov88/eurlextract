## English Summary

### Facts

After a complaint from a data subject, the Romanian DPA started an investigation against the controller Actamedica SRL. The investigation found that the controller, a medical centre, has previously informed the data subject about losing their biological samples and a sum of money sent by a courier. When the data subject sent a request asking which other personal data has been exposed and if the national DPA had been notified, the controller suggested that the data subject contact the company lawyer and address any other complaints with the courier company.

### Holding

During the investigation, the DPA found that the controller did not take sufficient security measures appropriate to the risk of processing. This lead to a security incident, in breach of Article 28(1) and 32 GDPR, for which the controller was fined RON 9,836.6 (approximately €2,000).

Additionally, the DPA found that it had not been notified with regards to the security incident, in breach of Article 33 GDPR, for which the controller was fined RON 4,918.3 (approximately €1,000).

Furthermore, the DPA found that the controller did not respond to the data subject's request asking which other personal data has been exposed, in breach of Article 12(3) and 15(1) GDPR, for which the controller has been given a warning.

Finally, the Romanian DPA applied two corrective measures on the controller, asking it to implement appropriate security measures and to answer the data subject request.
