## English Summary

### Facts

In April 2020, after being notified by the IT company C-Planet (the controller), the Maltese DPA opened an ex officio investigation into the a personal data breach of approximately 335,000 eligible voters on the island. That same year, noyb filed a complaint on behalf of several data subjects affected by the data breach ([CDP/DBN/31/2020](/index.php?title=IDPC_\(Malta\)_-_CDP/DBN/31/2020 "IDPC (Malta) - CDP/DBN/31/2020")). Following this complaint, the DPA ruled that C-Planet, in its capacity as controller, infringed several provisions of the GDPR.

In particular, the DPA found that: a) the processing of personal data, including special categories, lacked a legal basis, in breach of [Articles 6(1)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") and [9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#1 "Article 9 GDPR"); b) the controller failed to adequately inform data subjects about the processing of their data, in violation of [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"); c) the controller failed to notify the DPA within 72 hours, in violation of [Articles 33](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"); d) the controller failed to implement sufficient technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks involved, violating [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

In January 2022, noyb, on behalf of a data subject, request access to personal data, asking the controller to inform what personal data it held and what was the source of these data, pursuant to [Article 15(1)(g) GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1g "Article 15 GDPR") In response, the controller stated that it was no longer in possession of the leaked data, which was now with the Maltese Police and DPA. Furthermore, it invoked [Article 23 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_23_GDPR "Article 23 GDPR") to limit the data subject's right to access on the grounds that there was an ongoing criminal investigation and civil action.

In April 2022, noyb filed the present complaint (COMP/138/2022), claiming that the controller refused to inform that data subject about the source of the data it processed without having collected it directly from them. According to noyb, the controller violated [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"). In the procedure before the DPA, the controller maintained its position.

### Holding

Initially, the DPA emphasized that it had already been well established in its previous decision that C-Planet acted in its capacity of a controller within the meaning of article [4(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#7 "Article 4 GDPR") in relation to the personal data breach. Moreover, it highlighted that it is the controller and not the processor who can invoke [Article 23 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_23_GDPR "Article 23 GDPR") to restrict a data protection right. The DPA found that, by invoking this article, C-Planet acknowledges being the controller and admits to still being in possession of the data, as it would not be possible to restrict the right of access to data that it does not have.

Then, the DPA clarified that [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") must be interpreted in light of the fundamental right guaranteed by the Charter, in connection with the spirit and scope of the law, which are specifically intended to provide a high level of protection of personal data. It referred to CJEU case-law to point out that the aim of this provision is to ensure transparency and, thus, allow data subjects to exercise their rights. Therefore, it stated that the controller should provide a copy of the personal data it held, including any information in relation to the source of these data.

Finally, the DPA recognized that data protection is not an absolute right. However, in accordance with CJEU case-law, limitations to this fundamental right must be provided for by law, respect the essence of rights and freedoms, and be necessary and proportionate to genuinely satisfy objectives of general interest or the need to protect the rights and freedoms from others. Pursuant to [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"), the controller must provide concrete reasons for restricting a fundamental right (in the case at hand, denying access to a data subject). In present case, the DPA found that the controller only referred to criminal investigations and pending legal proceedings, without specifying the reasons why the disclosure of personal data would jeopardize them. For this reason, the DPA concluded that the restrictions invoked by the controller did not respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject and do not constitute a necessary and proportionate measure.

On the basis of the foregoing considerations, the DPA held that the controller infringed [Articles 15(1)](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR") and [15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3 "Article 15 GDPR") by failing to provide the data subject with a copy of her personal data. As a result, it issued a reprimand and ordered the controller to fully comply with the request under penalty of being fined.
