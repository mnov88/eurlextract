The High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland Queen's Bench Division denied the application for judicial review of an app used for checking vaccination status, since the applicant's unvaccinated status precluded them from being a data subject with regards to the app, and thus lacked legal standing to challenge its usage.

## English Summary

### Facts

The applicant, Darren Williams, who was unvaccinated, challenged the lawfulness of using Covid Cert Check NI App to check people’s vaccination status before granting them entry into public places.

### Holding

The court refused to grant leave to apply for judicial review on the grounds that the applicant was not a data subject for the app. It argued that as someone who had not been vaccinated, the applicant would never be subject to the processing about which he complained. Therefore, he had no legal standing.

The court further observed that the question whether or not the data processing by the app is necessary has substance. However, the court did not deem it fit to answer the question as elected representatives are best suited to assess public interest such as the public health interests in question.
