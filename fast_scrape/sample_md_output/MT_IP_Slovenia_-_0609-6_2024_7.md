## English Summary

### Facts

A responsible person, while employed at a certain company, unlawfully processed the personal data of two individuals. This included their e-mail addresses and the traffic data of the e-mails sent to those addresses during a specified period. Despite the termination of the individuals' employment, the responsible person continued to process their personal data, directing e-mails sent to their addresses to her own e-mail address without proper legal basis or individual consent.

### Holding

The DPA held that the responsible person is found in violation of [Article 8(1) of the the Slovenian Data Protection Law ('ZVOP-1')](https://zakonodaja.com/zakon/zvop-1/8-clen-splosna-opredelitev) according to which the personal data may only be processed if so provided by law or if the processing is subject to the consent of the data subject.

Importantly, these offenses were committed within the scope of the responsible person's business activities and on behalf of the legal entity she represented. According [Article 91(1)(2) ZVOP-1](https://zakonodaja.com/zakon/zvop-1/91-clen-splosne-krsitve-dolocb-tega-zakona), such responsible personal must also be held liable for offences committed.

The DPA decided that the legal entity is also held liable for the same breach of [Article 8(1) of the Slovenian Data Protection Law](https://zakonodaja.com/zakon/zvop-1/8-clen-splosna-opredelitev) as the offence was committed within the scope of its business activities and on its behalf.

As a result, the DPA imposed a fine of €300 to the responsible person of the legal entity and another fine of €6,255 to the legal entity.

## Comment

Article 8(1) ZVOP-1

(1) Personal data may only be processed if the processing of personal data and the personal data to be processed is provided for by law or if the processing of certain personal data is subject to the personal consent of the data subject.

Article 91(2) ZVOP-1

(1) A fine of between EUR 4,170 and EUR 12,510 is imposed on a legal person, a sole proprietor or an individual carrying out an activity independently:

2. entrusting another person with specific tasks relating to the processing of personal data without concluding a contract in accordance with Article 11(2);

     be sent by post or delivered directly in duplicate and shall be deemed to be in time if it is lodged on the last
     day of the period for lodging the statement of claim by registered post or directly with the authority which

                                                                                                                  3     issued the decision. An application for judicial protection which has been lodged may be withdrawn until the

withdraws the application, he or she shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to applyfor judicial protection.

     request, a written decision on the offence, stating the reasons for the decision, shall be drawn up and
     dispatched not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the announcement of the request for judicial

     protection. The reasoned decision shall in that case be served on all persons entitled to apply for judicial
     protection.

The offender who fails to notify an application for judicial protection against the decision on the offence shall

pay half of the fine imposed within eight (8) days of the expiry of the time limit for notification of the
application for judicial protection (half of the fine is EUR 150.00 for ... and EUR 3 127.50 for ...), otherwise
he shall pay the full amount of the fine imposed within the time limit set out in the operative part of this Decision.
