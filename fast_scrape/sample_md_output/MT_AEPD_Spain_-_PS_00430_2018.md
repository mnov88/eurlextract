## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was party to a workplace harassment suit against the mayor and lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) after the mayor posted the unredacted court decision on his personal Facebook page, in combination with other personal data concerning the data subject.

The mayor claimed the posting of the data subject’s personal data was covered by Article 6(1)(f) as a legal basis.

In their investigation, the DPA assessed whether the City Council was a controller or joint-controller for the data, and thus could be party to the complaint.

### Holding

In its decision, the DPA highlighted that the City Council was the owner of the files containing personal data related to development of labour relations. However, the DPA emphasized that a distinction must be made between the processing carried out by the City Council and the individuals who act on their instructions, and individuals who belongs to the City Council but act independently.

With that in mind, the DPA concluded that the City Council did not determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data on the mayor's Facebook page. As such, the DPA declared that the City Council was not responsible for the alleged infringement of [Article 6(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

RIGHTS OF LAW
I
Under the powers that Article 58.2 of the GDPR recognizes each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.
II
To analyze the infringement charged, we start from the principle of publicity of the
judicial proceedings, constitutionalized by art. 120.1 CE, and to which reference is made
in different precepts of the Organic Law of the Judiciary (articles 232, 234, 235 and
266.1). Article 232 LOPJ states " 1 The judicial proceedings shall be public, with the
exceptions established by the laws of procedure.
2. Exceptionally, for reasons of public order and protection of rights and
liberties, Judges and Courts, may by reasoned resolution limit the scope
of advertising and agree on the secret nature of all or part of the actions ".
Article 234 LOPJ prescribes " The Secretaries and competent personnel of the
Courts and Tribunals will provide interested parties how much information they request about the
status of legal proceedings, which they may examine and know, unless they are or
would have been declared secret according to the law. In the same cases, the

testimonies requested, with the expression of the addressee, except in cases where the
law provide otherwise . "
Article 235 LOPJ refers to access by interested parties to books, files and
judicial records that are not reserved and article 266 indicates that
will allow any interested party access to the sentence text.
The STS of March 3, 1995, appeal 1218/1991, states in relation to the
publicity of judicial proceedings ".. that the right and correlative duty of
knowledge and access to the text of court decisions is graduated based on three
various areas or spheres of involvement, each governed by various criteria, namely: a)
one of maximum amplitude or generalized affectation, which includes the public or
citizens in general, without specific qualification and that corresponds to the publicity of the
judicial proceedings developed in all kinds of processes, which allows those
go to the practice of errands that must take place "at a public hearing", except for the
Reservation statement that the court organizes by reason, principle of
constitutionalized advertising in art. 120.1 of the Fundamental Standard and which includes art.
232.1 of the Organic Law.
b) at the opposite extreme, of maximum restriction of the scope of knowledge of the
judicial decisions, are the acts of notification and communication of these, directed
only to those who have the status of procedural part under the laws of
procedure, and that as regards the sentences determine the right and correlative duty
of the Judges and Courts to their knowledge through the instrumental act of notification,
as prescribed by art. 270 LOPJ.
c) occupying an intermediate position that places the issue in a more imprecise scope,
find the procedural actions already completed, including sentences, integrated into
books, archives or judicial records, and in respect of which, on the one hand, art. 235 LOPJ
determines that: «the interested parties will have access to the books, archives and judicial records
that are not reserved, through the forms of exhibition, testimony or
certification established by law »
Regarding the quality of the interested party for the purposes described, it is specified in the
said judgment that " the legitimate interest that is enforceable in the case, can only be recognized
in whom, natural or legal person, manifests and accredits, at least prima facie, before the

as a mediating activity, to satisfy the rights or interests of third parties, and in
consequence acquires, as is the case, an aspect of globality or generality by

legal system and its applicators, in general, as otherwise it would be

The doctrine established in said judgment has been reiterated in the SSTS of 22 of
May 1996 and April 6, 2001, resource 9448/1996.

Also the SAN (1st) of November 29, 2001, resource 531/2000 echoes the
doctrine set by the aforementioned STS of March 3, 1995, and states that " the data contained
in books and judicial records they are not publicly available
entirely free and indiscriminate since access to them is regulated and in certain
restricted measure. On the one hand, by the appeal made by the aforementioned articles 235 and
2666.1 of the Organic Law of the Judiciary on the condition of "interested", of whose
significance and scope we already know the jurisprudential interpretation. On the other hand, because
access to such books and files is mediated by the necessary intervention of the
Judicial Secretary and the mandatory subject to the application process and authorization regulated in
Articles 1 to 5 of Regulation 5/1995, of June 7, of the General Council of Power
Judicial, on accessory aspects of judicial proceedings . "
That is, and for what we are interested in here, the publicity of the judicial proceedings does not
means that the data contained in a judicial proceeding that is in the phase of
execution, can be examined and are available to the general public of
totally free and indiscriminate, but that advertising is restricted except
those actions held in public hearing to those who hold the condition
of "interested parties", to which article 234 LOPJ appeals. This concept of interested, not
it necessarily coincides with that of the procedural part and which has been outlined by the
jurisprudence in the sense described above.
To finish with the examination of jurisprudence and regulations on this matter
It should be noted that the jurisprudential criteria set forth is consistent with the position
maintained by the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court when weighting the publicity of the sen-

decision of the courts and their performance according to law, as these principles
are reinforced by knowledge of the actions of the courts by citizens,
and should be considered closely linked to the protection of fundamental rights
inherent in the exercise of jurisdictional power by judges and courts.
This advertising can only be restricted or limited, as established
in the law, when it may entail the impairment of a fundamental right of citizens
give us affected or a constitutionally protected good, especially when the
knowledge of the private data contained in the judgment may lead to
the disclosure of aspects of privacy that should be protected, provided that
This disclosure is not protected by the right to information within the framework of the
Free public munication proper to a democratic society.
In effect, according to STC 57/2004, of April 19, FJ 5 (in the same sense,
pecto of the publication of the sentences of the Constitutional Court, ATC 516/2004, of 20
December, FJ 1, and STC 114/2006, FJ 7), the principles of weighting and proportional-
can lead to the conclusion that other fundamental rights or property with
Constitutional protection must take precedence over the publicity of judgments
Cial
This principle is applied by article 266.1 II LOPJ, introduced by LO
19/2003, of December 23, according to which «\[e\] l access to the text of the sentences, or from
finished ends thereof, may be restricted when it could
affect the right to privacy, the rights of people who require a special

duty of guardianship or the guarantee of anonymity of the victims or injured parties, when appropriate
it gives, as well as, in general, to prevent sentences from being used with
nes contrary to the laws.
When the publication of a judicial resolution may affect the honor of the person
na that has obtained an unfavorable result in the process, it is necessary to determine whether

recognized by the legal system (art. 2.2 LPDH: «The existence of
illegitimate interference in the protected area when expressly authorized by
law").
The contrast between the right to honor and the right to publicize the content of the
judgment, which results from the principle of publicity, should result in a weighting in the

Advertising principle pursues. This aspect, in turn, requires taking into account the

tada, beyond what objectively implies in the field of reputation the failure of
an action or opposition held before the courts of justice.
Well, it is clear that the principle of publicity of sentences that contain
templa our LOPJ is not absolute, but finds limits, either by referring to
who hold the status of interested parties or because of the prevalence of other rights
or goods that enjoy constitutional protection, as with the right to protection
of data, the latter issue that has been examined in the foundation of previous law.
Finally, it should be noted that the constitutional doctrine contained in the STC
114/2006, of April 5, only confirms what has been exposed so far, because in it the Tri-
Constitutional bunal is limited to extract from a joint reading of articles 120 and 164.1
EC and Articles 86.2 and 99.2 LOTC - in its wording prior to the reform operated by the
Organic Law 6/2007, of May 24-, placed in relation to Articles 9.1 CE and 5.1
LOPJ, a constitutional requirement for maximum dissemination and publicity of the full content of
the jurisdictional resolutions of that Court that incorporate constitutional doctrine, which
it is specified, on the one hand, in the formal obligation to publish such resolutions in the
Official Gazette, and in a material obligation to give greater accessibility and public dissemination
to their content, regardless of their nature and the process in which they
dictate and, on the other, in that the publicity and diffusion has to affect the entire resolution.
It is significant that for this the Constitutional Court is especially supported
in art. 164.1 CE establishes, which preaches it establishes, beyond even the principle
general publicity of judicial proceedings and their resolutions of art. 120 CE, one
specific constitutional requirement for maximum dissemination and publicity of legal resolutions
of this Court.
Moreover, it highlights the nuances that differentiate the principle of publicity from sentences.
Cias of the Constitutional Court of the judgments of the Judiciary, by limiting the
Applicability to that of the regime established in this regard by the LOPJ, stating the following:

 “Being evident that the possibility itself, foreseen in art. 266.1 LOPJ, to restrict total-
mind the access to the text of a Judgment could be problematic, as far as
to the Constitutional Judgments, thanks to the obligation of their formal publication in the Bo-

Therefore, again this doctrine redirects the controversial issue to the
interest weighting. 
The claims of the defendant, although it can be understood in an accusing tone,
they do not suggest a response outside the law by presenting the sentence on the social network
