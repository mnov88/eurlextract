## English Summary

### Facts

Alianța pentru Unirea Românilor (AUR, the controller) is a Romanian political party. The data subjects were natural persons who either registered on the controller’s campaign websites or used its mobile application.

In early 2025, the controller submitted two personal data breach notifications under [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR") to the Romanian National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing (ANSPDCP). The DPA also received additional complaints from individuals regarding the controller’s data processing practices.

The first incident concerned the controller’s mobile application, aur.mobi. A misconfiguration allowed unauthorised third-party access to the app’s source code. As a result, personal data of users (including name, phone number, email address, home address, national ID number, date of birth, nationality, citizenship, sex, religion, profession, education history, political experience, and spoken languages) were accessible without authentication.

In parallel, the DPA investigated the controller’s operation of two campaign websites, semnezsivotez.ro and semnezsivotez.org, used to collect personal data for political outreach and statistical analysis. The controller collected data such as name, national ID card number, address, date of birth, email, phone number, and handwritten signature from a large number of individuals. The controller did not provide a valid legal basis under [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"), nor were the data minimised in accordance with [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR").

During the investigation, the controller took both websites offline.

### Holding

First, the Romanian DPA held that the controller had violated [Article 32(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1b "Article 32 GDPR"), [Article 32 (1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1d "Article 32 GDPR"), and [Article 32(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#2 "Article 32 GDPR"), in conjunction with [Article 25(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#1 "Article 25 GDPR") and [Article 25(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#2 "Article 25 GDPR"). The DPA found that the controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the confidentiality and security of personal data processed through the aur.mobi application. The vulnerability allowed unauthorised access to the app’s source code, exposing a broad range of highly sensitive personal data. The DPA noted that the controller lacked effective access controls and did not establish a regular testing and review process to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures.

Second, the DPA found that the controller had unlawfully processed personal data via the campaign websites semnezsivotez.ro and semnezsivotez.org, in breach of [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"), read in conjunction with [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"). The controller collected excessive personal data from individuals without demonstrating a valid legal basis. The data processed were neither adequate nor limited to what was necessary in relation to the purposes declared, namely political campaigning and statistical analysis.

As a result, the Romanian DPA imposed two administrative fines on the controller: one of RON 50,587 (€10,000) and another of RON 75,880.50 (€15,000), amounting to a total of RON 126,467.50 (€25,000).

## English Machine Translation of the Decision

The decision below is a machine translation of the Romanian original. Please refer to the Romanian original for more details.

07.07.2025 Sanction for non-compliance with the GDPR

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in June 2025, an investigation at the operator of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians Party (AUR) and found a violation of the provisions of:

         a) art. 32 para. (1) let. b) and d) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in conjunction with art. 25 para. (1) and (2) of the same regulatory act;

          b) art. 5 para. (1) let. c) and para. (2), in relation to the provisions of art. 6 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  

For the acts committed, the following sanctions were applied to the operator:

         a) fine, in the amount of 50,587.00 lei, the equivalent in lei of the amount of 10,000 euros

         b) fine, in the amount of 75,880.50 lei, the equivalent in lei of the amount of 15,000 euros

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians Party (AUR) of two notifications regarding the breach of personal data security, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as following some notifications received by the Authority.

a) One of the notified security breaches concerned the aur.mobi application used and managed by the operator, whose vulnerability was exploited by a third party by accessing the source code of the application.

The investigation found that, due to a configuration error, at the time of the incident, the following categories of personal data of its users (supporters/members, individuals who provided personal data in the operator's application) could be viewed in the aur.mobi application: first and last name, telephone number, e-mail address, residence address, personal identification number, date of birth, nationality, citizenship, gender, religion, profession, occupation, field of activity, experience in other fields, studies (institution, specialization, start date, end date), political experience (party, position, start date, end date), administrative experience (institution, position, start date, end date), foreign languages spoken (language, level).

Therefore, it was found that the operator violated the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) letters b) and d) and para. (2), in conjunction with art. 25 para. (1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016, since it did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, personal data cannot be accessed, without the intervention of the person, by an unlimited number of persons, including the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality and resilience of the processing systems and services, as well as a process for periodically testing, evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the processing, respectively, it did not implement, both when establishing the means of processing and during the processing itself, such appropriate technical and organizational measures. This led to the unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access to the personal data of the application users (supporters/members of the AUR party), by accessing the source code of the aur.mobi application by third parties, as a result of querying a vulnerable programming interface.

b) The Permanent Electoral Authority forwarded two notifications to the National Supervisory Authority reporting a possible violation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by the AUR operator, by collecting personal data (surname, first name, ID number and series, home address, date of birth, email, telephone number, signature) through the platforms www.semnezsivotez.org and www.semnezsivotez.ro for a significant number of data subjects.

During the investigation, it was found that the personal data were processed by the operator for the purpose of informing the data subjects about an AUR campaign and for statistical purposes, as well as that the processed data are not adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the declared purposes of the processing.

As such, it was found that the operator violated the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) letter c) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in relation to the provisions of art. 6 par. (1) of the Regulation, since it processed without legal basis, through the websites semnezsivotez.ro and semnezsivotez.org, personal data that are not adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary, in relation to the declared purposes of the processing.

During the investigation, the operator deactivated the IT platforms semnezsivotez.ro and semnezsivotez.org.
