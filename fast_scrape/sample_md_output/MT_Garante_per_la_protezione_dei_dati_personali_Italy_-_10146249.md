## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was a public officer. In 2020 he came under investigation for alleged offences related to the trade of face masks during the covid emergency. During the proceedings he was subjected to home arrest as a precautionary measure. News outlet Milano Finanza, owned by MF Service S.r.l. (the controller), covered the investigation and reported that the data subject was under home arrest.

In 2023 the criminal court revoked the home arrest. The criminal proceedings were not yet settled (and were still pending at the time of the DPA’s decision, two years later).

In 2024 the data subject requested the controller to de-index an article about the legal proceedings against him. The controller refused to erase the article and instead updated it to clarify that the data subject was no longer under house arrest. The data subject then filed a complaint to challenge the controller’s refusal.

### Holding

The DPA denied the data subject’s request on grounds that the article (in its updated version) was both accurate and up to date. The GDPR further considered that news about the proceedings was of public interest due to the data subject's position as a public officer.

The DPA also clarified that precautionary measures (as well as their revocation) do not, by definition, close legal proceedings. Therefore, the data subject's legal position (i.e.: being suspected of, and investigated for, a criminal offence) did not change when home arrest was revoked.

Measure of April 29, 2025

Register of Measures
no. 254 of April 29, 2025

THE ITALIAN DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY

IN today's meeting, attended by Professor Pasquale Stanzione, President, Professor Ginevra Cerrina Feroni, Vice President, Dr. Agostino Ghiglia and Guido Scorza, members, and Dr. Claudio Filippi, Acting Secretary General;

HAVING REGARD TO Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter the "Regulation");

HAVING SEEN the Personal Data Protection Code containing provisions for the adaptation of national legislation to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Legislative Decree No. 196 of 30 June 2003, as amended by Legislative Decree No. 101 of 10 August 2018, hereinafter the "Code");

HAVING SEEN the complaint filed with the Data Protection Authority, pursuant to Article 77 of the Regulation, on 24 September 2024, in which Mr. XX, represented and defended by Mr. XX, requested that MF Service S.r.l., as publisher of the newspaper "Milano Finanza" (hereinafter also "MF Service" or the "Data Controller"), de-index the URL https://... found in association with the search term "XX" and correct the information contained therein, pursuant to Article 77 of the Regulation. 16 of the Regulation, "giving account, in the opening lines of the article and with an amended title, of the annulment of the measure ordered against \[him\] \[...\]" in the context of the legal proceedings involving him;

WHEREAS the complainant was involved in the investigation, which began in 2020, into the procurement of masks during the pandemic while he was serving as XX; as part of this investigation, the precautionary measure of house arrest was imposed on the interested party;

WHEREAS, in particular, the complainant has submitted that:

- the precautionary measure of house arrest ordered against him in the context of the aforementioned investigation was annulled in July 2023 by the competent Court, "leading to a significant change in the legal proceedings, as well as in \[his\] procedural status";

- MF Service, in response to the request for de-indexing and rectification previously submitted on June 25, 2024, merely published "an aside within the article" complaining about the revocation of the precautionary measure, without highlighting it in the title;

- the action taken by the data controller, affecting the text of the article and not the title, is likely to provide "a misleading, outdated, and irrelevant representation," resulting in serious reputational damage to the data controller; indeed, "if the reader does not actually open the article and merely reads the title \[...\], he or she will be led to believe that XX is still subject to the measure of house arrest";

SEEN the note dated March 3, 2025, in which the Authority asked the data controller to provide its observations regarding the content of the complaint and whether it intended to comply with the data subject's requests;

SEEN the response received on March 20, 2025, in which MF Service stated:

- that it had updated the news item available at the URL indicated in the complaint by adding a brief informational note "not only in the subtitle, but \[...\] also at the beginning of the body of the text \[...\]" of the complained-of article;

- that it had changed the title of the editorial content in question, also doing so in relation to the header of the corresponding URL; so much so that both the title of the article and the corresponding URL contain information regarding the revocation of the precautionary measure imposed on the complainant, in compliance with the request in the initiating document;

- that it did not intend to de-index the complained-of article due to the public interest in the disclosure of the relevant news item, which is related to recent events and for which criminal proceedings against the complainant are still pending; Specifically, in its arguments, the data controller argued that "in consideration of the seriousness of the alleged crimes, the profession and qualifications of the complainant (in this case, a prominent and well-known public official), as well as the \[short\] period of time that has elapsed \[...\]," updating the news item was preferred over de-indexing the URL. This was also taken into account that "for the same facts that are the subject of the precautionary measure, \[Mr. XX\] has been indicted and is currently under criminal proceedings before XX.

CONSIDERING the communication received on April 8, 2025, in which the interested party—in response to MF Service's arguments—represented that the data controller's update concerns obsolete information, superseded by the recent order adopted by the competent Court (a copy of which he attached), which, on February 10, 2025, confirmed the revocation of the precautionary measure of house arrest, already ordered by order of July 7. 2023; this circumstance, in his opinion, would justify "a more incisive intervention \[by the owner\] that guarantees a real deletion or, at least, a substantial correction of the information that is no longer relevant \[...\]. Therefore \[...\] there is no justification whatsoever for the publisher's denial of the request for de-indexing of the news item.

WHEREAS, unless the act constitutes a more serious crime, anyone who, in proceedings before the Data Protection Authority, falsely declares or certifies information or circumstances, or produces false documents or records, is liable pursuant to Article 168 of the Code, "False declarations to the Data Protection Authority and interruption of the performance of the duties or exercise of the powers of the Data Protection Authority";

WHEREAS, based on what emerged during the preliminary investigation, that:

- the aforementioned order of February 10, 2025, with which the competent Court confirmed the revocation of the precautionary measure adopted on July 7, 2023, does not prove the conclusion of the criminal proceedings initiated against the appellant for the crimes attributed to him; indeed, a precautionary judgment, by definition, aims to crystallize - upon the occurrence of certain requirements identified According to the provisions of criminal procedural law, a specific legal situation is created pending the definitive conclusion of the proceedings from which it arose. Therefore, in the absence of further evidentiary evidence and procedural documents that irrefutably certify the favorable outcome of the judicial proceedings involving the applicant, the production of the aforementioned orders, issued by the Court of Review within the context of the same criminal plan initiated in 2020, would lead one to believe that the criminal proceedings against the applicant are continuing;

- the contested article concerns procedural matters for which, at present, it is not possible to assert with certainty their complete resolution, given the provisional nature of the orders of the Court of Review which, as mentioned, would suggest that the criminal proceedings against the applicant are currently pending; consequently, the relevant content, recently published (June 22, 2023), is of undoubted public interest, also taking into account the positions held by the applicant. institutional roles held by the complainant (XX);

- the owner has updated the article subject to the complaint by adopting adequate technical measures to immediately convey, in the title itself, the evolution of the procedural situation involving the complainant, providing notice of the revocation of the precautionary measure originally imposed on the complainant; consequently, the indexing of the complained URL links to an article that, in its exposition of the facts, provides a representation that is consistent with the procedural reality, without any distortion of the complainant's image;

CONSIDERING it necessary to clarify that requests for the correction of information deemed to be untrue may, if appropriate, be submitted to the publisher pursuant to Law No. 48 of 1947 (the so-called Press Law), but cannot be examined by the Authority, which may instead assess the different right of rectification pursuant to Article 16 of the Regulation;

CONSIDERING, therefore, that the request for rectification submitted by the complainant pursuant to Article 16 of the Regulation may be assessed by the Authority with exclusive reference to objectively detectable inaccurate data, such as the incorrect indication of a person's name (see Decision No. 28 of 27 January 2022, available at www.gpdp.it, web doc No. 9747522);

CONSIDERING that, since the complained article did not contain any inaccuracies in terms of objective circumstances and in light of the update on the developments of the complainant's legal position in the relevant text, the aforementioned right of rectification exercised in the preliminary ruling and in the document initiating the proceedings could not be invoked, but rather the different right to update pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 1, letter d), of the Regulation, which would also appear to imply the data subject's request and which, in any case, was found to have been fully satisfied by the data controller within the aforementioned terms;

NOTING that the complainant, if the matter Should the data subject find further positive evidence in his or her favor, he or she may exercise the right to update/integrate the data concerning him or her contained in the article in question, attaching appropriate supporting documentation;

HAVING ACKNOWLEDGED the measure taken by the data controller to update the article indicated in the complaint in question, both during the preliminary investigation and during the proceedings, taking care to extend this measure to both the title and the URL header, there are no grounds for taking further action;

CONSIDERING, in light of the above considerations, that the complaint must be declared unfounded with regard to the request for de-indexing of the aforementioned URL;

CONSIDERING the documentation in the file;

CONSIDERING the observations made by the acting Secretary General pursuant to Article 15 of the Regulation of the Guarantor No. 1/2000;

RAPPORTEUR Dr. Agostino Ghiglia;

NOW CONSIDERING ALL THE ABOVE, THE GUARANTOR

pursuant to Article 57, paragraph 1, letter (f) of the Regulation:

a) acknowledges the update made by the data controller regarding the article subject to the complaint and therefore believes that the conditions for the Authority to take further action in this regard are not met;

b) declares the complaint unfounded with regard to the request for de-indexing of the aforementioned URL for the reasons set out in the justification.

Pursuant to Article 78 of the Regulation, Articles 152 of the Code, and Article 10 of Legislative Decree No. 150 of September 1, 2011, an appeal against this decision may be lodged with the ordinary judicial authority, with an appeal filed either with the court of the place where the data controller resides or has its registered office or with the court of the place of residence of the interested party within thirty days of the date of notification of the decision itself, or sixty days if the appellant resides abroad.
