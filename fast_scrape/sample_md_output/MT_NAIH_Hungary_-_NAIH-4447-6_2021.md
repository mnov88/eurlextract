The Hungarian DPA held that a data subject was entitled to have their personal data deleted from recordings and transcripts of an open hearing at a Budapest district assembly. In particular, it considered the disclosure of their name and address during those meetings to be in breach of the principle of data minimisation.

## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject made a request for deletion with the mayoral office of a district in Budapest under [Article 17(1)(d)](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1d "Article 17 GDPR") of the GDPR. Previously, the data subject registered to ask a question from the elected representatives during an open hearing of the district assembly, but claimed not to be aware that this would lead to the public disclosure of their name and address.

They argued that disclosing this data during an open (online) hearing of the mayoral assembly, as well as including it in the publicly available meeting recording and transcript, without his explicit consent, was unlawful. The mayoral office refused the request for deletion, arguing that the processing was necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest under [Article 6(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e "Article 6 GDPR").

### Holding

The Hungarian DPA held that the processing of the data subject's data for the purpose of registering his request to ask a question during the assembly was lawful under [Article 6(1)(e)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e "Article 6 GDPR").

However, it also held that the disclosure of the data subject's name and address during the meeting, and subsequently in its recording and transcript, was a separate and unnecessary act of processing. As such, it would have required consent under [Article 6(1)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") and was in breach of the principle of data minimisation under [Article 5(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR").

Finally, the DPA held that the mayoral office has not fulfilled the requirement for providing transparent information under [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR").

However, NAIH held that issuing a reprimand under [Article 58(2)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2 "Article 58 GDPR") was sufficient, without the need for imposing a penalty under [Article 83(2)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2 "Article 83 GDPR").

In accordance with the Commission 's practice, we were informed of the public hearing by the following means and
ways:
  - publication of a call on the website of the municipality
    \[…\]

  - publication of a prospectus in the official gazette of the municipality (Annex 2)
  - placement of notices in frequented points of the district (Annex 3)

The applicant was informed in advance by e-mail by the clerk of the office
on the traceability of an event in connection with which the Applicant inquired live
opportunities to comment on the broadcast. (Annex 4)

The applicant was affected by the exercise of the right two months after the public hearing
in connection with his request, as explained in the answer to question 2,
that the minutes of the public hearing as a public representative body meeting are public, and a
publication of the minutes is mandatory under the relevant legislation. At the public hearing a
voters and members of the Board of Representatives consult directly on local public affairs,
where those present make their comments in person, taking their names and faces, the public
and you can take a picture, sound and video of the event. From my point of view

the public hearing does not fall into the category of complaints and announcements in the public interest, but
- as I have referred to several times in my present reply - is a public board meeting which I have just
the point is that voters are involved in the management of their common affairs in this particular
through a legal institution.

This and Mötv. provision is the reason for
we did not take action because we could not do so without violating the principle of publicity.
It is the intention of the legislature that the public interest requires local residents to become acquainted with the
minutes of the public board meeting.

Comparing the public and personalized information indicated above, I believe that

it can be stated that the Applicant was aware that he would apply for a public hearing.

\[…\]

Answer 4: Again, the Art. I can refer to its provision that the year
once at a mandatory public hearing, the local population is local
make questions and suggestions concerning public affairs, to comment, to ask questions,

you have a subjective right to make a proposal. The legal institution serves the purpose of serving the electorate
at this open board meeting to address questions directly to the board, a proposal
do. It follows that no submissions may be made but oral
comments, questions, suggestions. Section 93 (3) of the SZMSZ for the public hearing
“At the same time as requesting the serial number, the
the subject of the speeches. " 7

The purpose of the statement of opposition is to enable the citizen wishing to speak to
we can inform you that at the public hearing - the Mötv. provision cited several times
local public affairs, a personal problem,
an individual case may not be brought before a public hearing. So, to the topic of non-local public affairs

In case of questions belonging to the mayor, the competent office of the Mayor 's Office shall answer, or
in the absence of competence, it shall be forwarded to the competent authority as
it was also brought to the attention of the electorate on the basis of the links indicated above. Nonetheless
Applicant's first submission was not clear, it was stated during the telephone contact
administrator added. (See Annex 1 of my previous letter)

Summarizing the above, it can be concluded that public hearing is like direct democracy

one means, not submissions, but by voters in person, live
discusses issues and proposals concerning local public affairs presented by a public representative body
meeting.

\[…\]

5. Answer: Act CLXV of 2013 on Complaints and Notices of Public Interest. law

it applies to all submissions that are Section 1 (2) and (3) of this Act
shall be deemed to be a complaint or a notification in the public interest
submitted by the petitioner as such. The Internet and
It is clear from the paper-based prospectuses that the - Mötv. he called several times
In accordance with the provisions of
For this reason, the Petitioner's application does not fall within the scope of the above Act, considering that
the municipality does not call for a complaint and a public interest notification.

\[…\]

6. Answer: Paragraphs (2) - (3) of Section 93 of the SZMSZ, cited above, provide as follows:
"2. No later than 15 days before the date of the public hearing, the citizens of the district
by publication of a notice - the mayor shall notify. The announcement should be made as follows
publish:

  a) on the notice board of the mayor's office,
  (b) by publication in the district written and electronic press; and
  c) on the website of the municipality.

(3) At the public hearing, the order of speeches shall be given in sequence. The serial number
the subject of the opposition shall be indicated at the same time as the request. The serial numbers are a
can be requested in person, by telephone or from the 15th day before the day of the public hearing
electronically as set out in the notice. By 12 noon on the day of the public hearing
serial number may be requested. "

Residents can therefore request a serial number in person, by phone or by e-mail,

indicating the local public affairs of their post. On the phone and in person
the mayor's office is responsible for preparing the public hearing
will be issued to the applicant immediately by the civil servant, while in the case of comments indicated by e-mail
it shall inform the applicant shortly of the serial number and whether his post is local
whether it is a public matter. Name and contact details of the commenter (address, telephone number, e-mail address)
are included in a database only and exclusively for two reasons which are indicated by the citizen
to solve a problem.

On the one hand, if it is not raised or not fully raised during the public hearing
answer, so that we can send you an appropriate reply within the legal deadline 8

on the action taken in response to its comments, either on its own initiative or
resolved by referral to a competent authority.
On the other hand, if your argument does not fall into the category of local public affairs, then your case is
The competent office of the Mayor's Office can arrange it individually.

As the Mötv. rules of procedure, the public hearing shall normally be established
it is not realized online, but through personal participation, ensuring the voter
and elected representative direct meeting, so online public hearing data management
no prospectus has been prepared.

I find it important to note that overall it is traditional and online
public hearing data management is no different and in my opinion is in line with the current one
our data protection policy, which is available on the website of the municipality at the following link:
\[…\]

\[…\]

7. Answer: Pursuant to the provision of the SZMSZ already referred to - Section 93 (3) - the serial number
The sole purpose of the request is to ensure that the order in which the speeches are made at the public hearing (and not the
submissions!) follow the order of application to avoid on-site
any misunderstanding that may arise from the application.

\[…\]

8. Answer: Due to the epidemic situation, by filling in a form instead of a personal application,
We provided the opportunity to apply with your name, phone number and email
We requested an indication of title in order to comply with the relevant provision of the SZMSZ
which in this case is not the opposition but the problem
indicated to the citizen, on the other hand, the written answer
and to deal with non-local public affairs.

I enclose the form originally submitted by the Applicant, from which it is not clear
neither the nature nor the content of its proposal. (Annex 5)
The administrator contacted the Applicant by telephone in order to clarify the problem (which
it turned out that the indicated case did not fall into the category of local public affairs, cf. previous letter 1.
Annex).
The Applicant also sent his proposal by e-mail, in which he voluntarily provided his address by
that it was not related to the indicated problem. (Appendix 6) Not in this email

provided that he would ask for his name to be withheld, for his data to be kept confidential, although he was acting
the administrator explained in detail by telephone the legal institution of the public hearing
Mötv. and SZMSZ rules.
Subsequently, Applicant re-submitted by e-mail another, now local public case
a proposal belonging to the category (Annex 7) in which he re-entered his address, and
it still did not provide for its closed treatment.

I would also like to inform you that, in view of the epidemic situation, it is personal

received, filed by the Office, the file in accordance with the general records management rules
stored and filed. " 9

Following a review of the Code, the Authority concluded that it did not include
Indication of the task groups performed by the local government or the Office, which

personal data may or may not be processed in the course of its care, so it is lawful
effective implementation of data management requires the Data Protection Officer
contribution.

The Authority, after reviewing the rules, found that the Office nevertheless
treated as unaffected by the Applicant on 13 January 2021

official in his submission in support of the Applicant's enforcement
specifically Article 12 (3) and Article 17 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
referred to in paragraph 1 (d).

It is clear from the Applicant's replies that he treats Article 21 as a unit

the preparatory, conducting, and documenting phases of the public hearing; and the public hearing
does not differentiate between the data processing performed in the process of the Mötv.
considers it lawful under its public disclosure rules.

The Authority is involved in the complaint and its administration indicated in the opposition
in the case of data management, accepted the statement of the Applicant, in which the performance of his public duties
## Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation as the legal basis for

indicated point (e) of paragraph.

However, the personal data (name and address) of the Applicant provided by the Applicant a
by recording the public hearing in live, video or written form, and a
video recording or separately with the publication of the minutes
In the case of data processing, the Authority is of the opinion that in the present case the Applicant is personal
for the processing of data by recording and publishing their data, only the
Applicant 's appropriate, informed consent \[general data protection

## Article 6 (1) (a) of that Regulation\] could have been the appropriate legal basis

Applicant did not have.

The Authority shares the Applicant's view that the traditional (attendance)
and the data management of the online public hearing are not fundamentally different, however, the
The Authority attaches great importance and emphasizes its position that
the citizen attending the public hearing in person

exercise its right to information self-determination, ie its consent where appropriate
you can give or object to the display of your personal data in the minutes, and
with regard to their publication.

In this regard, the Authority emphasizes that the complainant is in online form
in the case of a public hearing, for a video currently available on the community portal
with regard to the disclosure of personal data
protests show that the applicant for the public hearing and the
citizens participating in the form of their speeches did not know in the online space
enforce their right to information self-determination. The online public hearing
With regard to data management, the Authority is of the firm opinion that the information

the controller needs to be more careful about the exercise of the right of self-determination
act as citizens in terms of their personal data in the online space much
are in a more vulnerable position than in the case of traditional public hearings,
as a result, it is more important and more important in relation to data management
information to the controller.

In relation to the Applicant's statement in point 8, the Authority emphasizes that the

ensuring the lawfulness of data processing at all stages of data processing
data controller, ie the obligation of the Applicant. Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
sets out the principle of accountability, according to which the controller is responsible for personal
lawful processing of personal data and must be able to demonstrate such compliance.

In view of the above, the Authority notes that during the preparation of the public hearing, the
identification of a local public matter has been lawfully made to the Applicant’s personal data

however, during the online public hearing and to the public
personal data of the Applicant in the video recording and the report made about it
the aim would have been achieved without addressing it: to present the problem raised by the Applicant,

In view of the principle of data saving under paragraph 22 (c), it would have been sufficient to

when describing.

Following that, the Authority found that its details were not regulated in the

during the publication of documents related to the operation of the local government

The Authority draws the Applicant's attention to the online public hearing
by reviewing their data management in accordance with their Regulations, or by the Applicant
with the proper handling of your request and with the involvement of the Data Protection Officer
an infringing situation could have been avoided.

Exercise of the right concerned - right of cancellation

Pursuant to Article 17 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data subject is entitled to
that, at the request of the controller, delete the personal data concerning him without undue delay
data, and the controller is obliged to provide personal data concerning the data subject

delete it without undue delay if one of the following reasons exists:
    (a) personal data are no longer required for the purpose for which they were collected
       or otherwise treated;

    (b) the data subject withdraws the information referred to in Article 6 (1) (a) or Article 9 (2);
       the consent on which the processing is based pursuant to paragraph 1 (a), and
       there is no other legal basis for data processing;
    (c) the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21 (1) and does not
       overriding legitimate reason for the processing or the data subject concerned in accordance with Article 21 (2).
       protests against data processing pursuant to paragraph
    (d) personal data have been processed unlawfully;

    (e) personal data are required by Union or Member State law applicable to the controller
       must be deleted in order to fulfill a legal obligation;
    (f) the collection of personal data referred to in Article 8 (1)
       the provision of social services.

Pursuant to Article 17 (3) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation, paragraphs 1 and 2
Paragraph 1 shall not apply where the processing is the processing of personal data
obligation under Union or Member State law applicable to the controller
public authority or a power of attorney conferred on the controller in the public interest
necessary for the performance of its task.

In the present proceedings, the Applicant approached the Applicant in the framework of the exercise of the rights concerned
in order to have his personal data disclosed in the way he has infringed
ask. To that end, he made it clear that it was about an online public hearing
in which parts of the video you can see and hear based on your personal data or the recording
where your personal data is included in the report.

He requested in his answer to Question 2 in order to clarify the facts
explained the reason for rejecting the Applicant's request to delete his personal data.

The Authority draws attention to the General Statement requested
pursuant to Article 15 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, without requesting a time limit,
is entitled at any time to receive feedback from the Applicant as data controller
whether the processing of your personal data is in progress and if such processing is taking place

pending, shall have the right to have access to personal data and data processing

access information and request the deletion of your personal data.

With regard to the data management of public board meetings, the Authority shall: a
takes the consistent view that the fact that
personal data at a public hearing, including a public hearing,
does not yet result in the data arising from this circumstance
would be made public in the public interest. The public has a duty to protect data
despite or in addition to remaining. In each case, the Authority shall emphasize the
taking into account the protection of privacy, privacy and the rights of the individual; and

full provision in public meetings and their preparation and
during the recording of the contract.
It follows from the above that data controllers must comply with the requirements of the GDPR

implement the protection of personal data. Thus, among other things, it is that personal
processing data for a specific, clear and legitimate purpose is a pre-determined purpose
for the time necessary to achieve it. Data management is also carried out in such a way - the right way
technical and organizational measures, during which it is guaranteed
adequate security of the personal data processed.

With regard to the processing of the Applicant 's personal data, the Authority considers the
He made his statement in point 1 and his last statement in point 8. According to point 1, a
the disclosure of personal data was “not for a purpose but for a public hearing
it is unique that the speakers there communicate their names and the local public affairs they raise

in order to be identifiable, their narrower living environment and, in some cases, their address
shall be marked. " However, as described in Section 8, “\[K\] it is sent by e-mail repeatedly
submitted another proposal, now in the local public affairs category, in which it reiterated
gave his address and still did not provide for its closed treatment. "

In the Authority's view, the burden of an infringement committed with inadequate data management
it may not be transferred by the Requested Data Controller to the data subject, in this case to the Applicant. The
it is the responsibility of the controller to examine it at all stages of data processing; and
considering the extent to which the personal data provided by the data subject are necessary and
are sufficient for the given data management (principle of data saving, proportionality of necessity
principle) or what is of greater interest is the narrower one raised by the Applicant
disclosure of your personal data in connection with a local public matter concerning your living environment

or, depending on the nature of the problem, that the Applicant
may become the target of insults by disclosing your personal data - the Applicant
exercise of his right to the protection of his personal data and privacy.

The statement made to the Requested Authority did not cover the fact that in the present case the Applicant
At the request of the data subject, the Applicant would have subsequently carried out a balancing test, and
He would have sought the opinion of the Data Protection Officer under the Rules.

On the basis of the above, the Authority finds that the Applicant has unlawfully denied the
Applicant for the deletion of his personal data submitted in the framework of the exercise of the data subject's rights
application.
