## English Summary

### Facts

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) launched an investigation on Orange's marketing practices after several complainants lodged a complaint with the authority.

The AEPD discovered that Orange used the provision of different services to potential clients or actual clients to obtain their phone number, that was included in different databases used for commercial and marketing purposes by the sending of SMS. Both Orange and Jazztel (Orange's subsidiary) sent daily SMS to the phones in such databases, that occasionally reached the amount of 1,050,000 SMS per day.

Orange offered two different services, one that offers information about the availability of fibre in a particular location, and one that offers direct calls for supplying information about different services, that forced the user or client to accept a privacy policy. Such privacy policy included a clause that provided consent for Orange to use the personal data of the client for commercial communications.

### Dispute

Is consent valid in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD concluded that this way of obtaining consent was not valid. The [Spanish Information Society Services Act](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2002-13758) (LSSI) implementing the e-Privacy Directive prohibits in its Article 21(1) the sending of commercial communications without express consent. The way of obtaining consent is not defined in that law, and therefore is ruled in accordance to the GDPR.

The AEPD remarks that the statement of consent shall be named as such, and that consent such be specifically given for each option of processing. Orange, however, did not offer the possibility of giving consent for each type of processing, but included consent for commercial communications in a privacy policy that was obligatory to accept for the provision of the service.

The AEPD considered that consent, under these circumstances, was not:

*   Freely given: Users were forced to accept a whole privacy policy that includes such consent.
*   Specific: They don't have an option of giving consent for each type of processing.
*   Informed: As no information about such consent for commercial communications is offered when accepting the privacy policy.

Thus, Article 21(1) LSSI has not been complied with, as there is no consent according to Articles 6 and 7 GDPR.

Serious infringements, according to the LSSI, imply a fine between €30,001 and €150,000. The AEPD decided to imposed a fine of the maximum amount, €150,000, based on the following criteria:

*   The existence of intentionality.
*   The period of time in which the infringement happened.
*   The benefits earned by it.
*   The yearly revenue of the company: €4,779,670,000 in 2019.
*   The amount of users affected and of SMS sent.
*   The fact that the company is not adhered to any kind of code of conduct or any advertisement self-regulation system.

The fine was reduced to €90,000 due to the assumption of responsibility and an early payment by Orange.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

In accordance with the investigative and corrective powers that article 58 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter
RGPD) grants each control authority, and according to the provisions of article 47 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), is competent to
resolve these investigative actions by the Director of the Spanish Agency for

Data Protection.

                                             II

Prior to the initiation of sanctioning actions, it is necessary to identify the

presumed responsible for the administrative offense.

## Article 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on Administrative Procedure

Common of Public Administrations, referring to the Initiation Agreement in the
procedures of a sanctioning nature, establishes the following:

        "1. The initiation agreement will be communicated to the instructor of the procedure, with
transfer of how many actions exist in this regard, and the interested parties will be notified,
understanding in any case the accused as such. Likewise, the initiation will be communicated
to the complainant when the rules governing the procedure so provide.

        2. The initiation agreement must contain at least:
        a) Identification of the person or persons allegedly responsible.
        ... "

In order to be able to initiate sanctioning actions, the Agency has been requested
State Tax Administration if there was any NIF associated with the entity
claimed, for identification.

The State Tax Administration Agency has responded to the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection that has not been able to locate any NIF related to the

claimed entity.
Therefore, although the claim presented, if detrimental to the possible prescription
of the infringements claimed, could constitute an infringement of the regulations of

data protection, it is not possible to initiate sanctioning actions due to not having
Tax identification of the alleged person responsible.

Therefore, in accordance with the provisions, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, IT IS AGREED:

FIRST: PROCEED WITH THE FILING of these actions.
