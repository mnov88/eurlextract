## English Summary

### Facts

On 31 March 2005, a data subject bought a house through a mortgage loan granted by Banco Santander (the controller). This mortgage loan was guaranteed by two liens: a lien on the purchased house, and a lien on another house owned by a company, Gardeblock S.L. Given this dynamic, if the data subject were to default on the mortgage loan, Gardeblock would be entitled to such information.

On 27 June 2011, Gardeblock sold the house which partially guaranteed the data subject's mortgage. On 5 October 2021, it issued a request to the data subject asking them to pay the mortgage loan back and attached a certificate it had obtained from the controller, which contained an amortisation table of the data subject's mortgage loan with the bank.

However, the data subject's completed payment was not due until 2040 and Gardeblock sold the house voluntarily, not due to a default on the loan. The data subject thus filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) arguing that the controller had improperly facilitated his banking data to a third party.

The controller apologized to the data subject, noting that the mistaken sharing of the bank certificate resulted from an employee's error. It claimed that it had already adopted security measures in order to avoid these kinds of incidents.

### Holding

The AEPD found that the controller infringed [Articles 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and [32(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1 "Article 32 GDPR"), and issued a fine of €20,000.

First of all, the AEPD found that the controller provided the certificate to the company, a third party, even though no money was owed to it by the data subject at the moment. The AEPD held that this transfer of data was excessive and should not have occurred. Therefore, it found a violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and issued a fine of €50,000.

Moreover, the AEPD noted that the controller failed to implement appropriate security measures. This led to a security incident since the controller, in its communication to the third party, attached additional information that the third party did not need to know. The AEPD did not uphold the controller’s argument regarding human error. It ruled that it is not enough to just have appropriate measures, but it is also necessary to appropriately enforce them. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of [Article 32(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1 "Article 32 GDPR").

39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the

as stated in the acknowledgment of receipt in the file.

       The person complained about in writing dated 03/14/2023 stated:

       That at the time a loan was granted to the claimant, guaranteed with
a mortgage on the home that was the object of acquisition and that was

housing was also guaranteed by a property that was owned by the company

late payment interest and costs, and proceeded to release the mortgage liability
pending on the home of Gardeblock, S.L., through payment to me

movements after the amortization of the loan by the aforementioned company.

cancellation of the mortgage of the Gardeblock company, two types of documents
different: one, which is identified as a Payment Schedule and another, as a Payment Schedule.

security and the review of the actions taken and the facts show that
the office employee who finally delivers the list of start and end amortizations

concluded the consultation process with the Department that was supposed to advise him,
human error occurring in the interpretation of the instructions received; that
The delivery of the certificate occurs due to a defective understanding by the
employee, even when advised, and this for the
fact that it is not a simple operation, but rather complex due to the presence in the
loan contract of a non-debtor mortgagee who is a party to the contract, an error that

It is understood that it may occur within the framework of legal relationships in this type of
contract; that we are faced with an excusable error and not a lack of diligence.

SIXTH: On 07/07/2023, the procedure instructor agreed to open
a period of test practice, agreeing to the following:

second, by voluntary payment before the resolution of the
procedure, reduced to 42,000 euros.

       In writing dated 05/03/2024, the instructor of the procedure informed the
claimed party that the recognition of responsibility had to be expressed

Resolution, making the corresponding deposit.

       On 05/14/2024, the claimed party presented a written statement of allegations in
response to the instructor of the procedure stating in a single allegation that not even in the
article 85 of the LPACAP, nor in any other precept is there justification for the

limitation that is intended to be applied under section 1 of the aforementioned article, which
ruling of the TS of 06/10/2022 already indicates that article 85 effectively establishes and
distinguishes two ways of finishing the procedure, however these ways are not
distinguished by the existence of unknown time frames for their exercise
but for its subsequent effects and, finally, that the diction of article 85.3 LPACAP
supports the interpretation postulated by the claimed party.

       Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The

Procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed

                                    Previous Question

       The claimed party, notified of the Proposed Resolution dated
04/08/2024, in writing dated 04/22/2024 stated: “That, in accordance with what
provided for in the aforementioned Agreement, my client has chosen to proceed, within the

period granted, to the voluntary payment of sanctions in response to the reductions
provided for in article 85 of the LPACAP, with waiver if accepted
any appeal through administrative channels, recognizing their responsibility in relation
with the facts that have given rise to this procedure.

       That as proven by the transfer receipt, which is attached, my

represented has made the payment of the penalty, with the double reduction provided for in
that precept, in attention, first, to the recognition of responsibility and,
second, which proceeds by payment voluntarily before the resolution is issued
of the procedure as long as at the same time a sanction has not been imposed
pecuniary, as a consequence of which, the penalty has been reduced to 42,000
euros”.

       On 05/03/2024, the instructor of the procedure informed the party
claimed that the double reduction was not possible since the recognition of the
responsibility had to be manifested at the beginning of the procedure, during the period for

in article 85.1 of Law 39/2015, so that the planned reduction of the
20% of the penalty, differentiating from the reduction for voluntary payment of the penalty,
which could apply when said payment occurs at any time prior to
the resolution and they were granted a period of three days in order to express whether they
accepted or not the only reduction to which they were entitled, indicated in the Proposal of
resolution.

       The claimed party has argued that neither in article 85 of the LPACAP, nor in
There is no other precept justification for the limitation that is intended to be applied to the
protection of what is stated in article 85.1 of the LPACAP, agreeing that
such acknowledgment of responsibility must be made “initiated” by the procedure,
because it expressly says so in the aforementioned precept, but what it does not say

precept is that such recognition must be made only “at the beginning” of the procedure,
reason why this entity cannot accept such an interpretation that it considers

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/24

restrictive of his rights and, he goes to strengthen his argument to the ruling of the TS
1260/2022, October 6, 2022.

       It should be noted that the Proposed Resolution issued on 04/04/2024,
In its operative part it stated that:

       “That by the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
sanction BANCO SANTANDER, S.A., with NIF A39000013,

       - For the violation of article 5.1.f), typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned
       GDPR, a fine of €50,000 (fifty thousand euros), and
       - For the violation of article 32.1 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.4.a)
       of the aforementioned RGPD, a fine of €20,000 (twenty thousand euros).

       Likewise, in accordance with the provisions of article 85.2 of the LPACAP,
You are informed that you may, at any time prior to the resolution of this
procedure, carry out the voluntary payment of the proposed sanction, which
It will mean a reduction of 20% of the total amount. With the application of
this reduction, the penalty would be established at €56,000 (fifty-six thousand
euros) and its payment will imply the termination of the procedure, without prejudice to the

imposition of the corresponding measures. The effectiveness of this reduction will be
conditioned upon the withdrawal or waiver of any action or appeal pending.
administrative against the sanction.”

       On the other hand, article 85, Termination of sanctioning procedures,

of the LPACAP establishes that:

       "1. A sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender recognizes his
responsibility, the procedure may be resolved with the imposition of the sanction
that proceeds.

       2. When the sanction is solely pecuniary in nature or fits

Any time prior to the resolution, will imply the termination of the procedure,
except in relation to the restoration of the altered situation or the determination of the
compensation for damages caused by the commission of the infringement.

       3. In both cases, when the sanction has only a pecuniary nature,
The body competent to resolve the procedure will apply reductions of, at
least, 20% of the amount of the proposed sanction, these being cumulative

initiation, the procedure must be declared initiated, during the period to formulate
allegations at the opening of the procedure. This is in accordance with the provisions of
the aforementioned article 85 of Law 39/2015, according to which the recognition of the
responsibility must occur “once the procedure has been initiated” for the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/24

planned reduction of 20% on the penalty, unlike what is established
expressly in relation to the discount for voluntary payment of the penalty, which
may be applied when said payment occurs at any time prior to the
resolution. If the aforementioned precept has distinguished the conditions in the two modes of
voluntary termination of the indicated procedure, no interpretation should

equalize these conditions as if there were no differences in their regulation.

       Article 85.2 of the LPACAP refers expressly and solely to the payment
voluntary, and not to the recognition of responsibility, determining that said payment
may occur at any time prior to the resolution. Thus, it does not fit
distinguish or oblige where the Law does not distinguish or oblige. Furthermore, the

Article 85.3 indicates that “In both cases, when the sanction has only
pecuniary nature, the body competent to resolve the procedure will apply
reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the proposed penalty, being
these can be accumulated with each other. The aforementioned reductions must be determined in
the notification of initiation of the

procedure and its effectiveness will be conditioned on the withdrawal or resignation of
any administrative action or appeal against the sanction”, which means that
both must be in the initiation agreement (referral of article 85.1 to 64 of the
LPACAP), so it does not contemplate that both reductions are in the proposal
resolution or that can be paid cumulatively at any time
prior to the resolution.

       This is also understood by the National Court, Contentious Chamber.
administrative, Section 1, which in its Judgment of 02/05/2021, Rec. 41/2019, indicates
that voluntary payment can occur at any time prior to the
resolution, while the reduction due to recognition of responsibility is
linked to the initiation agreement and the provision of article 64.2.d) of Law 39/2015: “In

regarding the violation of the provisions of articles 64 and 85 of Law 39/2015, which
contemplate the possibility of recognizing responsibility at the time of
notification of the resolution to initiate the procedure (art. 64.2.d) and take advantage of the
reductions provided for in article 85, in the agreement to initiate the procedure there are
an express reference to those articles, indicating that the
sections 2 and 3 of article 85; Furthermore, at no time has the plaintiff

shown their willingness to recognize responsibility for the sanctioned infraction and
take advantage of the possibility established in said articles (voluntary payment can
be made at any time prior to the resolution), so it is appropriate to reject
also this allegation.”

       Finally, in relation to STS 1260/2022, of 10/06/2022, although

related to what is being elucidated in this sanctioning procedure,
the issue submitted for debate in the Fifth Section of the Contentious Chamber-
administrative process of the TS was a completely different matter: determining whether
the expiration of the procedure had actually occurred because the
deadline established for its processing, and linked to the above, if it should be understood

that the procedure had ended with the advance payment, with the reduction of the
20%, who had accepted the sanction, without the need for a subsequent resolution
express, or if, on the contrary, the termination of the procedure does not occur unless
when the express act is issued putting an end to it, that is, with the agreement of the
Council of Ministers that is the object of challenge in this process.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

       For greater completeness, the First Foundation, Object of the appeal, is indicated
that: “(…) The proposed resolution includes the facts and qualifications already presented

above, even when the amount of liability caused to the
public domain, being notified to the interested party on April 19, 2021. The
The following day, May 14, he presents the sanctioned document in which he accepts the facts
accused, taking advantage of the power of voluntary payment of the proposed sanction, with
the reduction of 20 percent, being given a payment letter by the Organization of
Cuenca, which was attended by the sanctioned one (the emphasis is from the AEPD).

       (…)”.

       Therefore, not accepting the allegations made by the claimed party in
your letter of 05/14/12024, that the reductions requested be admitted with
after the issuance of the Proposed Resolution, it cannot be considered that

the interested party has legally taken advantage of neither of the two reductions provided
in the aforementioned article 85, with which you must enter the total amount of the fines
corresponding to the infractions committed, without any reduction, in accordance
with what is stated in the operative part of this Resolution.

                                           III
       First unfulfilled obligation: violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD

       The claimed facts materialize in access to the party's data
claimant, as a consequence of the information transmitted to a third party by the

claimed in relation to a mortgage loan taken out by the complaining party, which
which could lead to the violation of data protection regulations
of a personal nature.

## Article 5 of the GDPR, Principles relating to processing, states that:

       "1. The personal data will be:

       (…)”
       f) treated in such a way as to ensure adequate safety of the
       personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or

       unlawful and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application
       of appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and
       confidentiality»).
       (…)”

       Likewise, in Considering 39 it is stated that “All measures must be taken
reasonable measures to ensure that data is rectified or deleted
personal information that is inaccurate. Personal data must be processed in a way that
ensures adequate security and confidentiality of personal data,
including to prevent unauthorized access or use of such data and the equipment

used in treatment.

       The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the
claimed has violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles relating to processing, in

regarding the principle of data confidentiality contained in section 1, letter
f), when communicated to a third party, non-debtor mortgagee, list containing the
amortization table of loan with mortgage guarantee signed by the party

claimant, violating the duty of confidentiality and integrity of the data.

       This duty must be understood to have the purpose of preventing
data leaks not consented to by the data owners and comes
regulated in the aforementioned article with reference to the principle of integrity and
Confidentiality as one of the principles of data protection:

       In the response offered to the request for information made by the
AEPD, on 03/13/2023, ratified in the document of allegations to the agreement of
At the beginning, the defendant stated: “On October 5, 2021, the complaining party
receives a legal demand from the aforementioned company, demanding payment of the amount that

had paid, even though the sale was voluntary and the debt did not mature until the year
2040. Among the documentation that accompanied the claim, there was a certificate
bank issued by the claimed party, on June 25, 2021, which contained
a list with the amortization table of the loan with mortgage guarantee

signed by the complaining party, which covered from June 21, 2011 until
termination of the loan, that is, the entire period after the release of the
responsibility of Gardeblock, S.L.”

       And in writing dated 06/21/2023 it stated that “a delivery has occurred

inadequate data by the person in charge of delivering the certificate that originates
these actions due to their defective understanding of the advice received
in relation to a complex contractual relationship” (the underlinings correspond to the
AEPD).

       Likewise, in the Report prepared as a result of the incident it is indicated that “…
from the moment the Bank releases from liability the property owned by
Gardeblock, it should be considered excessive to provide information regarding the contract and
"its movements since that date, as they have occurred."

       The duty of confidentiality is an obligation that falls not only on the

responsible and in charge of the treatment but to anyone who intervenes in any
treatment phase and complementary to the duty of professional secrecy.

       Therefore, the action carried out by the defendant allowing access to
the banking information of the complaining party by a third party constitutes the violation

of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, an infringement classified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned
GDPR.

                 Classification of the violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD

       The infraction attributed to the person complained of is classified in the
article 83.5 a) of the GDPR, which considers that the violation of “the basic principles
for processing, including the conditions for consent under the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned
article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of €20,000,000 as
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as

maximum of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount.”

       The LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infractions, states that: “They constitute
infractions the acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the
article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the

present organic law.”

       And in its article 72, it considers for the purposes of prescription, which are: “Infringements
considered very serious:

       1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that

in particular, the following:

       or indirectly, through infringement.”

       In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its
Article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes that:

       "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 may also be taken into account:

       a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

       interested."

       - In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from
the instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction to be imposed

nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question; the
The facts revealed affect a basic principle regarding the treatment of

personal data, such as their confidentiality, which the
norm sanctions with the greatest severity by enabling with its actions access to a
third party that was not legitimized with the damages that this may entail since the
banking information provided was used by the aforementioned company (the third party),
attaching them to the judicial complaint against the claiming party, demanding payment of the
amount that had been paid (article 83.2, a) of the RGPD).

       The activity of the allegedly infringing entity is linked to the
processing of data of both clients and third parties. In the activity of the entity
claimed, it is essential to process the personal data of your
customers so, given its business volume, the significance of the

conduct that is the subject of this claim is undeniable (article 76.2.b) of the
LOPDGDD in relation to article 83.2.k).

Third, it constitutes an illegal act for which he was not entitled. Also connected with

the degree of diligence that the data controller is obliged to display in
compliance with the obligations imposed by data protection regulations
the SAN of 10/17/2007 can be cited. Although it was issued before the validity of the
RGPD, its pronouncement can be perfectly extrapolated to the case we are analyzing.
The ruling, after alluding to the fact that the entities in which the development of their

activity entails continuous processing of customer data and third parties must
observe an adequate level of diligence, specified that “(...). the Supreme Court
It is understood that imprudence exists whenever a legal duty is neglected

When assessing the degree of diligence, special consideration must be given to

professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case now examined,
when the appellant's activity is constant and abundant handling of data
personal character, rigor and exquisite care must be insisted on in conforming to the
legal preventions in this regard” (article 83.2, b) of the RGPD).

       The business volume of the defendant since it is one of the entities

leading financial institutions within the Spanish market, due to their business purpose (article
83.2, k) of the GDPR).

       In accordance with the foregoing, it is considered appropriate to establish a sanction of
50,000 euros for violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD.

## Article 32 of the GDPR “Security of processing” establishes that:

nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms

physical, the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which, if applicable, includes, among others:

       a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

       b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
       personnel quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the

       treatment.

       2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to
take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data

personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data.

       3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved pursuant to article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the

present article.

       4. The controller and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to
ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or
manager and has access to personal data can only process said data
following instructions from the person responsible, unless obliged to do so by virtue of the

Law of the Union or of the Member States”.

       The GDPR defines personal data security breaches as
“all those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or
accidental or illicit alteration of personal data transmitted, preserved or processed
otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.”

       The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the
claimed has violated article 32.1 of the RGPD, when an incident of
security, motivated by the absence of diligence in compliance with the measures
implemented of a technical and organizational nature.

       It should be noted that the RGPD in the aforementioned provision does not establish a list of
the security measures that are applicable in accordance with the data that are
object of treatment, but establishes that the person responsible and the person in charge of the
treatment will apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk
that the treatment entails, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of

application, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, the risks of
probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

       Likewise, security measures must be adequate and
proportionate to the risk detected, pointing out that the determination of the measures

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/24

technical and organizational measures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and
encryption, the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
resilience, the ability to restore availability and access to data after a

incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the
effectiveness of the measures.

       In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the security level, the

       In this same sense, recital 83 of the GDPR states that:

       “(83) In order to maintain security and prevent the treatment from infringing the
provided in this Regulation, the person responsible or the person in charge must evaluate
the risks inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as

physical, material or immaterial.”

       - In the case analyzed, as stated in the facts and within the framework of the
investigation file, the AEPD transferred the claim presented to the defendant

for analysis requesting the contribution of information related to the incident
claimed, confirming in your response the transfer of the bank certificate to the third party
applicant thereof, non-debtor mortgagee.

       In this way, the claimed party indicated that “In relation to this, received
the claim of the interested parties, after reviewing the reported facts, the

response confirming that, unfortunately, the branch has attached by mistake
additional information on movements after amortization finally
carried out by said company, conveying our most sincere apologies, as
as a result of the response of the Privacy Office that the complainants join their
claim".

       He has also stated that “it is evident that the Bank has carried out the
actions necessary to fulfill the obligation to implement appropriate measures
to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the treatment, although in
In this specific case, an unintended result could not have been avoided for reasons

alien to the process”

       It should be noted that the responsibility of the defendant is determined by
not having adopted the appropriate care and agility to avoid errors such as

indicated, since he is responsible for making decisions aimed at implementing and
effectively adapt appropriate organizational measures in order to guarantee
a level of security appropriate to the risk to ensure the confidentiality of the

data, restoring its availability and preventing access to it in case of
physical or technical incident.

       In the email dated 11/09/2021 sent to Communications
Judicial Adm states that:

       “(…)
       With all this, internal legal advice was asked to tell us what to do.
and the response was that we requested more documentation from the popular historian since we did not
We had enough information.
       Everything was requested and we got a discrepancy in the amount they said

have been amortized and the one that appeared in popular historical records. We consulted again with
legal advice and told us to certify with the amount that would cost us
us, providing us with the certificate model and the documentation that we had to
contribute to them, which was the amortization table from that date.
       I attach all legal advice queries, as well as all the
documentation we have obtained.

       (…)”.

       What is not consistent with what was indicated by the party claimed in the Report
about the incident produced when it indicates that: “(…) This process is
implanted and its normal operation is confirmed, verifying that it is used by the

offices appropriately (in the incident we are analyzing the employee has
observed the existing procedure), so that it is possible to conclude the existence in
Banco Santander of a diligent and risk-appropriate measure that guarantees that in
The issuance of this type of certificates does not result in accidental or fortuitous access
of personal data to the wrong recipient, so in this incident

has produced a regrettable human error, conceptual and specific, in the interpretation
of the instructions received and, specifically, about who were the owners of the
mortgage loan.

       However, from the aforementioned communication it appears that when in doubt or
discrepancy expressed by not squaring the amortized amount with the amount of the

checks received, the acting branch again requested advice from
AJN department and they were told the certificate they had to issue, facilitating the
model of the same and the documentation that had to be attached with it: the
amortization table from that date (the underlinings are from the AEPD).

       It is true that the certificate delivered did not affect its content from the
initial of the amortization schedule, from the beginning of the loan until the moment of
the amortization by the company Gardeblock, S.L. to whom the certificate was delivered
complete, was therefore entitled to have it and receive it until that date, but not
of course, from that date, receive information on the amortization schedule

after the moment in which the company had made the payment, releasing its
mortgage liability estate.

       The measures established must be necessary to prevent this type of
incidents can occur and rigorously adjust to the procedures that
are implemented by the entity to avoid them since it is ultimately about preserving

the confidentiality of data in the actions and operations of its clients.

       The claimed party must have a protocol, procedure, etc., which at the same time
implemented can guarantee security in the processing of information and
the data and prevent improper access to it, a situation
which in the present case has not occurred since the measures adopted have not

guaranteed that in the issuance of the certificate there has been no access to the
personal data by an improper recipient, the third party, providing information
improper.

       Therefore, the taking of measures must include the impact that the

rights and freedoms could have an incident, it occurs accidentally,
human, natural or technological and aimed at both reducing the impact and
probability of the same, which must be constantly renewed and improved.

       - The defendant also alleges that the ruling of the T.S. from 02/15/2022
clearly establishes that the obligation to adopt technical and organizational measures

aimed at guaranteeing confidentiality is an obligation of means and not of
results.

       The defendant acknowledges that in his actions the existence of the incident of
security when additional information on subsequent movements is mistakenly attached

to the amortization finally carried out by the company - third in contention -.

       It is true that the T.S. In its ruling it states that: “The obligation to adopt the
measures necessary to ensure the security of personal data cannot
be considered an obligation of result, which implies that a leak of

personal data to a third party there is liability regardless of the
measures adopted and the activity carried out by the person responsible for the file or the
treatment.

       In result obligations there is a commitment consisting of the
fulfillment of a certain objective, ensuring the proposed achievement or result,

In this case, guarantee the security of personal data and the absence of
security leaks or breaches.

       In the obligations of means the commitment that is acquired is to adopt
the technical and organizational means, as well as deploying diligent activity in its

implementation and use that tends to achieve the expected result with means
that can reasonably be classified as suitable and sufficient for its achievement,
For this reason, they are called "diligence" or "behavioral" obligations.

       The difference lies in the responsibility in both cases, because while

that in the obligation of result one responds to a harmful result due to the failure of the
security system, whatever its cause and the diligence used. In the
obligation of means, it is enough to establish technically adequate measures and
implement and use them with reasonable diligence.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/24

       In the latter, the sufficiency of the security measures that the
responsible must establish must be put in relation to the state of technology

at any given time and the level of protection required in relation to the data
treated, but a result is not guaranteed.”

       But it is also true that the Court confirms that the design is not sufficient
of the necessary technical and organizational means, since it is also
Its correct implementation and use in an appropriate manner is necessary, which would

We must add diligent action that has not occurred in the present case.

       Therefore, in accordance with the foregoing, it is estimated that the defendant
would be responsible for the violation of article 32.1 of the RGPD, an offense classified in
its article 83.4.a).

       For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, qualifies
of “Infringements considered serious”:

       In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction to be imposed in
the present case for the violation of article 32.1 of the RGPD, typified in article
83.4.a) of the RGPD for which the defendant is held responsible, in an initial assessment,

The following factors are considered concurrent, as aggravating circumstances:

       The nature and severity of the violation; the facts revealed
affect a basic principle regarding the processing of personal data,
such as their safety, the violation of which the norm punishes
serious way; On the other hand, the management and purpose of the treatment is questioned

carried out by allowing access to the claimant's data, data of type
economic, as a consequence of the communication to a third party of information
relating to the mortgage loan signed by the claimant with the entity and that in
In no case should it have been transmitted due to the damages it could cause, such as
consequence of said delivery and made manifest by the claiming party upon being

used by the third party, contributing them to a legal claim against the claiming party
(article 83.2, a) of the RGPD).

       The activity of the allegedly infringing entity is linked to the
processing of data of both clients and third parties. In the activity of the entity

claimed, it is essential to process the personal data of your
customers so, given its business volume, the significance of the
conduct that is the subject of this claim is undeniable (article 76.2.b) of the
LOPDGDD in relation to article 83.2.k).

       The intention or negligence in the infringement; there is a serious lack of

diligence in the actions of the defendant since the transfer of the information to a
third constitutes an illegal act for which he was not entitled, violating the measures
organizational. Also connected with the degree of diligence that the person responsible for the
treatment is obliged to deploy in compliance with the obligations that
imposes data protection regulations, the SAN of 10/17/2007 can be cited. Yeah

well it was dictated before the validity of the RGPD, its pronouncement is perfectly
extrapolated to the case we analyze. The sentence, after alluding to the fact that the
entities in which the development of their activity entails continuous processing of
customer and third party data must observe an adequate level of diligence,
specified that “(...). The Supreme Court has been understanding that there is imprudence

whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is, when the offender fails
behaves with the required diligence. And in assessing the degree of diligence it must

abundant handling of personal data, emphasis must be placed on rigor and
exquisite care to comply with the legal provisions in this regard” (article 83.2,
b) of the GDPR).

       The business volume of the defendant since it is one of the entities

leading financial institutions within the Spanish market, due to their business purpose (article
83.2, k) of the GDPR).

       In accordance with the foregoing, it is considered appropriate to establish a sanction of
20,000 euros for violation of article 32.1 of the RGPD.

                                          x
       The corrective powers that the RGPD attributes to the AEPD as a control authority
control are listed in article 58.2, sections a) to j).

       Upon confirmation of the infractions committed, it is appropriate to agree to impose on the

responsible for adopting appropriate measures to adjust its actions to the
regulations mentioned in this act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article
58.2 d) of the RGPD, according to which each supervisory authority may “order the
responsible or in charge of the treatment that the treatment operations are

certain manner and within a specified period….” The imposition of this

measure is compatible with the sanction consisting of an administrative fine, as established
provided in art. 83.2 of the GDPR.

       Therefore, it would be considered appropriate to order that the defendant within the period of
six months from the finality of the sanctioning resolution which, in any case, will be

and must decide, based on proactive responsibility and a risk approach, how

updated the incident log with details relating to the violation of the
data security; However, in the present case it is pointed out, among others, as
measures to adopt to improve those already implemented to avoid incidents such as
produced that guarantee that in the issuance of this type of certificates no
cause access to personal data by third parties or improper recipients.

graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,
