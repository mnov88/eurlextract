## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by the City Council of Vigo stating that the defendant has installed a video surveillance system pointing to the public road, without any kind of information poster; such complaint included pictures by the local police proving that the video surveillance system was installed.

### Dispute

The defendant did not answer to any AEPD investigation requests, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure. During its investigations, the AEPD discovered that (i) there is no information poster at the premises nor information clauses on such processing activity, that (ii) there is a total of two cameras in the premises of the defendant, located outdoors and pointing to the public road from which they obtain images from the pedestrians.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the video surveillance system has infringed the data minimisation principle and did not offer transparent information, so after considering some circumstances \[(i) the surveillance system is recording to the public road without cause and without information poster, (ii) there is intentionality, (iii) the defendant is a small business and has not been fined in the past for similar facts\], it decided to impose a fine of 3,000 € to the defendant. The AEPD also requires the defendant to install the corresponding information poster and information forms inside the business.
