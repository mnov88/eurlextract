DATA PROTECTION ACT 2018 AND UK GENERAL DATA
                       PROTECTION REGULATION

                                REPRIMAND

The Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) issues a reprimand to
Norfolk County Council (the Council) in accordance with Article 58(2)(b)

of the UK General Data Protection Regulation in respect of certain
infringements of the UK GDPR.

The reprimand

The Commissioner has decided to issue a reprimand to the Council in
respect of the following infringements of the UK GDPR:

   •  Article 12 (3) which states ‘the controller shall provide information

      on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data
      subject without undue delay and in any event within one month of

      receipt of the request. That period may be extended by two further
      months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and
      number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data subject

      of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request,
      together with the reasons for the delay. Where the data subject

      makes the request by electronic form means, the information shall
      be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise
      requested by the data subject’.

   •  Article 15 (1) which states ‘the data subject shall have the right to
      obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not

      personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and,
      where that is the case, access to the personal data’.
   •  Article 15 (3) which states ‘the controller shall provide a copy of the

      personal data undergoing processing’.

The reasons for the Commissioner’s findings are set out below.

Based on the findings of the investigation, the Council has only responded
to 260 out of 511 SARs within the statutory period of one or three months

during the period of 6 April 2021 to 6 April 2022. This could have had a
significant impact on the data subjects affected and we expect the Council
to take steps to improve its compliance in this area.

Mitigating factors

                                      1In the course of our investigation we have noted that the Covid – 19
pandemic has impacted the Council’s ability to access manual records due

to the lack of access to buildings which contributed to the backlog as staff
couldn’t access physical records when they formed part of a request.

Remedial steps taken by the Council

The Commissioner has also considered and welcomes the remedial steps
taken by the Council in the light of this incident. In particular it has taken
steps to increase its staff working on SARs and consolidated them into a

single, dedicated team which is solely focussed on SAR responses and
closing the backlog.

Decision to issue a reprimand

Taking into account all the circumstances of this case, including the
mitigating factors and remedial steps, the Commissioner has decided to

issue a reprimand to the Council in relation to the infringements of Article
12 (3), Article 15 (1) and Article 15 (3) of the UK GDPR set out above.

Further Action Recommended

The Commissioner recommends that the Council should take certain steps
to ensure its compliance with UK GDPR. With particular reference to

Articles 12(3) and 15 (1) and (3) of the UK GDPR, the following steps are
recommended:

   1. The Council should take steps to ensure that SARs are responded to

      within statutory deadlines.
   2. The Council should ensure it has adequate staff resources in place
      to process and respond to SARs. The ICO notes that the Council has
      taken steps to ensure it has adequate staffing levels to manage its

      SAR intake; however it considers the Council should continue to
      review and monitor this.
   3. The Council should ensure it continues to implement effective

      measures to address its backlog.

The Commissioner requires the Council to provide details of the actions
taken to address the above recommendations within six months of receipt

of this reprimand, and by no later than Monday 6 November 2023.
