                                            SAW

During the processing of this procedure, the defendant entity has answered
to this Agency, but it does not certify having fulfilled what was requested by the complaining party
addressing the rights or denying reasonedly and, remitting the mandatory
response to your request.

Thus, it is not possible to accept that the answer that corresponds to give can be manifested with

occasion of a mere administrative procedure, such as the formulation of allegations with
reason for this proceeding, initiated precisely for not duly addressing
the application in question.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/7

The aforementioned rules do not allow the request to be ignored as if it were not
would have raised, leaving her without the answer that must be issued by the

responsible, even in the event that there is no data in the files or even in
those cases in which it does not meet the established requirements, in which case the
recipient of said request is also obliged to request the correction of
the deficiencies observed or, where appropriate, deny the request with reasoned
indicating the causes for which it is not appropriate to consider the right in question.

Therefore, the request that is formulated obliges the person in charge to give an express response in
in any case, using any means that justifies the receipt of the
reply.

Given that a copy of the necessary communication that must be addressed to the

complaining party informing him about the decision he has adopted regarding the
request to exercise rights, it is appropriate to estimate the claim that originated the
present procedure.

Given the aforementioned precepts and others of general application, the Director of the Agency
