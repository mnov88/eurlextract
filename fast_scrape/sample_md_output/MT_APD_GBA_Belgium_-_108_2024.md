## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject received an unsolicited commercial e-mail from a company (data controller). It contained an invitation to create an account on the new online ticketing platform (football club) in order to purchase subscriptions and tickets. The data subject filed an access request under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") to know the source of their data. According to the data subject, they didn’t disclose their data to the controller. In response, the controller deleted the data at hand, however the controller didn’t respond to the access request.

The data subject decided to complain with the Belgian DPA (ADP/GBA). Prior to lodging the complaint with the DPA, the data subject took part in an unsuccessful mediation proceedings.

During the examination proceedings, the DPA found the data subject’s data came from the database of a bankrupt soccer club, possessed by one of the controller’s business partners. The business partner transferred the data to the controller. Allegedly, the controller planned to restart the bankrupt club. Moreover, the controller’s privacy policy was lacking of clear information on data transfers to or from third parties. Additionally, the DPA identified other violations of the GDPR, in particular regarding the cookies transparency and the cookies setup.

In a written statement, the controller explained the data of the bankrupt club were transferred within the bankruptcy proceedings. Although the data subject received the e-mail from the controller, the “unsubscribe” button limited a potential harm of the data subject to mere reception of unsolicited commercial e-mail. The controller called the legitimate interest under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") to be a legal basis for sending the e-mails of that kind. Furthermore, the controller updated the privacy policy in line with recommendations of the DPA, addressing the shortcomings mentioned during the control.

### Holding

The DPA upheld the complaint.

First, the DPA emphasised there was no clear legal basis for the data transfer from the controller’s business partner to the controller. Doubtless, the initial purpose of data processing was incompatible with the transfer to and subsequent data processing by the controller. Nevertheless, for the DPA the transfer of assets, including the database, related to the bankruptcy proceedings, fell within the scope of legitimate interest under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). Hence, the data subject’s data were transferred lawfully.

Secondly, the controller relied on [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") for direct marketing purposes and subsequent commercial mailing. The legitimate interest “test”, performed by the DPA indicated the controller was able to lawfully sent e-mail to former members of the bankrupt club (approximately 6,000 individuals), including the data subject. According to the DPA the legitimate interest pursued by the controller amounted to restarting the club, there was no alternative to effectively reach out the former members. Also, the members were aware of the club’s bankruptcy, so a takeover of the club was within their expectations.

Thirdly, the e-mail received by the data subject did not contain all information necessary under [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"). There was no information about right to object under [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"), as well no link to the privacy policy. The controller was then in breach of [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR"), [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR") and [Article 21(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#4 "Article 21 GDPR").

Fourthly, the controller didn’t respond to the data subject’s access request. The fact that the controller deleted the data was irrelevant. The data subject expected to be informed about the origin of the data, not necessarily their deletion. Hence, the data subject’s request was not handled and the controller violated [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR"), [Article 12(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR").

Consequently, for violations of [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR"), [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR"), [Article 12(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR"), [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"), Article 15(1) and [Article 21(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#4 "Article 21 GDPR") the DPA imposed a fine of €8,000.

1/31

Litigation Chamber

Decision on the merits 108/2024 of 27 August 2024

File number: DOS-2020-00072

Subject: Acquisition of a membership list in the context of a takeover by the acquiring

football club and use of the personal data obtained for commercial

mailings

The Litigation Chamber of the Data Protection Authority, composed of Mr

Hielke HIJMANS, chairman, and Mr Dirk Van Der Kelen and Mr Frank De Smet, members;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016

on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of

personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing

Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR";

Having regard to the law of 3 December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority,

hereinafter referred to as “WOG”;

Having regard to the internal rules of procedure, as approved by the Chamber of

Representatives on 20 December 2018 and published in the Belgian Official Gazette on
15 January 2019;

Having regard to the documents in the file;

Has taken the following decision regarding:

Complainant: Mr X, hereinafter referred to as “the complainant”

Defendant: Y, represented by counsel Nicolas Wesling and general manager

Mr \[…\], hereinafter referred to as “the defendant” Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 2/31

I. Facts and procedure

1. On 8 January 2020, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority

against the defendant. The complainant had previously submitted the file to the First Line Service for mediation, but the complainant claims that this mediation procedure did not produce a satisfactory result.

2. The subject of the complaint concerns the receipt of an unsolicited commercial e-mail

sent on 2 October 2018 by the defendant to the complainant. In response to this,

the complainant contacted the defendant on 3 October 2018 to ask how his

personal data were obtained without his knowledge, since he had never provided them

to the defendant himself. He therefore requested the defendant to inspect his

personal data, whereby the complainant expressly requested that he inform

him how the defendant obtained his personal data and on what legal basis

they are processed. According to the complainant, the defendant did not provide a satisfactory

answer to his request for inspection, but merely reported that his personal

data were being deleted, although the complainant had not requested this.

Furthermore, the complainant states that unwanted emails were still sent to him

despite the notification of data erasure by the defendant.

3. The complaint is part of a bankruptcy in which the trustee initially arranged a transfer of the membership file of the bankrupt football club to W BV on 8 June

2018, after which the file was subsequently transferred to the defendant on 13 June 2018. The personal data of the subscribers of the bankrupt club were already in the database of Z, a private limited company under

Dutch law, before the bankruptcy, since the bankrupt club had decided to cooperate with Z

regarding communication with the supporters. The defendant in turn decided

to continue the cooperation with Z. 4. On 10 February 2020, the complaint is declared admissible by the First Line Service on the basis of

Articles 58 and 60 WOG and the complaint is transferred to the Dispute Chamber on the basis of Article 62, § 1 WOG

. 5. On 5 March 2020, the Dispute Chamber decides on the basis of Article 63, 2° and 94, 1° WOG

to request an investigation from the Inspection Service.

6. On 6 March 2020, in accordance with Article 96, § 1 WOG, the request of the
Dispute Chamber to conduct an investigation is transferred to the Inspection Service,

together with the complaint and the inventory of the documents.

7. On 1 December 2020, the investigation by the Inspection Service will be completed, the report will be added to the file and the file will be transferred by the Inspector General

to the President of the Dispute Chamber (Article 91, § 1 and § 2 WOG). Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 3/31

The report contains findings regarding the subject of the complaint and decides,

in summary, that:

1. The Inspection Service finds that the transfer of personal data by W BV

to the defendant has not been directly and formally documented as required

by Article 5.2. GDPR and Article 26.1. GDPR.

2. Z can be considered a processor within the meaning of Article 4. 8) GDPR. However, a

processor agreement is missing, which means that Article 28.3. GDPR has

been violated. 3. The defendant has violated Article 6 GDPR due to the lack of a valid basis

for both the transfer of the personal data of the bankrupt club to the

defendant and for the mailing to the subscribers of the bankrupt club.

4. The defendant has violated the purpose limitation principle (Article 5.1 GDPR),

since the provision of personal data by the receiver to another controller,

namely the defendant, cannot take place on the basis of compatibility with the

collection purpose. The position of the Inspection Service is based on a view previously taken by the

Dutch supervisory authority (Dutch Data Protection Authority). The Inspection Service

also links this to a violation of Article 5.2. GDPR.

5. The information about transfer to third parties in the privacy policy is

unclear and not in accordance with Article 12.1. GDPR. The report of the Inspection Service states that

the privacy policy refers to both Directive 95/46/EC and the GDPR. According to the Inspection Service, this leads

to suspect that the privacy policy dates from the period

between the publication date of the GDPR on 4 May 2016 and 25 May 2018. The report

states that one hypothesis is that the privacy policy of the bankrupt company

was adopted, albeit with the contact details replaced.

6. The defendant violates the information obligation via the various privacy statements on \[…\]
that were not coordinated. Therefore, there is a violation of

Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR.

7. With regard to the websites, it is established that the three cookie statements – which

are to be distinguished from the privacy statements – were not drawn up in

accordance with the information obligation of Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR. The

consent requirement on the websites is not properly incorporated as required by

Articles 7.2. and 7.3. GDPR. The respective websites do not respect the principles

of data protection by design and default settings, thereby violating Article

25 GDPR. The principle of storage limitation (Article 5.1 e) GDPR) is

not respected because the websites store cookies for too long. Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 4/31

8. The privacy and cookie statements on the websites are not coherent and

not drawn up in accordance with Articles 5.1. a); 6; 7.3.; 12.1., 13 and 14 GDPR.

9. The complainant's right of access (Article 15 GDPR) was

violated by the defendant.

10. The method of requesting personal data on the websites does not comply with the principle of data protection by design and by default (Article 25 GDPR)

11. The information included in the register of processing activities

does not meet the requirements of Article 30.1. GDPR.

12. The duty to cooperate has been breached (Article 31 GDPR).

8. On 3 March 2021, the Dispute Resolution Chamber decides on the basis of Article 95, § 1, 1° and Article 98

WOG that the file is ready for substantive processing and the parties concerned are informed by registered mail of the provisions as stated in

Article 95, § 2, as well as those in Article 98 WOG. They are also informed on the basis of Article 99

WOG of the deadlines for submitting their defences.

The deadline for receipt of the defendant's conclusion of reply was set at 15 April 2021, that for the complainant's conclusion of reply on 6

May 2021 and that for the defendant's conclusion of reply on 27 May 2021.

On 22 March 2021, the defendant requested a copy of the file (Article 95, § 2, 3° WOG),

which was sent to him on 6 April 2021. The defendant also

electronically accepts all communication regarding the case, reports that he will submit

means of defence and indicates that he wishes to make use of the opportunity to be heard,

in accordance with Article 98 WOG.

9. On 15 April 2021, the Dispute Chamber receives the defendant's conclusion of reply. First, the defendant sets out factually and on the basis of additional documents

how he obtained the membership file of the bankrupt club, underlining

the specific circumstances, namely the data transfer

as a result of the bankruptcy with the subsequent restart, as well as the time frame, namely

the coincidence with the application of the GDPR. In particular, with regard

to the sending of e-mails to the plaintiff, the defendant states that an

"Unsubscribe" button was provided and that the possible damage to the data subject was limited to

the receipt of one unwanted e-mail. For the sending of the e-mail, the

defendant relies on his legitimate interest. The defendant argues that both the

privacy and cookie statements were adapted to the comments of the Inspection Service and that each e-mail

contains a link leading to the privacy statement. Finally,

thedefendantnotesthatneitherZnorthecuratorhaveformulatedanyreservationsDecisiononthesubstantivematter108/2024 — 5/31

onthetransferofthedataorthesendingofcommercialmessagestothepersonsincludedinthemembershipfile.

10. On 3 May 2021, the Disputes Chamber receives the conclusion of the reply from the complainant in which

he emphasises that his request to the respondent did not concern the deletion of his data,

but that he did wish to hear from the respondent how his data was obtained.

According to the complainant, the respondent has violated the GDPR because it continued to

refuse to provide clarification on this matter. The complainant states that the

uncertainty cited by the respondent regarding the application of the GDPR in the first

months after its entry into force is not an argument, since this had been

extensively communicated in advance. The complainant also responds to the defendant's claim that the complainant's intention was to cause damage to the defendant rather than to protect his interests. The complainant states that he has previously been the victim of identity fraud, which is why he pays particular attention to the protection of his personal data.

11. On 27 May 2021, the Dispute Chamber receives the defendant's conclusion of reply

which repeats the various elements as stated in the conclusion of reply

and updates them by adding documents, in order to demonstrate that work has been done in the meantime

to solve problems that emerged from the report of the Inspection Service.

12. On 22 January 2024, the parties are informed that the hearing will

take place on 20 February 2024.

13. On 20 February 2024, the parties are heard by the Dispute Chamber.

14. On 22 February 2024, the minutes of the hearing are submitted to the parties.

15. On 22 February 2024, the Disputes Chamber receives a comment from the complainant regarding the minutes, which it decides to include in its deliberations.

16. On 4 July 2024, the Disputes Chamber informed the defendant of its intention to impose an administrative fine, as well as the amount thereof, in order to give the defendant the opportunity to defend itself,

before the sanction is actually imposed.

17. On 13 August 2024, the Disputes Chamber receives the defendant's response to the

intention to impose an administrative fine, as well as the amount thereof. The defendant confirms without further ado that it accepts the proposed

fine of EUR 8,000. He merely adds that the proposed amount

1The complainant apparently refers here to the date on which the GDPR became applicable, namely 25 May 2018 (Article 99.2 GDPR), not the date of entry into force, namely 24 May 2016 (Article 99.1 GDPR) Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 6/31

is nevertheless considered disproportionately high, but nevertheless fails to provide any

reasoning for this.

II. Reasoning

a) Legal basis

• Transfer of the membership file to the trustee and then transfer to the

defendant

18. First, the Dispute Chamber examines whether the defendant lawfully

came into possession of the complainant's personal data. Originally, the

personal data of the complainant in his capacity as subscriber of V, were lawfully obtained by this club

within the framework of the membership of the complainant of that club.

This acquisition is not as such the subject of any dispute. V was

nevertheless declared bankrupt on 14 May 2018. The assets, including all data of subscribers,

including that of the complainant, have from that moment been managed by the trustee charged

with the liquidation of the bankrupt estate before being transferred to WBV on the basis of the

agreement dated 8 June 2018, immediately followed by the transfer on 13 June 2018

to the defendant. Prior to the actual transfer to the defendant of the assets, including the

membership file, the trustee thus takes over the role of controller of the bankrupt football

club. It is also established that

the trustee processes this file for a purpose that is distinct from the initial

purpose. Where the initial purpose at the time of the acquisition by the bankrupt was to record the

membership of the complainant with all the associated facilities and communication

regarding the activities of the club, the trustee has the same personal data by operation of law

since the bankruptcy for a completely different purpose, namely the realisation of the

assets falling under the estate, which in the present case also contain personal data. Since this data transfer

constitutes processing within the meaning of Article 4. 2) GDPR for a new purpose that is distinct

from the initial purpose, namely the registration of the membership of the football

club, the Dispute Resolution Chamber shall examine whether or not this new purpose

for which the membership file is processed within the context of a bankruptcy can be

considered compatible with the initial purpose as brought to the attention of the complainant

when he joined the club as a supporter.

19. In accordance with Article 5.1. b) GDPR, the processing of personal data for

purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected may only

be permitted if the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data

were initially collected. Taking into account the criteria Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 7/31

2 set out in Article 6.4. GDPR and recital 50 GDPR must therefore be examined whether

the further processing, in this case the transfer of the membership file – containing

the complainant’s data – to the trustee and subsequently to a transferee

of the assets falling into the estate (in this case the defendant), is or is not

compatible with the initial processing consisting of the registration of the membership of

football supporters. The Dispute Chamber concludes that the complainant entrusted his

personal data to the bankrupt club in order to join the club as a subscriber

and could not reasonably have expected that the same data would be used

in the context of a possible later bankruptcy

for transfer to a trustee without the complainant being able to object to this

and without the complainant being informed about this, and this regardless of the

purpose for which the trustee in turn will process the personal data obtained. The Dispute Chamber

hereby clarifies that, in assessing the reasonable expectations of the complainant, it

takes into consideration that the receiver can, within the framework of his statutory

assignment, convert the membership file thus obtained into cash for any other purpose that is

distinct from the original purpose, and his assignment is by no means limited to

effecting a restart of the club. Since the receiver is not obliged to

merely make a restart possible, but it is possible that, as soon as bankruptcy

occurs, the receiver can convert the membership file into cash for any other new purpose and

this against the will of the parties involved, the data processing on the part of the receiver in the event of bankruptcy

cannot simply be regarded as compatible further processing. 20. The determination that there is no compatible further processing leads to the conclusion that

a separate legal basis is required for the transfer of the membership file by the

curator to the defendant to be regarded as lawful.

21. After all, processing of personal data, including incompatible further

processing as in the present case, is only lawful if there is a legal basis for

doing so. For incompatible further processing, recourse should be had

to Article 6.1. GDPR and Recital 50 GDPR. Recital 50 GDPR states that a

separate legal basis is required for the processing of personal data for other

2 Recital 50 GDPR: \[…\] In order to assess whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the
purpose for which the personal data were initially collected, the controller, after having
fulfilled all requirements concerning the lawfulness of the original processing, should, inter alia,
take into account: any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended
further processing; the context in which the data were collected; in particular the
reasonable expectations of the data subjects based on their relationship with the controller
regarding the further user; the nature of the personal data; the
impact of the intended further processing on the data subjects; and appropriate safeguards in both the
original and the intended further processing. 3Recital 50GDPR: Processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected may only be permitted if the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In that case, no separate legal ground other than that on which the collection of personal data was authorised is required. \[…\] Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 8/31

purposes that are incompatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. The separate legal grounds on the basis of which a processing, including therefore incompatible further processing, may be considered lawful are laid down in Article 6.1. GDPR.

22. To this end, the Dispute Chamber examines to what extent the legal grounds as determined in Article

6.1. GDPR can be invoked by the defendant in order to justify the further processing

of the personal data relating to the complainant. The report of the Inspection Service refers to a letter that was sent by the Personal Data Authority

to the Dutch Association of Insolvency Lawyers (INSOLAD) on 6 January 2020, which states that the transfer of the

membership file by the trustee to third parties (such as the defendant) requires the prior,

informed consent of each of the members individually. However, this is not the case in the

file at hand. 23. Since there are no other elements in the file that indicate a possible other legal basis as included in Article 6.1 GDPR, the

Dispute Chamber will investigate whether the transfer of the membership file by the receiver to the

defendant can be based on Article 6.1f) GDPR, consisting of the legitimate

interest of the receiver to proceed with that transfer. After all, the Dispute Chamber is of the

opinion that, in order to ensure completeness of the analysis regarding the legal basis, all

possible legal grounds should be examined. This is not the case in the

aforementioned letter that was addressed by the Dutch Data Protection Authority to INSOLAD

in which only consent (Article 6.1 a GDPR) is put forward as the legal

basis for transfer by the receiver without examining whether legitimate interest

(Article 6.1 f) GDPR) can serve as a possible legal basis. The report of the

Inspection Service also lacks an investigation into the application of Article 6.1 f) GDPR as a

possible legal basis for the transfer of the membership file by the trustee to the

defendant, in which it is investigated whether the trustee, as the controller, can

rely on the legitimate interest for the transfer to a third party. The report of the Inspection Service does state that no explicit explanation was given by the

defendant for the processing at issue itself (the transfer of personal data from the bankrupt estate

to the defendants/or via Z) that could justify an

appeal to Article 6.1 f) GDPR, although the Inspection Service states that in

its letter of 25 March 2020 addressed to the defendant it nevertheless referred to

the Association of Insolvency Law Attorneys (INSOLAD). Through INSOLAD, the AP (Dutch Data Protection Authority) aims to inform as many insolvency lawyers and bankruptcy trustees as possible about the legal framework that applies to the processing of personal data in the estate of a bankrupt (legal) person, and the responsibility for compliance with the GDPR that rests with the trustee in that context. The letter states the following:
“When selling personal data (e.g. in the form of a customer file) (…) there is a provision to another controller. (…) Such provision of personal data must be based on the prior consent of the data subject(s) in accordance with Article 7 GDPR.” Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 9/31

the legal elements that must be demonstrated for the application of Article 6.1

f) GDPR. However, the Dispute Chamber notes that the relevant letter only

states that the defendant relies on the “legitimate interest” to demonstrate the

lawfulness of the processing(s) and that three elements (legitimate interest,

necessity of the processing, balancing of interests) must be demonstrated for this purpose.

The relevant letter from the Inspection Service only mentions “processing(s)” in general

terms, without specifying that the defendant is expected to justify the legal basis for “the

transfer of the membership file from the bankrupt estate”. This then leads the Inspection

Service to state that the legal basis for the initial transfer has not been explained or

demonstrated by the defendant. The report contains no further explanation in this regard. The

inspection report only addresses the legitimate interest of the

defendant as controller, whereby the Inspection Service limits itself to

the question of whether the defendant can use the data obtained from the bankrupt estate

for sending mailings on the basis of Article 6.1 f) GDPR. The Inspection Service

takes direct marketing as the starting point as the purpose pursued by the defendant

to assess whether Article 6.1 f) GDPR can apply. However, the Dispute Chamber

is of the opinion that it is crucial to ask the question beforehand whether the

transfer of the membership file by the trustee to the defendant took place in a lawful manner

and only then to ask the question whether the defendant could reuse the data obtained

for sending mailings. 24. In accordance with Article 6.1 f) GDPR and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the

European Union (hereinafter “the Court”), three cumulative conditions must be met

for a controller to be able to validly rely on this

ground of lawfulness, “namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate

interest of the controller or of the third party(ies) to whom the

data are disclosed, second, the necessity of processing the personal data

for the pursuit of the legitimate interest, and, third, the condition that the

fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail” (Rigas judgment).5

25. In order to be able to rely on the ground of lawfulness of

“legitimate interest” in accordance with Article 6.1 f) GDPR, the controller must, in other words,

demonstrate that:

1) the interests pursued by the processing can be recognised as legitimate (the ‘purpose test’);

5CJEU, 4 May 2017, C-13/16, Valsts policijas Rīgas reģiona pārvaldes Kārtības policijas pārvalde v Rīgas pašvaldības SIA
‘Rīgassatiksme’, paragraph 28. See alsoCJEU, 11 December 2019, C-708/18, TKt v AsociaţiadeProprietariblocM5A-ScaraA,
paragraph 40. Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 10/31

2) the intended processing is necessary for the realisation of those interests (the

‘necessity test’); and

3) the weighing of these interests against the interests, fundamental freedoms

and fundamental rights of data subjects weighs in favour of the controller (the "balancing test").

26. With regard to the first condition (the so-called "purpose test"), the Dispute Chamber of

is of the opinion that the winding up of a bankruptcy must be considered to have been carried

out with a view to a legitimate interest. It allows the trustee to fulfil his task enshrined in Book XX of the

Code of Economic Law (WER), namely to proceed with the liquidation of the bankrupt estate as

stipulated in Article XX.98 WER. This 6

statutory task means that the trustee is obliged to proceed with the sale of the assets that are still in the

estate, in order to pay the debts of the bankrupt towards its creditors. The main thing is that the curator tries to

sell at the highest possible price, which in a sense implies a commercial interest.

Such a commercial interest can be a legitimate interest in accordance with

recital 47 GDPR. This is also supported in Opinion 06/2014 of the

Data Protection Group Article 29. The first

condition contained in Article 6.1, f) GDPR is therefore met.

27. In order to meet the second condition, it must be demonstrated that the

processing is necessary for the achievement of the objectives pursued. This

means in particular that the question must be asked whether the same result can be

achieved by other means without processing personal data or without

unnecessarily intrusive processing for the data subjects.

6 Art. XX.98 WER. The bankruptcy procedure aims to place the debtor's assets under the authority of a trustee who is responsible for managing and liquidating the bankrupt's assets and distributing the proceeds among the creditors.
7 Recital 47 states that the processing of personal data for the purposes of direct marketing may be considered to be carried out for the purposes of a legitimate interest. Direct marketing is thus an example of a commercial interest that is considered a legitimate interest.

for certain types of marketing activities, both online and offline, provided that
appropriate safeguards exist (including a usable mechanism to object to such
processing in accordance with Article 14(b), as will be demonstrated in Section III.3.6 The right to object and beyond).”\[own emphasis\]

28. The Dispute Resolution Chamber takes into consideration that in the present case there is a
relaunch of the football club by the defendant, as is apparent from the factual

elements cited in the defendant’s submission. This necessarily means a sale

of the football club in its entirety to the defendant with a view to continuing the

club. In order to be able to realise this restart, it is required and therefore necessary that the

membership file is also transferred to the acquiring club, in this case the

defendant. Without the contact details of the subscribers, in the present case limited to

first name, surname and e-mail address, the subscribers cannot be reached and

any restart after bankruptcy would in fact be made impossible. This leads to the

conclusion that the second condition of Article 6.1 f) GDPR has also been

met.

29. In order to determine whether the third condition of Article 6.1, f) GDPR - the

so-called "balancing test" between the interests of the controller, on the one hand, and

the fundamental freedoms and rights of the data subject, on the other - can be

met, the reasonable expectations of the data subject must be taken into account in accordance with

recital 47 GDPR. In particular, it must be assessed

whether “the data subject, at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data,

may reasonably expect that processing for that purpose may take place”.0

30. This is also emphasised by the Court in its judgment “TK v/ Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc

M5A-ScaraA” of 11 December 2019, in which it states:

“Also relevant to this assessment are the data subject’s reasonable expectations that his

or her personal data will not be processed if, in the given circumstances of the case, the

data subject cannot reasonably expect any further processing of the data”.

31. The Litigation Chamber examines whether the defendant’s interest is proportionate to the

impact it has on the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects,

including the complainant. In this regard, the Disputes Chamber notes that it is established that the

statutory task of the trustee is to represent the interests of the

creditors. The trustee will therefore wish to achieve the highest possible proceeds by

selling the entire assets, including the entire membership base, of the

bankrupt to the restarter. After all, the membership base is to be

regarded as essential in the minds of the restarter, since having the

contact details of the subscribers forms the starting point for making a restart possible.

32. On the other hand, there is the interest of the subscribers to be able

to continue to have access to their personal data, so that they are not

transferred to a buyer –

10 Recital 47 GDPR. 1CJEU, 11 December 2019, C-708/18, TK v/ Asociaţia de Proprietaribloc M5A-ScaraA, paragraph 58. Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 12/31

in this case, the defendant – without being informed of this and without being able to object

to it. However, it should not be forgotten that it falls within the normal expectations of the complainant that in the event of bankruptcy,

the trustee will proceed to sell the assets and the associated membership file in

order to facilitate the intended restart of the club. In this case, as is apparent from

the agreement dated 13 June 2018, the trustee has transferred the membership file in its entirety

to the defendant with a view to restarting the club. This restart is a fundamental element for the

Dispute Chamber in the balancing of interests. Such a restart

is also in the interest of the subscribers in the sense that if the initial

purpose is continued unchanged by the acquiring club and as a result of which

the impact on the data protection of the subscribers must be considered minimal,

it is aimed at ensuring that the subscriber can continue to enjoy

the benefits associated with membership.

33. It should also be taken into account that the data processing

relating to membership only concerns the registration of the first name, surname and

e-mail address. The impact on the complainant is therefore extremely small and the processing

of his personal data is limited to a minimum. 34. The above elements as a whole lead the Dispute Chamber to conclude that

the third condition has also been met and the transfer of the customer file by the receiver

to the defendant can be based on the legal basis of Article 6.1 f) GDPR,

which means that this incompatible further processing must be considered lawful within the meaning of Article 6 GDPR.

In that sense, the agreement drawn up by the receiver on 13 June 2018 also states that the defendant retains all rights and

obligations with regard to the former football club that was the subject of the bankruptcy. It is thus apparent from the factual elements of the file that

with regard to the acquisition of the personal data of the subscribers, including those

of the complainant, the defendant has taken over the rights and obligations of the former

bankrupt football club, including those concerning the database concerning the subscribers,

which means that it must be established that the complainant's data were

lawfully transferred to the defendant in accordance with Article 6 GDPR.

35. The question whether the receiver has complied with the obligation under Article 12 GDPR

in conjunction with Article 14 GDPR, in order to ensure transparent data processing, in

which the data subjects are provided with the necessary information, in particular

regarding their legitimate interest (Article 14.2 b) GDPR) and are informed of their

right to object (Article 14.2 c) GDPR) is not apparent from the

documents in the file. Since this point

is not the subject of the complaint and no elements were presented that indicate that the GDPR would have been violated on this point, the Dispute Chamber will not go into

this in more detail.

• Commercial mailing by the defendant

36. For the marketing services relating to the
12 supporter data, the defendant relies on Z, who, as also confirmed in the inspection report, acts as a

processor within the meaning of Article 4.8) GDPR and has already been engaged by the bankrupt

club and with whom the defendant has continued the collaboration. The

Dispute Chamber points out that the capacity of processor on the part of Z has remained unchanged

for the entire duration of the appointment to provide communication with the

supporters, subscribers of the club. When the original club was declared bankrupt,

the receiver took over the role of controller (see above) and

subsequently W BV became the controller pursuant to the transfer effected by the

receiver that took place on 8 June 2018, after which the

processing responsibility was definitively transferred to the defendant

pursuant to the cooperation agreement concluded on 13 June 2018.

37. Based on the documents, it appears that the defendant instructed the

processorZom, in accordance with the proposal drawn up by the processor at the request of

the defendant, to send an e-mail to the members of the bankrupt football club with

an invitation to create an account on the new online ticket platform in order to

be able to purchase season tickets and tickets, as well as with the October

2018 newsletter. According to the documents, the defendant, as the controller,

both in direct communication with the complainant and in the context of the

mediation procedure by the First Line Service, relies on its legitimate interest in contacting the

subscribers included in the membership file of the bankrupt club via the mailing sent

by the processor. 38. The Dispute Chamber points out that the legitimate interest of the defendant could serve as a

13 legal basis for processing the identification data of the complainant as

recorded in the membership file for direct marketing purposes.

12 A private limited company under Dutch law
1Article 6.

1. Processing shall only be lawful if and to the extent that at least one of the following conditions is met:
a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific
purposes;

\[…\]
f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller
or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 14/31

Recital 47 GDPR 14 expressly states that the processing of

personal data for direct marketing purposes may be considered to be

carried out for the purposes of a legitimate interest (Article 6.1 f) GDPR). This means that

the controller does not have to obtain the data subject's consent (Article 6.1 a) GDPR)

prior to processing for direct marketing.

39. In order to base the mailing to former subscribers on the legal basis

of a "legitimate interest", the three-part test mentioned above must also be

passed.

40. As regards the first condition (the so-called "purpose test"), the Dispute

Chamber is of the opinion that the purpose pursued by the defendant, which consists of contacting former

subscribers once by e-mail in order to offer them a subscription to the acquiring

club in a restart, can be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of

recital 47 GDPR. Consequently, the first condition

contained in Article 6.1, f) GDPR has been met.

41. Regarding the second condition (the so-called "necessity test"), the

defendant has put forward arguments that make it plausible that the intended objective would not have been achieved on the basis of

alternatives that, according to the Inspection Service, would be less intrusive for the former

subscribers concerned than the mailing that was sent.

Where the Inspection Service refers to a media campaign and flyers, the

defendant points out that reaching all interested supporters cannot be achieved by a media campaign

(whereby the supporters who would not yet be aware of the offer would then

contact the defendant directly, which would not be feasible). Distributing flyers in the stadium is

also not an option according to the defendant, since the supporters must first be

informed about a match in order to be able to attend and then receive a flyer. In this respect, the defendant also points to the context in which

a football match takes place, where the vast majority of the supporters will in all

probability return home without a flyer and will therefore not be aware of

its content.

42. The Dispute Chamber is of the opinion that without the mailing in

question, the specific target group, which targets all former season-ticket holders, cannot be reached. The

proposed alternatives would, after all, result in some of the

supporters not being reached when flyers are distributed in the stadium or in the event of

14 Recital 47 GDPR: \[…\] The processing of personal data for the purpose of direct marketing can be

regarded as being carried out in the interests of a legitimate interest. Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 15/31

a media campaign would also be aimed at persons who do not belong to the

target group at all. The second condition must therefore be considered to be met.

43. In assessing the third condition, the so-called "weighing test", the

reasonable expectations of the former subscribers are paramount. It is established that the former subscribers,

as supporters of the former football club, were unmistakably aware of the

bankruptcy in which the club found itself, with the inherent possibility

that the club would be taken over.

44. The Dispute Chamber decides that the defendant is right to rely on the legal

basis contained in Article 6.1 f) GDPR to process the data as included in the

membership file for direct marketing purposes. b) Transparency principle and information obligation

45. The defendant's right to process personal data for direct marketing purposes on the basis of his

legitimate interest is counterbalanced by the fact that the defendant must comply with the

objection that the data subject may at any time lodge against the processing of

personal data concerning him, without the data subject having to provide any

reasons (Article 21.2 GDPR and Article 21.3 GDPR).

Although the complainant indicates that he has not exercised his right to object,

the Dispute Resolution Chamber will examine to what extent the defendant has

complied with his information obligation under Article 12 in conjunction with Article 14

GDPR. After all, the information obligation on the part of the controller

stands alone as an obligation towards the data subjects from which the

right to transparent data processing arises for them (Article 5.1 a) GDPR).

46. As regards the information on the right to object (Article 14.2 c) GDPR): Article 21.4

16 GDPR specifically and expressly stipulates that this option, separately from the other

information, must already be included in the first message to the data subject, in this case the

complainant. However, the message that is the subject of the complaint does not in any way make the right to object clearly

known to the complainant. Moreover, the e-mail message only contains the option to click on

"Unsubscribe" at the very bottom without any further explanation for the benefit of the data

subject. The

data subject must be given the opportunity in an understandable manner to exercise his right

to object to the processing of his data for the purpose of direct

marketing, regardless of whether it concerns initial or further processing, to object

at any time and free of charge to such processing, including in the case of profiling

to the extent that it relates to direct marketing. That right must be explicitly, clearly and

separately from other information, brought to the attention of the data subject.

16Article 21.4 GDPR. The right referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be explicitly

brought to the attention of the data subject at the latest at the time of the first

contact with the data subject and presented clearly and separately from any other

information. Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 16/31

marketing. The requirement to emphasise the right to object, which would put the data subject in a meaningful position to exercise this right, is completely missing. Simply offering a click on “Unsubscribe” cannot be considered as expressly and clearly drawing attention to the right to object, which would enable the data subject to assess with full knowledge of the facts what consequences are associated with this “Unsubscribe”. However, Recital 70 of the GDPR stipulates that this right must be explicitly, clearly and separately from other information, drawn to the attention of the data subject. In the absence of proper notification of this right to object to the complainant at the time he was first contacted, the defendant acted in breach of Article 21.4 of the GDPR. 47. As regards the other information (Article 14.1 and 14.2 GDPR) that the controller must provide, this provision (Article 14.3 b) GDPR) also requires that this is done at the latest at the time of the first contact with the data subject. The first message to the complainant does not contain any information as such either. At the very least, the first message should have contained a link to the privacy policy in which this information is included in an accessible, concise and clear manner. Such a link was not present in the e-mail message to the complainant and the report of the Inspection Service also indicates that the various privacy statements on the

\[…\] were not coordinated. Since the first message to the complainant does not contain the slightest

reference to the necessary information to ensure transparent data processing, there is an infringement of Articles 5.1 a), 12.1 and 14 GDPR. c) Right of access

48. The complainant repeatedly informed the defendant that he requested that his request be followed up

to inform him of the origin of his data and the legal basis for processing them, without at any time requesting that

the data be erased. The defendant's response that the complainant's personal data were

erased cannot therefore be considered an appropriate response to the complainant's request to

find out in particular from the defendant how he obtained his personal data, indicating

the legal basis for the data processing on the part of the defendant, and in

general to obtain access to his personal data. 49. The Dispute Resolution Chamber establishes on the basis of the documents supporting the complaint that the complainant explicitly stated in his first request dated 3 October 2018 that he wanted to know how the defendant obtained his data and on what grounds they were processed, as well as that he wanted to have access to his personal data that the defendant had at its disposal.

17 See footnote 2. Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 17/31

50. However, no response was received from the defendant. However, on 7 November 2018 the complainant received another unwanted advertising e-mail from the defendant. On 8 November 2018 the complainant received the defendant's response to his first request stating that the complainant's data had been deleted. That same day, the complainant

replied by pointing out that his request was intended to obtain

access (origin, processing purposes, legal basis) to his

personal data, and not to have them erased. The defendant, in turn, states that

no data acquisition was carried out, but only a mailing was sent from the ticketing

and communication systems to all subscribers of the bankrupt football

club who had registered for this. Only after the intervention

of the First Line Service in the context of the mediation procedure that was

initiated by the complainant, the defendant explained on 11 December 2018

that the personal data of the former subscribers, including those of the

complainant, were obtained by purchasing the estate and all associated software

systems of the bankrupt club. Based on the data file thus obtained, the defendant wrote to the former subscribers in order to renew their subscription if desired, with the possibility to unsubscribe. The defendant states that his legitimate interest forms the basis for this.

51. These factual elements show that the complainant did not receive a response to the

separate elements pursuant to Article 15.1 GDPR to which the right of access as

exercised by him relates and where the statutory time limits as set out in Articles 12.3 and 12.4

GDPR were also not respected. As a result, the
18 19
defendant acted in breach of Articles 12.3 and 12.4 GDPR, as well as Article 15.1 GDPR.

18Article 12 GDPR.

\[…\]

3. The controller shall provide the data subject with information on the action taken

pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 without delay and in any event within one month of receipt

of the request. Depending on the complexity and number of the requests, that period may be

extended by a further two months if necessary. The controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request. Where the data subject submits the request by electronic means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where possible, unless the data subject requests otherwise.
4. If the controller does not comply with the data subject's request, the controller shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for the failure to comply,

and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority or seeking judicial remedy.
19Article 15 GDPR

1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being
processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information:
a) the purposes of the processing;

b) the categories of personal data concerned;
c) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular
recipients in third countries or international organisations;

d) where possible, the period for which the personal data are expected to be stored, or, if
that is not possible, the criteria for determining that period; Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 18/31

d) Other findings

52. The defendant makes a general observation in the report of the Inspectorate that the

report refers to case-law and opinions dating from after the moment at which the

defendant received the membership list. According to the defendant, this is part

of the Data Protection Authority's progressive insight on which the

defendant could not rely at the time of the takeover of the bankrupt estate.

53. The Dispute Chamber takes this consideration into account in its decision in the sense that it

decides to limit the infringements established to the essence of the complaint, namely

the investigation of the legal basis, the requirement of transparent provision of information and

communication, as well as compliance with the rights of the person concerned. This does

not mean, however, that the Dispute Chamber may not take into account later rulings or

interpretations of the law.

III. Corrective measures and sanctions

54. With regard to the established infringement of Articles 5.1 a), 12.1, 14 GDPR and 21.4 GDPR,

as well as of Articles 12.3, 12.4 GDPR and 15.1 GDPR, the Dispute Resolution Chamber decides to

impose an administrative fine pursuant to its powers

based on Article 83 GDPR and Article 100, §1, 13° WOG.

55. On 24 May 2023, the EDPB adopted Guidelines 04/2022 for the calculation of
20 administrative fines under the GDPR (hereinafter: the Guidelines) based

on Article 70, paragraph 1, e) GDPR. The Guidelines apply immediately, as they do not provide for transitional law for procedures that were already ongoing at the time of

the consent to the Guidelines.

56. The Guidelines describe a methodology for determining the amount of the fine as follows:

Step 1: which and how many acts and infringements are subject to assessment;

e) that the data subject has the right to request the controller to rectify or erase personal data or to restrict the processing of personal data

concerning him or her, as well as the right to object to such processing;

f) that the data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

g) where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, all available information on the source of

those data; (h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling referred to in Article 22(1) and (4), and,
at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the relevant and
expected consequences of such processing for the data subject.

20EDPB – Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (v2.1, 24 May 2023),
https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-01/edpb guidelines 042022 calculationofadministrativefines en 0.pdf. Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 19/31

Step 2: what amount forms the starting point for calculating the fine for the

infringements established (starting amount);

Step 3: which mitigating or aggravating circumstances, if any, arise that require an adjustment of the amount from step 2;

Step 4: which maximum amounts apply to the infringements and whether any

increases from the previous step do not exceed this amount;

Step 5: the assessment of whether the final amount of the calculated fine meets the

requirements of effectiveness, deterrence and proportionality, and if necessary is

adjusted accordingly.

57. The Dispute Chamber determines the size of the administrative fine on the basis of

this methodology. On 4 July 2024, the Dispute Chamber informed the

defendant via the sanction form that it intended to impose an administrative fine of

EUR 8,000. On 13 August 2024, the defendant submitted its response to the

sanction form to the Dispute Chamber. This will be discussed further below.

Step 1: Determining the acts and determining the infringements

58. In order to determine the starting amount of the fine, as described in the Guidelines, it must first be determined whether there is one or more sanctionable

acts. The starting point is that one and the same act can be formed by the same or

related processing activities. The term “related” refers to the principle that a single act can

consist of several parts that are performed with a single intention and that are so closely

related contextually (in particular with regard to identity of the data subject,

purpose and nature), in space and in time that they can be regarded, objectively, as

a single coherent act. 59. The infringements on the part of the defendant concern the non-compliance with the principle of transparency, the duty to provide information (Articles 5.1a), 12.1, 14 GDPR and 21.4 GDPR) and the disregard for the right of access (Articles 12.3, 12.4 GDPR and Article 15.1 GDPR).

60. In application of the Guidelines, the Dispute Resolution Chamber explains below that in the case at issue

are circumstances that constitute one and the same conduct, but that conduct does not

only constitute one, but several infringements, whereby it must be established that the

attribution of one infringement excludes the attribution of another infringement. After all, the

conduct that gave rise to the complaint and from which the infringements referred to above

arose consists of sending the unsolicited e-mail to the complainant. In accordance with the principle of speciality1, it is established that the

principle of transparency (Article 5.1 a) GDPR) as a basic principle forms an overarching concept that

is concretised in Article 12 GDPR in the form of an obligation to provide information on the

part of the controller, i.e. the defendant. Furthermore, the Guidelines refer to the consumption principle in cases where an infringement of one provision

regularly leads to an infringement of another provision, because one infringement

necessarily precedes the other. The Dispute Resolution Chamber thus concludes

that the lack of transparent information and communication (Article 5.1 a) and Article 12.1,

Article 14 and 21.4 GDPR) by the defendant led to the complainant subsequently

being denied the right of access, despite Article 12.3, 12.4 in conjunction with Article 15.1 GDPR.

61. The Dispute Resolution Chamber finds that these circumstances can be considered

as one and the same conduct constituting one or more infringements for which one

administrative fine is imposed.

Step 2: determining the starting amount

62. As described in the Guidelines, the starting amount of the

fine must then be determined. This starting amount forms the basis for the further

calculation in later steps, taking into account all relevant facts and

circumstances. The Guidelines state that the starting amount is determined on the basis of three

elements: i) the categorisation of the infringements according to Article 83, paragraphs 4 to 6, of the

GDPR; ii) the gravity of the infringement and iii) the turnover of the

company. These three elements are discussed below:

i) Categorisation of the infringements according to Article 83, paragraphs 4 to 6 of the

## GDPR

63. As stated in the Guidelines, almost all obligations of the controller are

categorised in the provisions of Article 83, paragraphs 4 to 6 of the

GDPR. The GDPR distinguishes between two types of infringements. On the one hand, infringements that are punishable under Article 83(4) GDPR and for which a maximum fine of EUR 10,000,000 applies (or in the case of an undertaking, 2% of the annual turnover, whichever is higher), and on the other hand, infringements that are punishable under Article 83(5) and (6) GDPR and for which a maximum fine of EUR 20,000,000 applies

(or in the case of an undertaking, 4% of the annual turnover, whichever is higher). By means of this

2The principle of speciality (specialia generalibus derogant) is a legal principle that implies that a more specific provision

(derived from the same legal act or different legal acts with the same legal force) takes precedence over
a more general provision, even though both provisions have the same purpose. See in this regard Case C-10/18 P, Marine
Harvest v Commission Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 21/31

distinction, the legislator has provided an initial indication in abstracto of the seriousness

of the infringement: the more serious the infringement, the higher the fine.

64. Since the Dispute Resolution Chamber finds that the defendant has infringed the transparency principle and the associated information obligation (Articles 5.1 a), 12.1, 14 GDPR and 21.4 GDPR), also ignoring the complainant's right of access (Articles 12.3, 12.4 GDPR and 15.1 GDPR), not only the basic principles of processing, but also the rights of the data subjects have not been complied with, which are fundamental and are therefore punishable in accordance with Article 83.5 a) and b) GDPR by an administrative fine of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, for an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. ii) Gravity of the infringement

65. In order to determine the gravity of the infringement, the

Guidelines require that account be taken of the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement,

as well as the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement and the categories of

personal data concerned.

66. Nature of the infringement – The Guidelines provide that the supervisory

authority may examine the interest to be protected by the provision infringed and the

place of this provision in the data protection framework. Transparency has long been an

important principle of EU law. Transparency should ensure that citizens have

confidence in the processes that affect them and help them to understand those processes,

for which they should be properly informed and, if necessary, to object to them. Transparency and the resulting obligation to provide information on the part of the controller enable data subjects to exercise their rights in relation to their personal data, in this case the right of access. Transparency must therefore be regarded as a fundamental principle of data protection and as an overarching concept that forms a whole with the information requirements and communication with data subjects about the exercise of their rights. Breaches of these core provisions therefore constitute serious infringements, which can be punished with the highest administrative fines provided for in the GDPR. 

22Article 1 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) stipulates that decisions shall be taken “as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen”; Article 11(2) of the TEU states that “the institutions shall maintain an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society”; and Article 15 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides, inter alia, that citizens of the Union have the right of access to documents of the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, with the aim that these Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies ensure transparency in their work. Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 22/31

67. Seriousness of the infringement — The assessment of the seriousness of the infringement requires that the various elements set out in Article 83.2(a) of the GDPR be assessed:

68. As regards the nature of the processing, the Litigation Chamber notes that the

sending of the unsolicited mailing took place in the context of the sporting activity

specific to a football club. In this regard, the Litigation Chamber states that the defendant does carry out the

data processing within a recreational context, but that this does not

alter the fact that the defendant, like any other controller, must pay the necessary

attention to compliance with the provisions of the GDPR. The infringement must therefore

be considered neutral in terms of its nature.

69. As regards the scope of the processing, the EDPB Guidelines on

data protection impact assessments 23 recommend that, in addition to the number of

data subjects, the volume of data, the duration or the permanent nature of the

data processing, as well as the geographical scope of the processing, should be

taken into account in order to determine whether personal data are processed on a large

scale.

70. The present case concerns the personal data of one data subject, namely the complainant, and

based on the defendant's statement to the complainant, the mailing in question

was sent to 6,000 addressees. This was not refuted by the defendant who

acknowledges that the mailing led to a mass registration of former subscribers, which resulted in 3,000 people purchasing a subscription.

71. The volume of personal data is rather small, since it only concerns the first name and

surname and the e-mail address of the persons concerned.

72. The Dispute Chamber states that when assessing the scope of the

data processing, it must be taken into account that the processing is limited to a

defined set of personal data that only concerns the membership list of former subscribers and therefore

has no wider application, but the fact that several thousand people are nevertheless

involved cannot be ignored.

This is an important element for the Dispute Chamber that has an impact on the

amount of the fine. 73. With regard to the purpose of the processing, the Dispute Resolution Chamber finds that the

processing was solely aimed at continuing the membership of the former subscribers, and therefore not at monitoring the complainant, nor at personal characteristics of the

23Guidelines for data protection impact assessments and determining whether processing is ‘likely to result in a high risk’ within the meaning of Regulation 2016/679, adopted on 4 April 2017, as amended and adopted on 4 October
2017, para. 5.

24Article 29 Data Protection Working Party – Guidelines for data protection impact assessments and determining

whether processing is ‘likely to result in a high risk’ within the meaning of Regulation 2016/679 (WP248, rev01, 4 October
2017), p. 12. Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 23/31

neither to assess the complainant nor to take measures with negative consequences for the

data subject. The processing of personal data does not constitute a core activity for

the defendant, but it is an important secondary activity in which, as the

defendant itself indicates, it is necessary to be able to reach the supporters by e-mail.

Consequently, the Dispute Chamber states that more weight should be given to the

infringements of the GDPR resulting from these necessary secondary activities.

74. Duration of the infringement – As regards the duration of the infringement, the Disputes Chamber notes that, despite the express request of the complainant on 3 October 2018 to obtain access to the personal data concerning him, the defendant did not give concrete effect to this request until 11 December 2018 following the mediation procedure at the First Line Service, through which the complainant was provided with information on the essential elements of his request for access, namely the origin of his data and the legal basis for the processing of the data. As regards the lack of transparency, including the provision of information and communication to the data subjects, the defendant only took measures to bring the privacy statement into line with the GDPR after the report of the Inspectorate on 1 December 2020. 75. Negligence or intentional nature of the infringement (Article 83.2.b) GDPR) — The

Litigation Chamber recalls that “intent” generally includes both knowledge and

wilfulness with regard to the characteristics of a criminal offence, while “unintentional” means

that there was no intention to cause the infringement, although the

controller or processor has breached the duty of care prescribed by law.

In other words, two cumulative elements are required for an infringement to be

considered intentional, i.e., knowledge of the infringement and

wilfulness with regard to that act. 76. As regards the element of intentionality, the Litigation Chamber also recalls

that the Court of Justice has set a high threshold for an act to be

considered intentional.27 For example, in criminal cases, the Court of Justice has held that

there is “serious negligence” rather than “intent” when “the person liable

commits a serious breach of his duty of care which he should and could have

taken, taking into account his capacity, his knowledge,

fines within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (WP253, 3 October 2017), p. 12.

28 his skills and with his individual situation”. Even though an undertaking

whose processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities

is expected to take sufficient measures to protect personal data

and to have a thorough understanding of its obligations in this regard, such a qualified
29 breach does not necessarily demonstrate that there has been an intentional infringement.

77. In other words, this means that a controller may also be

punished with an administrative fine under Article 83 GDPR for conduct falling

within the scope of the GDPR, where the controller could not have been

unaware that its conduct constituted an infringement, regardless of whether it

was aware that it was infringing the provisions of the GDPR.30 The defendant argues in this regard that

the context of the situation and the specific circumstances must be taken into account, referring to

the initial period of the applicability of the GDPR, as well as the fact that the

transfer of the membership file took place in the context of a bankruptcy in which neither the

trustee nor the processor made any reservations about the transfer of the data or the

sending of commercial messages to the customer file. The

defendant argues that the GDPR had just entered into force at the time of the

takeover of the bankrupt estate and acknowledges that compliance with the GDPR was not the

first item on the agenda at that time. Furthermore, the defendant also points out that the initial period of

the application of the GDPR – which virtually coincided with the takeover of the

bankrupt estate – was accompanied by uncertainty and ambiguity due to the open

descriptions of the provisions in the GDPR, which also led to the fact that

none of the parties involved took the principles of the GDPR into account during the

transfer. The defendant emphasises that the non-compliance with the GDPR can be

entirely attributed to ignorance on his part, but certainly not to bad intentions. According to the

defendant, this is supported by the fact that the report of the Inspection

Service was followed up by making adjustments to, among other things, the privacy

statement which now provides the required information. 78. According to the Dispute Chamber, there are no elements in the file that indicate

the intention on the part of the defendant to deliberately infringe Articles

5.1 a), 12.1, 14 GDPR and 21.4 GDPR, as well as Articles 12.3, 12.4 GDPR and 15.1 GDPR, but there is

serious negligence. The Dispute Chamber notes that the

and Arrow Generics v. Commission (ECLI:EU:C:2021:244), paragraph 97. Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 25/31

defendant disregards the fact that the GDPR provided for a transitional period

between its entry into force and the date on which the GDPR became applicable, being a

two-year period that was precisely designed to give controllers

sufficient time to comply by 25 May 2018, the date on which the

GDPR became applicable. In the opinion of the Dispute Chamber, the defendant has had ample time to make the necessary adjustments

in order to act in accordance with the GDPR, since, according to the information

available in the KBO, the defendant has been active since at least 2008, albeit under a different

name than that of the current club. The defendant cannot hide behind the

receiver or the processor in order to relieve itself of its responsibility in the event of

non-compliance with the GDPR. After all, the defendant has its own

accountability obligation in accordance with Article 5.2 of the GDPR. The Dispute Chamber is

prepared to show some leniency for the initial period in which the GDPR became

applicable, but it does concern important infringements of the GDPR for data

processing that constitutes an important secondary activity for the defendant, which

leads to the Dispute Chamber assigning an average weight to these infringements. 79. Categories of personal data to which the infringement relates (Article 83.2.g)

GDPR) — The processing at issue concerns only the processing of the first name, surname

and email address of the former subscribers of the bankrupt club, which do not

fall under the special protection provided by Articles 9 and 10 GDPR,

nor are likely to cause immediate damage or distress to the data

data subject. Consequently, the Dispute Chamber considers this to be neutral for the determination

of the amount of the fine.

iii) Turnover of the undertaking

80. The Dispute Chamber specifies that the most recent annual accounts filed by the

defendant relate to 2022 and should therefore take into account the turnover figures for 2022.

Since the turnover figures were not included in the 2022 annual

accounts, the Dispute Chamber should use the gross margin for 2022 as an alternative. This gross margin is negative and amounts to -2369 EUR, while that of 2021

is positive and amounts to 558,356 EUR. However, the Dispute Chamber only bases its decision on the

most recently available figures, namely those of 2022.

iv) Conclusion starting amount

a. Theoretical starting amount (based on the gravity of the infringement)

31 Crossroads Bank for Enterprises

32 Consulted via the website of the National Bank of Belgium Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 26/31

81. On the basis of Article 83.5 of the GDPR, the maximum fine is EUR 20,000,000 or,

for an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding

financial year, if this figure is higher, which is not the case here. Consequently, the

statutory maximum amount is EUR 20,000,000.

82. On the basis of the evaluation of the criteria set out above, the Litigation Chamber must

determine whether the infringement is considered to be of minor, medium or high seriousness. These

categories are without prejudice to the question of whether or not a fine may be

imposed. 33

83. This assessment is not a mathematical calculation in which the above-mentioned

factors are considered separately, but rather a thorough evaluation of the specific circumstances of the

case, in which all the above-mentioned factors are interrelated. Therefore, when assessing the

gravity of the infringement, the infringement as a whole must be considered. 34

▪ When calculating the administrative fine for infringements of minor

seriousness, the supervisory authority will set the basic amount for further calculation

at an amount between 0 and 10% of the applicable statutory maximum. ▪ When calculating the administrative fine for infringements of medium

seriousness, the supervisory authority will set the starting amount for further calculation

at an amount between 10 and 20% of the applicable statutory maximum.

▪ When calculating the administrative fine for infringements of high

seriousness, the supervisory authority will set the starting amount for further calculation

35 at an amount between 20 and 100% of the applicable statutory maximum.

84. As a rule, the more serious the infringement within the relevant category, the

36 higher the starting amount is likely to be.

85. The Dispute Resolution Chamber found that there was an infringement of Articles 5.1 a), 12.1,

14 GDPR and 21.4 GDPR, as well as Articles 12.3, 12.4 GDPR and 15.1 GDPR, which are included in the

infringements of Article 83.5 GDPR. The Litigation Chamber then made an analysis

the nature of the infringement, the purpose, scope and duration of the processing, as well as
the categories of personal data processed and the negligent nature of the infringement. 37

86. Based on the previous assessments of the above circumstances,

the Litigation Chamber finds that the infringement falling within Article 83.5 GDPR is

of medium seriousness. In doing so, the Dispute Resolution Chamber takes particular account of the

considerable scale of the processing, the relatively long duration of the infringements and the

defendant's failure to act in accordance with the GDPR. Consequently,

the starting amount for further calculation must be set at an amount

between 10% and 20% of the applicable statutory maximum. The Dispute Resolution

decides to determine a theoretical starting amount of EUR 3,000,000, i.e. 15% of the

applicable statutory maximum amount of EUR 20,000,000 (Article 83.5 GDPR).

b. Adjustment of the starting amount based on the size of the undertaking

87. The Dispute Chamber must then examine whether the starting amount should be adjusted

based on the size of the undertaking. This adjustment applies

to undertakings to which the static statutory maximum applies, namely

when the undertaking achieved a turnover of less than EUR 500 million

in the previous financial year. Since this is the case in the present case, the fine must be

adjusted to the size of the economic power of the undertaking whose annual

turnover is less than EUR 2,000,000.

88. The Litigation Chamber has already explained that the infringement found falls under Article 83.5 of the GDPR and is of average severity. For infringements referred to in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, of average severity, applied to an undertaking with a turnover of less than EUR 2 million, the fine amounts to 0.2 to 0.4% of the starting amount, whereby the fine may not be less than EUR 6,000 or more than EUR 12,000. 38

89. Taking into account the minimum and maximum amounts per level set in the Guidelines, the relevant gross margin of the defendants factors are listed in “ III. Step 2” the Litigation Chamber decides to set the final starting amount

of the established infringement (falling under Article 83.5 GDPR with average severity)
at EUR 9,000, i.e. 0.30% of the theoretical starting amount of

EUR 3,000,000.

Step 3: assessment of aggravating and mitigating circumstances

i) Assessment of the application of any aggravating or mitigating
circumstances

37See paragraphs 95 to 102 of this decision.
38EDPB – Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (v2.1, 24 May 2023),
p. 52. Decision on the substance 108/2024 — 28/31

90. As stated in the Guidelines, it must then be assessed whether, in the

circumstances of the case, there is reason to set the fine higher or lower

than the starting amount specified above. The circumstances to be taken into

account are listed in Article 83(2) GDPR. Each of the

circumstances listed in that provision may be assessed only once. 39 The previous step

has already taken into account the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement 40 , the

intentional or negligent nature of the infringement and the categories of personal data . 42

This leaves parts c to f and h to k of Article 83(2)

GDPR. 91. Previous relevant breaches by the controller or processor

(Article 83.2.e) GDPR) – The Litigation Chamber takes into account that no other proceedings have been brought against the defendant to date. Referring

to the Guidelines, the Litigation Chamber states that the absence of previous breaches

should be considered neutral and cannot be considered a mitigating factor, as compliance with the GDPR is the norm. 43

92. The manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach

(Article 83.2.h) – Since the Litigation Chamber became aware of the breach as a result

of a complaint, this element is considered neutral in accordance with the

Guidelines. 44

93. The extent to which cooperation has been provided with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and to limit the possible negative consequences thereof (Article 83.2.f)

GDPR) — The Dispute Resolution Chamber notes that the defendant has cooperated.

Although the report of the Inspection Service establishes a breach of the duty to cooperate

(Article 31 GDPR) on the basis of the finding that, in the opinion of the Inspection Service,

the defendant did not respond promptly to the questions asked, but that, after

the intervention of the defendant's counsel, the questions that had remained unanswered

until then were answered and a timely answer was also provided to the additional

questions, the Dispute Resolution Chamber decides that this is sufficient to state that the

defendant has provided the required cooperation. In addition, the

Litigation Chamber finds, on the basis of the documents in the file, that the defendant has

p. 33. Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 29/31

has given the Inspection Service's findings not only by drawing up

a privacy statement and cookie statement in accordance with the GDPR, but also

every future e-mail sent by the defendant contains a link to the

privacy statement with a view to providing sufficient information. This measure is

such as to limit the negative consequences for the rights of the data subject, which

is therefore considered a mitigating factor.5

94. Other mitigating or aggravating circumstances – The other factual

elements in the file are not such that they should be taken into account as

mitigating or aggravating circumstances. The context in which the data file was obtained, i.e. the bankruptcy of the previous football club, as well as

the time of its acquisition, namely shortly after the GDPR came into effect, was already taken into account

above. The Litigation Chamber therefore decides to consider this

circumstance as neutral.

95. Finally, the Litigation Chamber points out that the other criteria of Article 83.2. GDPR

are not such that they lead to a different administrative fine than that which the

Litigation Chamber determined in the context of this decision.

ii) Impact on the amount of the fine

96. In paragraph 86, the specific starting amount was set at EUR 9,000. In the

following paragraphs, any mitigating or aggravating circumstances were

examined. The Dispute Resolution Chamber ruled that the circumstance as described in

Article 83.2.c) GDPR, namely the measures taken to limit the damage suffered by the persons

involved, can be taken into account as mitigating. The other

circumstances that can be taken into account must be assessed as neutral.

Consequently, the fine is set at EUR 8,000.

Step 4: Checking whether the maximum amounts have been exceeded

97. As explained above, the maximum fine for the infringements established is

EUR 20,000,000. The administrative fine that the Dispute Resolution Chamber

proposes in the present decision is well below the limit of this statutory

maximum amount.

Step 5: Assessment of the effective proportionate and dissuasive nature

98. On the basis of Article 83.5. a) and b) GDPR, the Dispute Resolution Chamber may impose an

administrative fine for the infringements described above. As set out in the Guidelines, the imposition of a fine can be considered effective if it

45EDPB – Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (v2.1, 24 May 2023),),
p. 32. Decision on the merits 108/2024 — 30/31

achieves the purpose for which it was imposed. That purpose may be, on the one hand, to

punish unlawful conduct and, on the other hand, to promote compliance

with the applicable rules. As regards the deterrent effect, the

Litigation Chamber states that the administrative fine aims, on the one hand, to discourage

repetition by the defendant and to induce him to take measures aimed at providing transparent

information that respects the rights of the data subject, in particular with regard to

communication by e-mail addressed to an entire membership file. On the other hand, the deterrent effect also applies to

other controllers, in particular those with similar sporting

activities, in order to evaluate the operation and, if necessary, take appropriate measures

to prevent similar infringements. 46In addition, the Litigation Chamber considers that the

administrative fine is proportionate in view of the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement,

as well as the other factors in Article 83.2 GDPR as assessed in this decision. The

Litigation Chamber therefore finds that both objectives have been achieved and that the

administrative fine to be imposed is therefore dissuasive and proportionate.
