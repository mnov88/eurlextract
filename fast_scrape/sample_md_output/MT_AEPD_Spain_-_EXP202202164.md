## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the DPA because a website lacked a privacy policy, despite the personal data of website visitors being collected through multiple forms. The complaint was forwarded to the controller on 27 March 2022, who was given 1 month to comply with data protection regulations. The controller responded on 9 June 2022 stating "all sections of the website contain information boxes requiring users to be notified of a box with the following message: "I agree that my data provided in the contact form may be processed electronically and used for the purpose of contacting me. I am aware that I may revoke my consent at any time." "

### Holding

The DPA determined that at least five of the controller's webpages that requested personal data via webform did not provide information on the controller's privacy policy, and therefore violated [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). An initial administrative fine of €2,000 was imposed by the DPA, however the amount was reduced to €1,200 because the controller had acknowledged liability and voluntarily agreed to pay the fine. The controller also agreed to adopt appropriate measures to bring its actions into compliance with the data protection regulations within one month.

LEGAL BASIS

I

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/10

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of

Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

Furthermore, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, subsidiarily, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
According to Article 5.1 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data must be governed by the following principles:

“1. Personal data shall be:
a) processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently with the data subject (…)

2. The data controller shall be responsible for compliance with the provisions of paragraph 1 and capable of demonstrating this.”

One of the manifestations of the transparency principle is the right that the GDPR grants data subjects to receive information and the corresponding obligation that it imposes on the data controller to provide the data subject with the information detailed in Articles 12, 13, and 14 of the GDPR.

These last two provisions contemplate two different scenarios: either the data is obtained directly from the data subject (Article 13), as is the case with the data collection forms that ORI includes on its website, or the data is not obtained from the data subject (Article 14).

## Article 13 of the GDPR states:

“1. Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected, the

controller shall, at the time when such data are collected, provide the data subject
with all of the following information:
a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of its representative;
b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;

c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended and the legal basis for the processing;
d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party;
e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, where applicable;
f) where applicable, the controller’s intention to transfer personal data to a third country or international organization and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or, in the case of transfers indicated in Articles 46 or 47 or Article 49, paragraph 1, second subparagraph, reference to the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/10

adequate or appropriate safeguards and the means to obtain a copy of these or to the fact that they have been provided.

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time the personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:
a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or, where that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;

b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to, and rectification or erasure of, or restriction of processing of, personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to processing, as well as the right to data portability. data
c) where processing is based on Article 6(1)(a) or Article

9(2)(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent prior to its withdrawal;
d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
e) where the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
necessary requirement for entering into a contract, and where the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and is informed of the possible consequences of not providing such data;
f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, as referred to in Article 22(1) and (4), and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.

3. Where the controller plans to further process personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, the controller shall, prior to such further processing, provide the data subject with information about that other purpose and any additional information relevant under paragraph 2. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 shall not apply where and to the extent that the data subject already has the information.

Recitals 39 and 60 of the GDPR help clarify the scope of the right to information granted to data subjects.

Recital 39 states: “All processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. It must be absolutely clear to natural persons that personal data concerning them are being collected, used, accessed, or otherwise processed, and the extent to which such data are or will be processed. The principle

of transparency requires that all information and communication related to the processing of such data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that simple and clear language be used. This principle refers in particular to informing data subjects about the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing, as well as to additional information to ensure fair and transparent processing with respect to the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of the personal data concerning them that are being processed. Natural persons must be aware of the risks, rules, safeguards, and rights related to the processing of personal data, as well as how to assert their rights in relation to the processing. In
particular, the specific purposes for processing personal data must be
explicit and legitimate, and must be determined at the time of collection. \[...\].”

Recital 60 clarifies that “The principles of fair and transparent processing
require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and
its purposes. The controller must provide the data subject with all
further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the
personal data are processed. The data subject must also be informed of the existence
of profiling and of the consequences of such processing. If personal data
are collected from data subjects, they must also be informed of whether they are
obliged to provide them and of the consequences if they fail to do so.”

In the present case, upon examining the forms contained on ORI's websites requesting personal data, it is observed that at least five of them do not provide information on the company's privacy policy.

Therefore, in accordance with the evidence currently available, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered that the known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to ORI, for violation of Article 13 of the GDPR.

III
If confirmed, the aforementioned infringement of Article 13 of the GDPR could entail the commission of the infringements classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, which, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines," provides:

"Infringements of the following provisions shall be punished, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of 20 000,000 EUR maximum or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher:
(…)
b) the rights of data subjects pursuant to Articles 12 to 22;
(…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in Article 71 “Infractions,” establishes that
“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4,
5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements.”

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72 of the LOPDGDD states:

“1. Pursuant to Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

(…)

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/10

h) Failure to comply with the duty to inform the data subject about the processing of their personal data in accordance with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and 12 of this Organic Law.

IV
For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available for the initiation of sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the results of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the criteria established in Article 83.2 of the GDPR.

Furthermore, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the criteria established in Section 2 of Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD.

If the violation is confirmed, the data controller may be ordered to complete the privacy policy on all pages that collect personal data within the period specified in the sanctioning resolution, without prejudice to any other measures that may arise from the investigation of the procedure, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2 d) of the GDPR. According to which each supervisory authority may

“order the controller or processor to ensure that processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain manner and within a specified period…”. The imposition of
this measure is compatible with the sanction of an administrative fine, as provided
in Article 83.2 of the GDPR.

It is noted that failure to comply with the requirements of this body may be
considered an administrative offense under the provisions of the GDPR,
classified as an offense in Articles 83.5 and 83.6, and such conduct may lead to the
opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

Therefore, in light of the foregoing, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
HAS RESOLVED:

FIRST: TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEDURE against ORI, S.L., with NIF \*\*\*NIF.1,

for the alleged violation of Article 13 of the GDPR, as defined in Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

SECOND: APPOINT R.R.R. as investigating judge and S.S.S. as secretary, indicating that either of them may be challenged, if appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 23 and 24 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector (LRJSP).

THIRD: INCORPORATE into the disciplinary proceedings, for evidentiary purposes, the complaint filed by the complaining party and its documentation, as well as the documents obtained and generated by the Subdirectorate General of Data Inspection in the proceedings prior to the initiation of this disciplinary procedure.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/10

FOURTH: THAT for the purposes set forth in Article 64.2 b) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations, the sanction that may be applicable would be, for the alleged violation of Article 13 of the GDPR, as defined in Article 83.5 of said law, an administrative fine of €2,000.00.

FIFTH: NOTIFY this agreement to ORI, S.L., with Tax Identification Number \*\*\*NIF.1, granting it a hearing period of ten business days to formulate any allegations and present any evidence it deems appropriate. In its written allegations,

it must provide its Tax Identification Number and the procedure number that appears in the heading
of this document.

If it does not make any allegations regarding this initial agreement within the stipulated period, it
may be considered a resolution proposal, as established in Article
64.2.f) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP).

In accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP, the Court may acknowledge its liability within the period granted for submitting allegations to this initiation agreement; this will result in a 20% reduction in the sanction to be imposed in this procedure. With the application of this reduction, the sanction would be set at €1,600.00, and the procedure would be resolved with the imposition of this sanction.

Likewise, the Court may, at any time prior to the resolution of this procedure, voluntarily pay the proposed sanction, which will result in a 20% reduction in its amount. With the application of this reduction, the sanction would be set at 1,600.00 euros, and its payment will terminate the procedure.

The reduction for voluntary payment of the fine is cumulative with the reduction applicable

for acknowledgment of liability, provided that this acknowledgment
of liability is made clear within the period granted for submitting allegations at the opening of the procedure. Voluntary payment of the amount referred to
in the preceding paragraph may be made at any time prior to the resolution. In
this case, if both reductions were to be applied, the amount of the fine would be

set at €1,200.00.

In any case, the effectiveness of either of the two aforementioned reductions will be
conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the fine.

If you choose to voluntarily pay any of the amounts indicated above (€1,600.00 or €1,200.00), you must do so by depositing it into account no. ES00 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 opened in the name of the Spanish Data Protection Agency at the bank CAIXABANK, S.A., indicating in the account the reference number of the procedure that appears in the heading of this document and the reason for the reduction in the amount you are applying for.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/10

You must also send proof of payment to the Subdirectorate General of Inspection so that the procedure can continue in accordance with the amount paid.

The procedure will last a maximum of nine months from the date of the initiation agreement or, where applicable, the draft initiation agreement.
After this period, the procedure will expire and, consequently, the proceedings will be archived, in accordance with the provisions of Article 64 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data).

In compliance with Articles 14, 41, and 43 of the LPACAP (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data), you are advised that, from now on, notifications sent to you will be sent exclusively electronically, through the Single Authorized Electronic Address (dehu.redsara.es) and the Electronic Notification Service (notificaciones.060.es). If you do not access them, your rejection will be recorded in the file, the procedure will be deemed completed, and the procedure will be followed. You are hereby informed that you may provide this Agency with an email address to receive notice of the availability of notifications and that failure to provide this notice will not prevent the notification from being considered fully valid.

Finally, it is noted that, pursuant to Article 112.1 of the LPACAP, no administrative appeal may be filed against this act.

SECOND: On September 26, 2022, the respondent party proceeded to pay the penalty in the amount of 1,200 euros, making use of the two reductions provided for in the Initiation Agreement transcribed above, which implies acknowledgment of liability.

THIRD: Payment made within the period granted for submitting submissions upon opening the procedure entails the waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction and the acknowledgment of liability in relation to the facts referred to in the Initiation Agreement.

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary manner, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II

## Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), under the heading "Termination of Sanctioning Procedures," provides the following:

"1. Once a sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender acknowledges responsibility, the procedure may be terminated with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.

2. When the sanction is solely pecuniary in nature, or when a pecuniary sanction and a non-pecuniary sanction may be imposed, but the inadmissibility of the latter has been justified, voluntary payment by the alleged offender, at any time prior to the resolution, will entail the termination of the procedure, except with regard to restoring the altered situation or determining compensation for damages caused by the commission of the violation.

3. In both cases, When the sanction is solely monetary in nature, the
body competent to resolve the procedure shall apply reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the proposed sanction, and these reductions may be combined.
These reductions must be specified in the notification of initiation of the procedure, and their effectiveness shall be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of

any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

The percentage reduction provided for in this section may be increased by regulation."
