## English Summary

### Facts

An individual (data subject) together with his wife requested information from a bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (controller), regarding a mortgage loan.

It later came to the data subject’s attention that an advisor of the controller had forged his and his wife’s signature on a document entitled “Personal Data Protection Policy and Statement of Economic Activity”. This signature included opting in to the processing of personal data for commercial purposes by both the controller and partner companies, as well as for profiling.

The data subject went to a branch of the bank and inquired about this and was informed that this is something that the bank sometimes does in order to “speed up the procedures”.

The data subject filed a complaint with the AEPD (Spanish DPA) on 10 March 2023.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller had processed the data subject’s personal data without a lawful basis, in violation of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"). The DPA reasoned that the falsified signature of the data subject was being attributed to him and that it wrongly indicated he consented to processing of his personal data.

In determining an appropriate sanction, the DPA was influenced by the seriousness of the infringement, as well as the four previous infringements committed by the controller in the past year. The DPA initially set the fine at €200,000 but pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €120,000.

 File No.: EXP202305408

RESOLUTION TERMINATING THE PROCEDURE FOR RECOGNITION OF LIABILITY AND VOLUNTARY PAYMENT

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on

the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On December 3, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA, S.A. (hereinafter, BBVA), through the agreement transcribed below:

<<

File No.: EXP202305408

AGREEMENT TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEEDINGS

Regarding the actions taken by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following

FACTS

FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complainant) filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency on March 10, 2023. The complaint is directed against BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA, S.A. with NIF A48265169 (hereinafter, the respondent). The grounds for the complaint are as follows:

The complainant states that, together with his wife, he requested information from the respondent regarding a mortgage loan. He states that the respondent, without his consent, signed (impersonating the complainant) a document entitled "Personal Data Protection Policy and Declaration of Economic Activity," and that the same occurred with his wife. Neither of them recognized the handwritten signatures on the aforementioned documents.
He states that he went to a branch of the respondent to explain what had happened, stating that they should have contacted the client to come to the office and sign the corresponding documentation, but that the employee who assisted him told him that this is something they normally do "to expedite the process."

Along with the claim, he submits a copy of the disputed documentation, dated (...),
which contains the complainant's personal information, as well as

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/16

three checked boxes regarding the granting of consent for the processing of his personal data for commercial purposes by the respondent entity and collaborating companies, as well as for profiling. This document includes a handwritten signature. He also submits another document
regarding his wife, in identical conditions.

SECOND: In accordance with Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), this complaint was forwarded to the respondent so that they could analyze it and inform this Agency within one month of the actions taken to comply with the requirements set forth in the data protection regulations.

The notification, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter LPACAP), was received on May 2, 2023, as recorded in the acknowledgment of receipt included in the file.

On May 3, 2023, this Agency received a letter requesting information and stating the following:

"That on May 2, 2023, my client was notified of the "Transfer of Claim and Request for Information" regarding file number EXP202305408.

II. Based on the documentation attached to the claim, it is not possible for my client to identify the claimant and respond to the request, because documents Attachments 1 and 2 do not contain any information.
To prove the above, document number 1, "Transfer of Claim and Request for Information," is attached.

III. For the above reasons, we request this Agency to forward the referenced file to us again, with the documents that allow my client to identify the claimant and support the claim presented."

On June 9, 2023, this Agency sent a letter stating that it considered that access to the copy of the requested documents was not appropriate given that it had already been provided with everything necessary to respond to the request, requesting that, within the established period from receipt of this Agency's request for information, notified on May 2, 2023, it provide all the information requested therein.

THIRD: On June 10, 2023, in accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD (Legal Data Protection Act), the claim submitted by the complainant was admitted for processing.

FOURTH: On June 16, 2023, this Agency received a response letter stating that the information sent was insufficient due to illegibility and that they were unable to respond to the request. Specifically, it states the following:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/16

"On April 28, 2023, my client informed the AEPD that the communication received did not include the claimant's identification information and that Annexes 1 and 2 attached did not contain any information. The Agency requested a new communication and a new deadline. III. On June 13, 2023, we received a communication with reference EXP202305408 and subject "Request for a copy of a file," indicating that access to a copy of the requested documents is not permitted since the request has already been made. He sent what was necessary so that I could respond to the transfer."

The claim was forwarded again, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP). It was received on July 28, 2023, as recorded in the acknowledgment of receipt in the file.

On September 27, 2023, this Agency received a written response stating, among other things, the following:

"The A.A.A. was notified in writing of the decision agreed upon by my client regarding the claim filed with this Agency, as evidenced in Document No. 1 provided.

In this letter, it is communicated that the responsible parties involved have been informed of the facts reported by the claimant so that the necessary measures can be taken to correct situations such as those reported by the A.A.A.

Likewise, for your records, you are informed that, at present, there are no active positions in the entity in either your name or that of your wife.

The aforementioned communication was sent by mail to the address indicated in the claim transfer sent to us by this Agency, that is,
\*\*\*ADDRESS.1.

In Consequently, my client has complied with all legal requirements
provided for in the GDPR regarding the processing of personal data and the

free circulation of such data, responding to the request made by the A.A.A.

Similarly, and as stated in the response given by the SAC to this effect, the corresponding department has been informed of the facts reported by

the complainant in order to take the appropriate measures to ensure that similar situations do not occur in the future.

In light of the above, I REQUEST THIS AGENCY to consider the request submitted as a response, within the aforementioned procedure, and, in any case,

BBVA remains at this Agency's disposal for the purpose of clarifying, expanding, or explaining the
information provided."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/16

FIFTH: The Subdirectorate General of Data Inspection proceeded to carry out preliminary investigative actions to clarify the facts in question, pursuant to the functions assigned to the supervisory authorities in

Article 57.1 and the powers granted in Article 58.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Section Two, of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), having learned of the following:

The events occurred on January 10, 2023, and the complainant states in its

complaint of March 10 that it had gone to the respondent's branch to expose the falsification of the signatures.

The respondent responded to the notification on September 27, stating that it had addressed the complaint by sending a letter to the complainant, dated September 26.
The respondent did not respond to the remaining information requested by this AEPD in the notification.

The RAT records provided by the respondent mention the documents "General Privacy and Data Protection Policy of the Entity" and "Corporate Standard on Data Blocking and Deletion" as organizational security measures.

In the second request from this Agency, the respondent is asked for information regarding the retention of documents containing personal data:

“BBVA document describing the retention policy for such documents, or, failing that, a description thereof,” and

“Retention period established for each type of document, or for each category of personal data appearing in the documents, of which appear in the set of documents for the affected parties provided by BBVA on January 30.”

The respondent does not provide any documents; in its response, it states:

“\[…\] the Customer Personal Data Protection Policy states that personal data will be retained for the duration of the contractual relationship or as long as necessary for the specific purpose of each processing.
In addition, once the contractual relationship has ended, the data will be retained (i) to comply with the legal obligations incumbent on the Entity, such as compliance with the retention periods established by the legislator that must be observed in relation to specific cases or matters (e.g., prevention of money laundering) and (ii) during the statutory limitation periods for the exclusive purposes of formulating and defending claims or legal actions, allowing the right to effective judicial protection to be exercised.

Finally, it should be noted that, to ensure the successful implementation of the defined technical and organizational measures, the following controls have been implemented:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/16

Once a year, Regulatory Compliance will review the authorizations granted for access to blocked data and ensure that they have completed the required pre-verification process.

Annual review of the rules and procedures to verify whether they remain fully applicable or whether they require any modification or adaptation. The rules and procedures are published and available to all employees on the intranet.

Periodic controls to ensure compliance with the blocking procedure.
The customer data blocking control is implemented in the systems and is executed automatically. Additionally, proper operation is verified annually.

Signing of the documents:

The complainant stated that the respondent sent them the data protection documents, that they did not sign them, and that they do not recognize the signatures appearing therein as their own.

In the documents submitted with the complaint, "PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION POLICY AND DECLARATION OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY," with the details of the complainant and their spouse, the consent options are indicated on page 5, the signatures are on page 40, and the expression "IN-PERSON OFFICE ATTENTION" appears in the signature certification at the bottom of page 42.

The respondent states:

"First of all, we must bear in mind that, currently, it is not possible to sign the LOPD (document submitted with the complaint) by hand in commercial offices; it must be signed on the corresponding tablet. Therefore, when collecting a client's signature, the DEFERRED signature option will be selected first.

It should be noted that the option to defer signature is only allowed for pre-contractual, contractual, and mandatory personal documentation.
Similarly, remote signature is only available for Individuals.

Deferring a signature generates a series of email notifications to both the client and the manager \[…\]

Once the document has been signed via remote signature, it will be automatically filed in the client's Digital Library (Contract Library)
with the fingerprint embedded at the end of the document with information regarding the channel, date, and time the client signed it.
As in the case at hand, all documentation signed by the claimants, as well as documentation provided by them, is located in their Contract Library.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/16

Likewise, there are other ways to sign the LOPD, such as through the bbva.es website, the BBVA app, mobile phone, etc.

The contractual relationship with the complainants is extensive, and there are numerous documents signed by them that show that, except for the
case at hand, BBVA has always acted with the utmost diligence and respect for data protection regulations. In the case at hand, an isolated and isolated incident, once BBVA became aware of what had happened, it began to investigate the events.

The investigation reveals that the branch manager did not follow the procedure for customer signatures, even though BBVA has established the proper processes for obtaining customer signatures and its employees are fully aware of these processes.

The respondent submitted, along with its response to the request dated January 25, 2024, a video that provides instructions for its employees on the need not to pre-check consent boxes on documents and to supervise client signature locations.

The following excerpt is excerpted from the submission:

(…)

Having requested information again on March 13, 2024, the respondent, in its response dated April 18, 2024, repeats the statements already made and submits, along with its response, two videos identical to the one already submitted in its previous response to the first request.

It also submitted another video containing instructions on the need not to provide client information to unauthorized third parties, and another video, which emphasizes the aforementioned, from which the following excerpt is excerpted:

(…)

The respondent, in turn, states in its response to 04/18/2024 regarding the dissemination of its communications:

“Regarding the document that outlines the procedure that employees must follow regarding the signing of documents by clients, this representation has already provided, as document no. 6 of the document submitted on 01/25/2024, the explanatory video of the aforementioned procedure, which was sent at the time to all employees for their information and application through the internal communication HOY.

However, this representation again provides the aforementioned video, which records the procedure, as document no. 1.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/16

Regarding the accreditation of employees' knowledge of the aforementioned procedure, the HOY communication that included the aforementioned video was sent to Commercial Banking with a total of 12,617 recipients and to the Entity's Central Services, with a total of 2,602 recipients.

The respondent also states in its response of 04/18/2024:

“\[…\] the main measure adopted by BBVA regarding the facts at issue here was to inform the Entity's Internal Audit Department of the same in order to conduct an internal investigation.

\[…\] the results of the investigation were submitted to the Entity's Disciplinary Committee for its decision \[…\]”

“ \[…\] The Entity's Internal Audit Department's function is,

among others, to help the BBVA Group meet its objectives by providing objective assurance, advice, and risk-based knowledge to evaluate and improve risk management. Among the main responsibilities of this function are providing independent verification and assurance that the BBVA Group's units and activities \[…\] comply with the defined internal policies, standards, and procedures and applicable external regulations.”

“In short, BBVA has a department specialized in (i) detecting
possible actions contrary to the defined internal procedures or applicable external regulations and (ii) investigating such actions that are brought to its attention so that the individuals involved cease to carry out such actions and that their actions cause the least negative impact on the Entity's customers.”

“To this end, BBVA has implemented various measures, including, for example:”

“Sending warning sheets on bad practices to the entire branch network.
For example, the one generated in March 2024 indicated
the importance of the correct use of personal data. These warning sheets provide employees with information on how they should serve customers in certain specific cases, the
consequences that failing to heed these warnings can cause, as well as various tips and reminders regarding customer service.”

(…)

“The corresponding warning sheet is scheduled to be sent in May of this year, reminding all employees of the
need to have customer documentation duly signed.”

“Signature quality checks on documents signed on tablets by the

branch network. An average of 750 reviews are currently performed each
month to identify the consistency of the signature with the comparison of the digital signature in BBVA's systems.”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/16

“Office visits. Each year, around 1,000 of the 1,848 existing offices are visited. Various checks are carried out at the offices, and

during this visit, the importance of orthodoxy when performing the job is highlighted, including the relevance of, among other things, LOPD documents.”

FIFTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool, the entity
BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYAARGENTARIA, S.A. is a (…) established in 1900,
with a turnover of (…) euros and (…) employees, in 2023.

LEGAL BASIS

I
Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, this Organic Law, the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary manner, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Preliminary Questions

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.1 of the GDPR, it is established that personal data is being processed since the respondent processes the complainant's personal data, such as: name and surname and national identity document number, address, date of birth, marital status, educational level, income.

Likewise, the respondent carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, given that it is the party that determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to Article 4.7 of the GDPR: "controller" or "controller": the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that, jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing.

III
Breached Obligation. Lawfulness of Processing

Article 6.1 of the GDPR establishes the circumstances under which the processing of personal data may be considered lawful. C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/16

Regarding the lawfulness of processing personal data, Article 6.1 of the GDPR establishes the following:

“1. Processing shall only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:

a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;

b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;

c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject;

d) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;

e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;

(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, provided that such interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
The provisions of point (f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their duties. In the present case, the file contains a document, submitted with the complaint, containing the complainant's personal data along with a handwritten signature that the complainant does not recognize as his own. This document contained three boxes marked regarding the granting of consent for the processing of the complainant's personal data for commercial purposes by the respondent entity and collaborating companies, as well as for profiling.

After the complaint was filed, the respondent stated, after investigating the facts, that "the bank branch manager did not respect the procedure for customer signatures." The respondent thus appears to acknowledge the facts and, therefore, the alleged lack of a legitimate basis for processing the complainant's personal data.

Therefore, in accordance with the evidence available at this time, the decision to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, is considered to have been made. Data processing without a legitimate basis, since correct personal data of the complainant was being linked to a signature other than their own; furthermore, the boxes for consent to the processing of their personal data for commercial purposes by the respondent entity and collaborating companies, as well as for profiling, were checked. These facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to the respondent party for violating the principle of lawfulness provided for in Article 6.1 of the GDPR.

(…) b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing established in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

V
Proposed Sanction

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available for the initiation of sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following criteria established in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

- The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered (paragraph a): due to the severity of the identity theft caused by the signing of documents on behalf of the complainant by personnel of the respondent party.

As an aggravating factor:

- Any previous violation committed by the controller or processor
(section e): The entity has previously been sanctioned for other violations of the

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/16

GDPR, LOPDGDD. In the last year alone, the following violations are recorded:
PS/00677/2022, PS/00147/2023, PS/00456/2022, and PS/00115/2023.

Likewise, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following criteria established in section 2 of Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD:

As an aggravating factor:

- The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (section b): the defendant, in the course of its activity, carries out a high volume of personal data processing.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 6.1 of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €200,000.00.

VI
Adoption of Measures

If the infringement is confirmed, the controller may be ordered to adopt appropriate measures to bring its actions into compliance with the regulations mentioned in this act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2 d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to ensure that processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period..." The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction consisting of an administrative fine, as provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR.

Please note that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by this body in the sanctioning resolution may be considered an administrative violation pursuant to the provisions of the GDPR, classified as a violation in Articles 83.5 and 83.6, and such conduct may lead to the opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

However, in accordance with Article 83.7 of the GDPR, and the provisions of

Article 77.2 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), due to the category of the party allegedly responsible for the infringement, said sanction would be replaced by a declaration of infringement.

FIFTH: NOTIFY this agreement to BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA, S.A., with Tax Identification Number (NIF) A48265169, granting it a hearing period of ten business days to formulate its allegations and present any evidence it deems appropriate.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/16

Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Termination of the Procedure

## Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), under the heading "Termination of Sanctioning Procedures," provides the following:

"1. Once a sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender acknowledges responsibility, the procedure may be terminated with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.

2. When the sanction is solely monetary in nature, or when one monetary sanction and another non-monetary sanction may be imposed, but the inadmissibility of the second sanction has been justified, voluntary payment by the alleged offender, at any time prior to the resolution, will entail the termination of the procedure, except with regard to restoring the altered situation or determining compensation for damages caused by the commission of the offense. Infraction.

3. In both cases, when the sanction is solely monetary in nature, the competent body responsible for resolving the procedure will apply reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the proposed sanction, which may be combined.
These reductions must be specified in the notification of initiation of the procedure, and their effectiveness will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

The percentage reduction provided for in this section may be increased by regulation.

III
Voluntary Payment and Acknowledgment of Liability

In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 85 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Procedure Act), the notified initiation agreement provided information on the possibility of acknowledging liability and voluntarily paying the proposed penalty, which would entail two cumulative reductions of 20% each. With the application of these two reductions, the penalty would be set at €120,000.00, and its payment would imply the termination of the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

Following notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement, BBVA has proceeded to acknowledge liability and voluntarily pay the penalty, taking advantage of the two planned reductions. Pursuant to Section 3 of Article 85 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code), the effectiveness of the aforementioned reductions will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the penalty.

It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of the LPACAP, as well as the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this matter, the exercise of voluntary payment by the alleged liable party does not exempt the administration from the obligation to resolve and notify all proceedings, regardless of their initiation. Similarly, Article 88 of the aforementioned law establishes that the resolution that concludes the proceedings will decide all issues raised by the interested parties and any other issues arising from them.

Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating sanctions, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: TO DECLARE the commission of the violations and CONFIRM the sanctions determined in the operative section of the initiation agreement transcribed in this resolution.

The sum of the aforementioned amounts amounts to a total of €200,000.00.

After BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA, S.A. has made prompt payment and acknowledged liability, pursuant to Article 85 of the LPACAP, the aforementioned total is reduced by 40%, which represents the final amount of €120,000.00.

The effectiveness of the aforementioned reductions is, in all cases, subject to the withdrawal or waiver of any action or appeal through administrative channels.

SECOND: DECLARE the termination of procedure EXP202305408, in accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP.

THIRD: NOTIFY BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA, S.A. of this resolution.

FOURTH: In accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP, which conditions the reduction for voluntary payment and acknowledgment of liability on the withdrawal or waiver of any action or appeal in administrative proceedings, this resolution will become final in administrative proceedings and fully enforceable upon notification.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.
