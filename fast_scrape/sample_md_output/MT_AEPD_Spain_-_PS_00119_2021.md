## English Summary

### Facts

A worker lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against their employer, alleging that the company was using their image on their new website, Facebook and Instagram.

The data subject asked the controller to take down the images. The controller replied that they had obtained the data subject's consent, although provided no evidence of it. The data subject pointed that the controller did not have their consent, and additionally that they thought that the images being used would remain in the internal sphere of the company.

The DPA required clarification from the controller, but did not receive any response.

### Holding

The AEPD concluded that the controller had violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"), since they could not prove they had obtained the data subject's consent to publicly display their image online. For this violation, the DPA fined the controller €6000.

Additionally, the DPA determined that the controller had violated [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"), since they had not complied with the data subject's erasure request. For this violation, the DPA fined the controller an additional €3000.

## Comment

_An administrative appeal (recurso de reposición) was filed by the defendant, and dismissed by the AEPD on the grounds that no new facts or arguments were presented. The decision can be found [here.](https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/reposicion-ps-00119-2021.pdf)_

7) It is not proven that the defendant has a legitimate basis for the treatment of the
photos of the claimant.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority, and

as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

                                             II

The RGPD defines data processing in article 4.2 of the RGPD:
  "Any operation or set of operations carried out on personal data or

sets of personal data, whether by automated procedures or not, such as the
collection, registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or modification,
extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form
to enable access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction "

The treatment of images, in this case in photos, must have a legitimation basis,
of some listed in article 6.1 of the RGPD.

By having images of the claimant, personal data, considering that no

There is a legitimate basis for this, the defendant is charged with the commission of an alleged
infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD that indicates:

  1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:

  a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data for one
or various specific purposes;

  b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is
part or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;

  c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

  d) the treatment is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or another person
physical;

  e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;

  f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued by the
responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that such interests are not
the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party prevail
require the protection of personal data, in particular when the interested party is a child.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/10

  The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not apply to the treatment carried out
by public authorities in the exercise of their functions. "

Once the positive fact of the treatment has been accredited, it corresponds to prove compliance with the

requirements to the claimed. In this sense, it is not proven that the exposure of the object photographs
of the claim in various social networks on the website itself will have one of the bases
legitimizing that indicates the article 6 of the RGPD, the commission of the infraction is accredited
charged.

                                                   III

The right of deletion is the right of the interested party to demand from the person responsible for the treatment,
in this case, the complained party, who excludes personal data from the processing. The right

The deletion process is a reflection of the informative self-determination of control of the data of its
tular.

The right of deletion is contained in article 17 of the RGPD as the right of the interested party,
or concerning your data, and at the same time implies an obligation of the person in charge (of the treatment

ment), indicating:

        1. The interested party shall have the right to obtain without undue delay from the person responsible for the
the deletion of personal data concerning him, which will be obliged to
primary without undue delay the personal data when any of the circumstances concur

following:

        a) the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which
were collected or otherwise treated;

        b) the interested party withdraws the consent on which the treatment in accordance is based

with Article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), and this is not based on
other legal basis;

        c) the interested party opposes the treatment in accordance with article 21, paragraph 1, and does not
other legitimate reasons for the treatment prevail, or the interested party opposes the treatment

pursuant to Article 21 (2);

        d) the personal data has been unlawfully processed;

Failure to comply with the right to delete photographs exhibited by the claimed in

its website and social networks violate article 17 of the RGPD.

                                                   IV

Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides: “Each control authority will have all the
following corrective powers listed below:

                                                 V

  Regarding these two offenses and the penalties, Article 83.5 of the RGPD refers:

  "Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with section
2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company,
of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global business volume of the
previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest amount:

  a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for consent

in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

  b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22. "

                                                 SAW

The offenses are classified in article 72 of the LOPDGDD:

                                                 VII

The determination of the sanctions to be imposed in the present case requires observing the
provisions of articles 83.1) and .2) of the RGPD, precepts that, respectively, provide what is
following:

    "one. Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
