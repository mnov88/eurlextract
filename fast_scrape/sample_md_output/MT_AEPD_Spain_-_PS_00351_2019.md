## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a second complaint submitted in June 2019 by a Spanish citizen stating that, after a first complaint (July 2018) in which he informed the AEPD that he had exercised his rights of access and erasure before the data controller without results (and, according to which, the AEPD had issued a decision requesting the data controller to grant such rights), the data controller only granted the erasure right to the citizen, but not the access right.

The data controller answered to the AEPD investigation requests that it had sent the citizen the corresponding information on the reason why it could not grant such access right: it had not been able to do so because it had already managed and granted the erasure right also requested.

### Dispute

Did the data controller infringe its obligation to fulfill the data subject's rights of access and erasure?

### Holding

The AEPD found that the data controller did not comply with its previous decision (as it did not grant the access right to the citizen) and, after considering some aggravating (the data controller has the consideration of a big company) and extenuating (the data controller has not obtained any benefits from its actions) circumstances, it decided to impose a fine of 30,000 € to the data controller.

Procedure No: PS/00351/2019
938-051119 RESOLUTION OF PENALTY PROCEEDINGS
The procedure conducted by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and on the basis of the following:
BACKGROUND
FIRST: The Spanish Data Protection Agency (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos) proceeded with the opening of legal protection, TD/00127/2019, on the basis of the following facts:
On 27 July 2018, Mr A.A.A.  ( the complainant) exercised the rights of access to and disposal of Telefónica Móviles España, S.A.U. with NIF A78923125 (hereinafter: the respondent party).In particular, it requested data protection (access rights and deletion).
SECOND:The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency, made an appeal under Law TD/00127/2019 on 4 June 2019, to review the complaint made by A.A.A. and to  invite the respondent to submit, within ten working days following notification of the present decision, to the complainant certifying that he has complied with his right of access or a reasoned refusal to state reasons why his or her request should not be granted.
That agreement was served on the party claimed on 10 June 2019.
THIRD:On 20 June 2019, he received a letter from the complainant in which he states that the time-limits allowed to the respondent party had been exceeded by the latter’s decision.
Despite having upheld the decision with regard to the right of access which was not served, the party complained against still has no bearing on that right.
The appellant requested the right to have access to and erasure and was only satisfied that he was therefore asking the Agency to act accordingly.
FOURTH:The appeal was transferred to the request for production of the claims which it considered appropriate and, on 1 August 2019, in those arguments, it stated that they had complied with the requested duty and took the view that only the deletion of the data was requested.
In excess of the deadline set for compliance with the aforementioned Resolution, it is not apparent from this Agency that it was complied with. 
oepd
 FIFTH:On 19 November 2019, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the respondent in accordance with Articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015 of 1 October 2015 on the Common Administrative Procedure of the Public Administrations (hereinafter referred to as the LPACAP), on the alleged breach of Article 58 (2) GDPR as laid down in Article 83 (5) of the GDPR.
SIXTH:At the time of notification of the said initiation agreement, the respondent lodged a written statement stating, in essence, that the certificate was sent to the complainant with information on the cause for which access to his data was not possible, based on the request and handling of the deletion of his data, and that, in view of the circumstances of the case, it is proposed that the proceedings be closed.
SEVENTH:On 10 January 2020, the procedure instructor agreed to the opening of a probationary period, taking into account the previous investigative measures, TD/00127/2019, as well as the documents provided by the respondent.
EIGHT:On 5 February 2020, 10 of the same month and year was notified of the Motion for Resolution, on alleged breach of Article 58 (2) GDPR as laid down in Article 83 (5) GDPR, a fine of EUR 30,000.
The respondent submitted observations on the Motion for Resolution containing, in essence, the same facts and arguments as set out in the arguments of the initiating agreement.
It adds that that party can only be considered to have complied with the decision on the protection of rights TD/00127/2019, in so far as the claimant replied to the complaint.
Consequently, the respondent requests that account be taken of the circumstances that have occurred in the facts which are the subject of the proceedings, that the termination of the proceedings or the amount of the penalty laid down in the Motion for Resolution be terminated.
FACTS
SOLELY:Telefónica Móviles España, S.A.U. has not sent the complainant the full access to his data, despite the decision of the Director of the Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (Spanish Data Protection Agency) to provide full access to his data.
As a result, for a breach of this resolution, and as it was notified to the entity in question, such facts can be understood as the offence referred to in Article 83 (5) (e) of the GDPR, which will be sanctioned in accordance with Article 58 (2) GDPR. 
oepd

‘5. Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject to administrative fines up to EUR 20 000 000, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:
e)	non-compliance with a resolution or a temporary or definitive limitation on the processing or suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(2) or failing to provide access in violation of Article 58(1).”

j)	adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42; and
k)	any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits gained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.’
With regard to Article 83 (2) (k) of the GDPR, Article 76 of the GDPR,  ‘Sanctions and remedial measures’, provides:
‘2. In accordance with Article 83 (2) (k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, account may also be taken of:
a)	The continued nature of the infringement.
