## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen (the claimant) stating that he had requested his right to erasure to the defendant, but that he did not receive any kind of answer.

### Dispute

The AEPD requested the defendant to grant or to reasonably deny such right to erasure to the claimant within a period of ten days. The defendant did not answer any requirements of the AEPD, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed Article 58(2) GDPR, as it did not give any answer to the claimant when he requested his right to erasure, nor it followed the request of the AEPD. Consequently, after considering some circumstances \[(i) there is a wilful misconduct by the defendant, and (ii) basic personal data have been affected\], the AEPD decided to impose a fine of € 2000 to the defendant.

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

                                                 III

       The RGPD deals in its article 58 with the powers of each control authority. The
section 1.a) provides:

       "1. Each supervisory authority will have all the powers of investigation indicated
then:

       a) order the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment and, where appropriate, the representative
of the person in charge or the person in charge, who provide any information required for the
performance of their duties.

       The offense for which the claimed entity is responsible is classified
in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading “General conditions for the imposition of
administrative fines ”, it states:

       "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the

section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Euros or, in the case of
a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total turnover
annual global of the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:

       e) failure to comply with a resolution or a temporary or definitive limitation of the
treatment or suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority with
pursuant to article 58 (2), or failure to provide access in breach of article 58,

Paragraph 1."

       Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Rights
Digital (LOPDGDD) in its article 72.1 m), under the rubric “Infractions considered very

grave ”provides:

       "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (E.U.) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose a

substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

        (…)

       m) Failure to comply with the resolutions issued by the protection authority of
       competent data in exercise of the powers conferred by article 58.2 of the

       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                                 IV

       In the case analyzed here, it has been proven that the claimant exercised his

right of deletion before the claimed entity, your request did not obtain the answer
legally enforceable.

       Likewise, after the evidence obtained, there is no record that the claimed party attended the
right of the claimant, as required by the Director of the Protection Agency
of Data, in the estimated resolution of the protection of right TD / 00128/2019, consisting of

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/8

   send the claimant a certification stating that he has met the right to
   deletion exercised by the latter or justly denied, it should be considered that the entity
   claimed violated article 83.5.e) of the RGPD, which sufficiently motivates the present

   sanctioning procedure.

          It is clear that on August 4, 2019 the resolution of legal protection was notified
   to the claimed party, urging it to, within the following ten business days, send
   certification to the claimant stating that he has complied with the right to erasure
   exercised by the latter, or is reasonedly denied indicating the reasons for which the

   requested deletion, however, it has not been verified that any of the
   the two senses.

          It must be stated that the claim was transferred to the claimed party on
   January and April 4, 2019, with January 25 and April 5 as the acceptance date

   of the same year.

          On July 24, 2019, compliance with said
   resolution with the date of receipt and not withdrawn on August 4, 2019.

          On July 12, 2020, the agreement to initiate this proceeding was notified
   sanctioner, without having made any allegations to it.

                                                    V

           "Each supervisory authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines

           "Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
   individual case, as an additional or substitute for the measures referred to in article 58,
   section 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose an administrative fine and its amount
   in each individual case, the following will be duly taken into account:

   28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/8

    i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been ordered
    previously against the person in charge or the person in charge in relation to the same
    subject, compliance with said measures;
    j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms of

    certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and
    k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
    such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through
    through the offense. "

             Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76, “Sanctions
    and corrective measures ”, provides:

             "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
    The following may also be taken into account:

             a) The continuing nature of the offense.

             h) The submission by the person in charge or in charge, with character
    voluntary, to alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases where the
    that there are controversies between those and any interested party. "

           In accordance with the transcribed precepts, in order to set the amount of the sanction of
    fine to be imposed in the present case on the entity claimed as responsible for a
    offense typified in article 83.5.e) of the RGPD, the following are considered concurrent
    factors:
