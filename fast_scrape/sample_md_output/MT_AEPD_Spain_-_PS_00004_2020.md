## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant had installed a video surveillance system with several video cameras directed to the public space that could be not compliant with the data protection legislation, and that they do not offer the corresponding legal information poster.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests stating that the video surveillance system does offer the corresponding legal information poster in a visible area. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure, and it determined that the video surveillance system obtained disproportionate images from the adjacent public road.

### Holding

Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have infringed the data minimisation principle as per Article 5(1)(c) GDPR: on the basis of the available evidences, the defendant has installed a video surveillance system that obtains public space images without a justified reason. Consequently, after considering some aggravating/mitigating circumstances \[(i) the defendant is a small family company and it has collaborated with the AEPD, (ii) there is a minor negligence of the defendant, and (iii) there is no justified cause in order to obtain public space images with the surveillance camera\], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 1,500 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine with two possible discounts: (i) acknowledging of its liability (1,200 €) and early voluntary payment (900 €). The defendant agreed to both concepts, so it paid 900 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD. Finally, the defendant is also required to redirect or relocate the surveillance camera in order to respect third party rights, as well as to include the corresponding information poster.
