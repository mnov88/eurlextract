## English Summary

### Facts

The CNIL adopted a reference methodology for processing data from the main base of the National Health Data System (SNDS).

This methodology would apply to organisations conducting research, studies, or evaluations in the field of health within the framework of their legitimate interests. Data controllers who meet the conditions set out in the methodology and who submit a declaration of compliance with it are authorised to implement their processing operations, provided that they have also obtained a favourable opinion from an independent community (CESREES); responsible for issuing opinions on proposed studies requiring the use of health data, prior to authorisation by the CNIL.

This will ensure that the privacy of individuals is protected while simultaneously facilitating researchers when accessing the SNDS.

### Holding

To begin with, the CNIL reminded that the data controllers concerned with this methodology are only those for whom the implementation of the research, study or evaluation in the field of health is necessary for the pursuit of a legitimate interest within the meaning of [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR").

The CNIL also clarified that the processing of personal data in these circumstances could be implemented once a controller has made a declaration of conformity with the new reference methodology. Where there is no conformity, the processing must be subject to prior consultation from the CNIL. Additionally, the CNIL provided that every three years, the controller should send the CNIL and the CEREES a report summarising the use of the methodology during this period and that each study should be registered in the public Health Data Hub (PDS) and be published at the end of the data processing.

Moreover, the CNIL stated that, in accordance with [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), the processing must be compliant with the principle of data minimisation, meaning that the data must be relevant, adequate and limited to what is necessary for the study for which they are processed. The CNIL also noted that the data should be kept up to date and that only authorised persons may access it. It further mandated that all the information on the data processing mentioned in [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR") be made available on the website of the controller and, where appropriate, the research laboratory or research office.

Additionally, the CNIL reminded the exercise of the rights of data subjects to be complied with and for the principle of transparency to be respected. In terms of data retention, the CNIL ascertained that the period should be limited to what is strictly necessary for the duration of the study but should not exceed five years from the last effective availability of the data. This period may exceptionally be extended for a maximum of two years upon reasoned request to the CESREES. After the end of the study, the personal data may not be retained for more than five years.

Lastly, the CNIL reiterated that under [Article 28 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR "Article 28 GDPR"), commitments should be in place between data controllers and possible processors and that a DPO should be designated pursuant to [Article 37 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR"), who should keep records of the processing activities under [Article 30 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_30_GDPR "Article 30 GDPR"). Moreover, the CNIL mandated that the data processed may not be transferred outside the EU, and impact assessments should be carried out in accordance with [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR"), reviewed and updated regularly.

The decision below is a machine translation of the French original. Please refer to the French original for more details.

Deliberation No. 2023-083 of July 20, 2023 approving a reference methodology relating to the processing of data from the main database of the National Health Data System implemented for research, study or evaluation purposes in the field of health by organizations acting within the framework of their legitimate interests (MR-008)

The National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties,

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing the Directive 95/46/EC;

Having regard to law n° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended relating to data processing, files and freedoms, in particular its articles 66, 72 et seq.;

Considering the public health code, in particular its article L. 1461-3;

After hearing the report from Ms. Valérie PEUGEOT, commissioner, and the observations of Mr. Damien MILIC, Government commissioner;

Adopts a reference methodology relating to the processing of data from the main base of the National Health Data System implemented for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health by the organizations acting within the framework of their legitimate interests (MR-008).

The president

Marie-Laure DENIS

Reference methodology relating to the processing of data from the main database of the National Health Data System implemented for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health by organizations acting within the framework of their legitimate interests (MR-008)

Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR), and in particular Article 5, point 2, provides that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the principles of the regulation are respected.

## Article 9(4) of the GDPR specifies that Member States may maintain or introduce additional conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data or data concerning health.

Thus, in application of the law of January 6, 1978 as amended (“information technology and freedoms” law), the processing of personal data for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health can be implemented provided that the data controller has made a declaration of conformity with a reference methodology. In the absence of compliance with a reference methodology, the processing must be the subject of an authorization request from the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (the CNIL).

The CNIL may approve and publish reference methodologies, under the standards mentioned in II of Article 66 of the “Informatique et Libertés” law, established in consultation with the Health Data Platform (PDS), as well as with public and private organizations representing the stakeholders concerned.

Among the most common processing of data from the National Health Data System (SNDS) are those carried out at the request of private organizations and more particularly of persons producing or marketing products mentioned in II of Article L. 5311- 1 (health products), of the public health code (CSP).

These treatments make it possible in particular to prepare discussion files with the competent authorities and committees mainly in the field of medicines and medical devices (marketing, pricing discussions, CE marking, etc.) and the carrying out of studies under conditions actual use.

In addition to that relating to data processing requiring access on behalf of persons producing or marketing products mentioned in II of Article L. 5311-1 of the CSP to data from the medicalization program of centralized information systems and made available on the secure platform of the Technical Agency for Information on Hospitalization, the Commission adopts a reference methodology relating to the processing of SNDS data necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller.

Data controllers who send a declaration of conformity to this reference methodology are authorized to implement their processing operations, as long as they meet the conditions provided for by the methodology and in particular have obtained an expressly favorable opinion from the Ethics Committee. and scientist for research, studies and evaluations in the field of health (CESREES).

the data controller undertakes to transmit every three years to the CNIL as well as to CESREES, a report summarizing the uses of the reference methodology, observed during this period. If they deem it relevant, the CNIL or CESREES may share this report with the CNAM and/or the PDS; the data controller must register each study carried out within the framework of the reference methodology in the public directory maintained by the PDS. . The method and the results obtained are published by the PDS at the end of the processing, according to the procedures provided for in paragraph 6.3: “Principle of transparency”.

1.3.2. This reference methodology is therefore not applicable to treatments:

hosted outside a controlled environment meeting the cumulative conditions mentioned above; requiring matching of SNDS data with personal data from other sources (for example: medical records); requiring reuse of updated data available as part of a previous study or from a health data warehouse containing SNDS data.

1.3.3. The processing operations mentioned in paragraph 1.3.2 can only be implemented after authorization from the CNIL.

1.4. Public interest and prohibited purposes

1.4.1. Processing carried out within the framework of this reference methodology must:
