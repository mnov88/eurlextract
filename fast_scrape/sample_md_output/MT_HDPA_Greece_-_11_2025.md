## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a gynecologist who was monitoring the data subject’s pregnancy during the period from September 2020 to October 2021.

In October 2021, the data subject had a miscarriage and informed the controller that she did not wish to continue their cooperation. At the same time, she requested a copy of her complete medical file that the controller was obliged to keep.

The controller handed over to the data subjects’ husband an incomplete medical file that did not include all the tests carried out during the monitoring of her pregnancy. The controller claimed that she did not keep a record of other data.

In June 2022, the data subject found out that the controller has been accessing her electronic medical record system after the termination of their cooperation.

The data subject filed a complained with the [Hellenic Data Protection Authority](/index.php?title=HDPA_\(Greece\) "HDPA (Greece)") (HDPA), claiming that:

a. The controller failed to fully satisfy her access request by providing her with the complete medical record, in order to conceal the evidence against her, or to conceal that she did not keep a complete medical record, and in order to prepare for a possible action against her for medical negligence,

b. although she did not have the status of attending physician and had not obtained the complainant's consent for this access to her health data, she repeatedly obtained improper access to her electronic medical record, obtaining medical information relating to the complainant's state of health in violation of [Article 9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#1 "Article 9 GDPR"), and

c. The controller unlawfully then transmitted that information to third parties.

The controller claimed that all examinations carried out during the data subject's pregnancy were already handed over during her visits to her office and the remaining tests that she kept in her file where handed over to her husband after her request. Regarding the access to her file, the controller claimed that she was informed that the data subject was pregnant again and wanted to recall what had happened in view of her possible new pregnancy in order to help her, even if she was no longer her treating doctor. Finally, the controller denied any transfer of the data subject’s data to third parties.

### Holding

First, the DPA found no violation of the data subject’s right of access (Article 15 GDPR). The controller failed to satisfy the data subject’s access request because she did not have at her disposal all the requested personal data of the data subject's medical file, except for the medical documents she handed over to her husband after her request, as well as the data she used to enter the electronic health system at the time when the right of access was exercised.

Second, the DPA held that the controller unlawfully processed the data subject’ personal data (social security number, full name, etc.) which she used to enter the electronic health system, as well as special category of personal data of [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") (health data) of the data subject, and therefore violated [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR").

Third, the DPA found that the evidence in the file do not show that the health data were in fact transmitted to third parties by the controller and rejected the claim as unfounded.

Lastly, taking into account [Article 83(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2 "Article 83 GDPR"), the DPA imposed a fine at the controller of the amount of €5,000.

## English Machine Translation of the Decision

The decision below is a machine translation of the Greek original. Please refer to the Greek original for more details.

Summary
The Authority examined a complaint against a private doctor specializing in gynecology, who was monitoring the pregnancy of the complainant, in which the latter complained about: a) non-full satisfaction of the right of access to her medical file, b) unlawful access to the complainant's personal electronic health file through the website https://ehealth.gov.gr, as well as c) unlawful transmission to third parties of personal health data concerning her.

The Authority found that the accused doctor, as the controller at the time the right of access was exercised, a) did not have at her disposal all the requested personal data of the complainant's medical file, except for the medical documents she handed over to her husband after the relevant request, as well as the data she used to enter the electronic health system (name, surname, social security number, etc.), rejecting the complainant's relevant claim, given that a crucial element for satisfying the right of access is the existence of the personal data at the time of exercising the right, b) the accused proceeded to unlawful processing of the complainant's data (social security number, full name, etc.), which she kept in her file, by registering them in the electronic health system and searching for information on the complainant's health status, thereby obtaining unfair, unethical and illegal access to the complainant's medical information, without the latter's knowledge and without being legitimized for this purpose, in violation of the principles of legality and objectivity of article 5 par. 1 a GDPR, and c) finally, there is no proof of the transfer of the complainant's health data to third parties.
