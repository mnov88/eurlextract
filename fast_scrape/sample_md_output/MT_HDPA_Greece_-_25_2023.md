## English Summary

### Facts

Piraeus Bank S.A., the controller, sent the data subject a letter informing them that it had entrusted the management of loans and credit related claims to a credit management company (AFS), its wholly owned subsidiary. The letter also informed that the data subject was subject to a claim and that their personal data had been shared with AFS, which was managing the claim.

The data subject submitted an access request to the controller under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"), asking for more detailed information such as the date, the means and the purpose of the transmission of their personal data, as well as the loan contract number and any other personal data.

The controller responded that the letter was sent to the data subject by mistake and asked them to disregard it as their personal data had not been shared and remained on its servers.

Dissatisfied with the response, the data subject filed a complaint with the Hellenic DPA, claiming that the controller did not provide them with sufficient information. Moreover, they argued that they did not have any loan or credit related claim with the controller and, therefore, there was no legal basis for sharing their data with AFS.

The DPA opened an investigation regarding the controller.

In the procedure, the controller stated that it had an agreement with AFS for the management of its 'portfolio' (receivables from loan granting and/or customers' debts that had became overdue, terminated or settled). The controller admitted that, due to a technical problem with its systems, letters were mistakenly sent to customers that had zero balance and should not be included in the portfolio.

### Holding

After the investigation, the Hellenic DPA could not determine if the data subject's data had been transferred to AFS, but reserved itself the right to further investigate the matter.

On the other hand, the DPA found that personal data from the data subject, as well as from a large number of customers who were involved in loans with zero rest were mistakenly included in a debtors list and received personalized letters. According to the DPA, the controller had no legal basis for this personal data processing and, therefore, violated [Articles 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

Furthermore, the DPA held that the controller did not implement sufficient organizational and technical measures to ensure that the processing of personal data meets the legal requirements, in breach of Article [25(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR "Article 25 GDPR").

Finally, the DPA stated that the response to the access request was incomplete as the controller merely informed the data subject that their data remained on its servers, but did not clarify about further processing operations that were being carried out. Thus, it concluded that the controller also violated Article [15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR").

For the above reasons, the Hellenic DPA issued a total fine of €210.000 and instruct (the controller) to satisfy the complainant's right of access.
