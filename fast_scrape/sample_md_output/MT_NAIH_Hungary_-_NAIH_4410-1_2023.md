The Hungarian DPA found that a solarium studio could not rely on legitimate interests under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") without carrying out a balancing of interests test. The DPA also held that the studio violated [Articles 13(1)(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") by only providing the information, on paper and upon request.

## English Summary

### Facts

A solarium studio in Hungary, the controller, had installed a CCTV system within its premises. Although the decision is not clear in this regard, an individual, the data subject, whose image had been recorded by such system, objected to the processing under Article 21 GDPR. Following a notification, the DPA initiated an _ex officio_ investigation with regard to the solarium studio’s video surveillance system.

The controller argued that it had a legal basis under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") for carrying out the camera surveillance on the premises in order to, _inter alia_, protect the property. However, despite the DPA’s multiple requests, the controller did not provide any balancing of interests test, nor did it make any statement to the authority of having such document.

Furthermore, in light of [Article 13(1)(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"), the controller claimed that there were printed privacy notices available at the front desk of studio. With regard to its employees, the controller claimed that it had provided information on the processing operations orally and within the job descriptions. However, the controller did not provide evidence to support its statements.

### Holding

The DPA emphasised that a controller is required to make a prior balancing test under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). However, the controller did not provide such assessment and the DPA concluded that the controller could not rely on a legitimate interest as a legal basis required under [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). Furthermore, the DPA noted that even if a balancing of interests had been carried out, the processing at stake could have not have been justified by legitimate interests.

In particular, the controller did not demonstrate the suitability of the cameras in question to the announced processing purpose (presumably, the protection of property), nor their proportionality. The DPA viewed that, in order to protect the property, other available solutions (e.g. lock, padlock, window bars, safe, alarm, motion detector, security guard, etc.) may in some cases provide more security than a camera-based data processing.

Since, according to the controller, the information on processing operations were only made available to the data subjects using the service on paper, on the spot, upon explicit request, the DPA found that no adequate information on the processing was available to the data subjects. Furthermore, the DPA noted that the controller had not demonstrated that the same information was provided to its employees.

As a result of the investigation, the DPA found that the controller infringed [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and [Article 13(1)(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). The controller was imposed with a fine of HUF 50,000 (approx. €130).

      acting within its competence, condemns the data manager or the data processor if

      its data management activities violated the provisions of this regulation.

III. Decision

(17) III.1. In the case of camera data management, the legitimate interest of the data controller is typically 1

      legal basis applied. The conceptual element of the legitimate interest is the discretion of the data controller
      obligation. The data controller is obliged to carry out a preliminary, written interest assessment test
      preparation in order to be able to refer to this legal basis. Legitimate interest is a legal basis
      it can be applied by the data controller if its application is based on the balancing of interests test
      is supported by its result (so the existence of the interest assessment test in itself does not

      sufficient). A test of interest balancing to identify different interests and those
      is built to balance. Within this framework, among other things, the
      the issue of necessity-proportionality and the reasonable expectations of those involved. These
      when considering it, it should be kept in mind that the interests of the stakeholders take precedence
      may enjoy against the interests of the data controller, and it should also be considered that it is

      at the start of data processing, can the data subjects reasonably expect that
      data controller manages their data for the given purpose.

1 GDPR Article 6 (1) point f): The processing of personal data is only lawful if and to the extent that at least
f) data processing is necessary to assert the legitimate interests of the data controller or a third party, unless these interests are involved
on the other hand, the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which are personal data, take precedence
their protection is necessary, especially if the child concerned is a child. Point f) of the first subparagraph does not apply to public authorities
for data management carried out by bodies in the performance of their duties.

                                              5(18) Despite repeated calls from the Authority, the Company does not carry out such an interest assessment test
      presented, so the legal basis of legitimate interest cannot legally be invoked.

(19) At the same time, the data management is carried out in the established way, the submission of a balance of interests test
      no legitimate interest could have been substantiated with a legal basis. Attached by the Company
      based on photos and floor plan, in the camera monitoring the entrance door from the outside section
      also observed public space. The worker and his workstation were under constant surveillance
      so that the angle of view of this camera partially extended to a reclining solarium.
      One of the internal cameras was partially or completely in the field of view of several of them

      tanning machine or the door leading to stationary tanning beds. The user of the service
      those involved could not get out of their way, and masking for the cameras was not
      was set.

(20) In relation to the cameras in question, the data management purpose - which is believed to be a
      it was asset protection - neither the ability to achieve it nor the proportionality was proven.
      Especially from an asset protection point of view, other available solutions (e.g. lock, padlock,

      window grill, safe, alarm, motion detector, security guard, etc.) is larger if applicable
      they can also mean security, like camera data management. Purpose of data management
      point of view, in the absence of a balance of interests test, it was not and is not supported
      it is likely that the camera system was one of the available solutions
      the most effective and, at the same time, the least burdensome solution for the privacy of those concerned.

(21) Since, based on the Company's statement, data management information is only available locally, on paper

      based on the express request of the parties using the service
      accessible, adequate information about data management was not available to them.
      The Company also does not provide the same information to employees
      verified; according to his statement, this was verbal information and included in the job description
      was realized by means of information, but his claims about this were not supported by evidence
      supported it.

(22) On the basis of the above, the Authority shall comply with Article 6 (1) of the GDPR and Article 13 (1) of the GDPR-
      (2) of the GDPR and Article 58 (2) point b) of the GDPR
      decided in accordance with the provisions of the ruling part (decision).

(23) At the same time, according to its statement, the Company abandoned the investigated data management, i.e
      dismantled devices on site.

(24) III.2. There was no clarification of the circumstances of data management in the investigation procedure
      possible, the Authority therefore decided to initiate the ex officio official procedure.
      Despite this, the Company's statements in the official procedure initiated ex officio
      were incomplete or delayed. Procedural fine against the Company
      was imposed in view of these antecedents, and thus the Authority is the authority
      in accordance with the provisions of section (order), for the waiver of the Company's procedural fine or

      decided to reject his request for mitigation.
