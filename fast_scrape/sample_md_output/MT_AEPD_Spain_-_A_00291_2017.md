## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject's curriculum vitae (CV) had been published on a public and open Facebook group without their consent. The CV included their home address, telephone number and e-mail address, among other personal information. The data subject stated that they were unaware of how the CV came into the hands of the person publishing it (the controller). Although it could have been obtained from websites, such as LinkedIn or Infojobs, their settings only allowed for recruiters to access it. Further, the data subject claimed that, based on a Google search, the controller was the administrator of several companies, therefore they could have used this position to access the CV. The data subject also indicated that the CV could also have been provided by a third party, with whom they had shared it a couple of years ago, when looking for a job.

The data subject submitted a complaint to the Spanish DPA indicating that the controller posted their resume in the same Facebook group several times and stating that they had contacted the Group Administrator and the controller who refused to remove the publication.

The controller presented several arguments in its defence. It claimed that the data subject's resume had been public at all times, considering its availability on portals, such as LinkedIn. Moreover, the controller submitted that the data subject was a public figure, therefore their professional activity was already available to the public. Allegedly, the CV also 'circulated publicly' since a trial involving the data subject. Finally, the controller argued that they were not actually responsible for removing the files, as it should be the task of the Facebook group administrator.

### Holding

First, the Spanish DPA recalled that data which may appear on a website, according to [Article 3(j) of the LOPD](http://www.iee.es/pages/bases/articulos/proda003.html), are not considered sources accessible to the public. The fact that the controller provided a copy of said resume in a public trial did not convert said document into a source of public access.

Second, even if it was true that the data subject physically distributed their resume to other people, it did not authorise the controller to disseminate it on Facebook forums or expose it repeatedly. The DPA confirmed that the controller did not collect consent within the meaning of [Article 6(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") for said dissemination.

Third, the DPA noted that freedom of expression must be differentiated from the violation of the fundamental right to data protection. Such a violation occured when uploading a CV not related to the activity of the controller in order to maintain informal contacts on a Facebook group.

Fourth, regarding the allegation that the data subject was a person of public relevance, it was proven that they did not hold any public office. Rather, they have performed actions related to political training. Hence, there was no authorisation for the exhibition of the CV on Facebook without the data subject's consent on repeated occasions.

Firth, the DPA stated that the controller was responsible for uploading the data subject's CV to Facebook on several occasions and as such, violated [Article 10 of the LOPD](https://bittemple.es/legislacion/lopd-151999/titulo-ii-principios-proteccion-datos/lopd-articulo-10-deber-de-secreto/) relating to professional secrecy.

In conclusion, the Spanish DPA considered this violation as serious and ordered the controller to remove the file containing the data subject's CV from the Facebook group.

## Comment

**There are two important points that can be extracted from this decision:**

**1.** The definition of public sources as per Article 3(j) of the Spanish Data Protection law

"Sources accessible to the public: those files whose consultation can be carried out by any person, not prevented by a limiting rule or without further requirement than, where appropriate, the payment of a consideration.

They are exclusively considered public access sources, the promotional census, the telephone directories in the terms provided by their specific regulations and the lists of people belonging to groups of professionals that contain only the data of name, title, profession, activity, academic degree, address and indication of their membership in the group. Likewise, official newspapers and bulletins and the media have the character of public access sources."

Thus, the AEDP stated that social media websites can't be considered a public source.

**2.** A person that publishes someone else's personal data on social media pages without their consent is considered responsible of the treatment and as such is subject to being fined under GDPR and Spanish Data Protection law.

       The data that may appear on a website, according to this definition,

sources accessible to the public are not considered.

       On the other hand, if it is true that the complainant physically distributed his
curriculum to other people, this does not authorize the accused to expose it in forums of
FACEBOOK or expose it repeatedly, because the medium used and its
results, also stating that you do not have the consent of the referred for said
exposition.

       The right to data protection, according to one of the judgments of the

Constitutional Court that configures it, STC 292/2000, states that "... the content
of the fundamental right to data protection consists of a power of disposal and
control over personal data that empowers the person to decide which of their

data protection that occurs when uploading the curriculum that is not related to
the chats that the accused maintains in an informal tone with other users. For him
The aforementioned right is not necessary nor does it appear related to attaching said document,
also taking into account that the complainant does not participate in any way in said
groups.

       Article 6.1 LOPD provides that "The processing of personal data
personnel will require the unequivocal consent of the affected party, unless the Law
provide something else."

       This principle entails the need for the unequivocal consent of the

affected so that your personal data can be processed, the consent
This allows the affected party to exercise control over their personal data (the
informative self-determination), since it is the interested party who has to grant
your consent so that the aforementioned data can be processed.

       This is a fundamental guarantee that is only found as exceptions to

that consent of the affected party, those established in a law, collected in the
section 2 of the aforementioned article 6 LOPD a series of exceptions to the provision of
said consent.

       The respondent is responsible for the treatment carried out with the
résumé of the complainant that in pdf format or in photography has been uploaded in several

occasions to FACEBOOK. Nothing is indicated as a file or has anything to do with the
Administrator or creator of a group. The truth is that the defendant inserts
again, even if the Administrator deletes the whistleblower's resume file.

Provincial Court of Asturias (Section 7) no. 20/2017 of 01/19, resource of

Appeal 526/2016 determines those responsible for the facts, in this case presenting a
sentence with data from another on FACEBOOK as illegitimate interference with honor,
indicating "The Judgment issued in the preceding instance, substantially estimates the
lawsuit filed by F.F.F. in front of D.ª G.G.G., declaring that the publications
made by the latter on July 29 and 30, 2015 on its Facebook account
entail an intrusion into the right to honor of the plaintiffs and condemns the

the right of cancellation before the Administrator, and the accused would know this
claim of the complainant since the conversation of the
denounced with the Administrator of a Group with the result of the refusal to withdraw

the curriculum, also stating that he presented it again. On the other hand, the
Group administrator does not have the pdf file that has been posted over and over again or
uploaded to that page. Said action has been carried out by the accused. The
Admin can delete comments or files, but if these are re-inserted
no effect arises. The Administrator is not responsible for what each user

manifests or hangs, which in this case is proven to have its origin in the
denounced. The Administrator may have created the Group, but the use of the
platform does not make you responsible for files. Moreover, in the present
of course, the accused is imputed as responsible for the treatment considered this
in article 3.c) of the LOPD as “operations and technical procedures of
automated character or not, that allow the collection, recording, conservation,

elaboration, modification, blocking and cancellation, as well as the transfers of data that
resulting from communications, consultations, interconnections and transfers.”

       The Court of Justice of the European Union, in the judgment of 6/11/2003 (case
Lindqvist. Case C-101/01) addressed the issue we are dealing with, pointing out

Next:

"The concept of "personal data" used in article 3, paragraph 1, of the
Directive 95/46 comprises, according to the definition contained in article 2, letter
a), of said Directive «all information about a natural person identified or
identifiable”. This concept includes, without a doubt, the name of a person next to his

telephone number or other information regarding your working conditions or your
hobbies

As regards the concept of "processing" of such data used in Article 3,
paragraph 1 of Directive 95/46, this includes, according to the definition of the
Article 2, letter b, of said Directive, "any operation or set of operations,

carried out or not through automated procedures, and applied to data
personal”. This last provision lists several examples of such operations,
including communication by transmission, broadcast or any other form
that facilitates access to data. It follows that conduct consisting of
referencing, on a web page, personal data should be considered a
treatment of this kind.

It remains to be determined whether such processing is 'partially or fully automated'. A
In this regard, it should be noted that disseminating information on a web page implies,
in accordance with the technical and computer procedures that are applied
currently, publish said page on a server, as well as perform the operations
necessary to make it accessible to people who are connected to the Internet.

These operations are carried out, at least in part, in an automated manner.

Therefore, it is appropriate to answer the first question that the conduct that consists in
make reference, on a web page, to various people and to identify them by their
name or by other means, such as your telephone number or information regarding your

working conditions and hobbies, constitutes a "total treatment or
partially automated personal data" within the meaning of Article 3, paragraph
1, of Directive 95/46. "

28001 – Madrid 6 sedeagpd.gob.es 7/10

       The sentence does not distinguish whether the web page is its own or that of another person, but in
In this case, it is accredited that the information containing the data has been exposed
on several occasions by the defendant, then has carried out as many treatments as

occasions this curriculum has been uploaded.
       Regarding the allegation that the complainant is a person with relevant

public, it is accredited that he does not hold any public office understood as elected by
citizenship, even if they have carried out actions related to a
police training. Although he is a person of public relevance, he does not exist
authorization for the exhibition of the curriculum without your consent in repeated
occasions on FACEBOOK.

       Therefore, the commission of the infraction of article 6.1 by the accused is accredited.

       The infraction committed by the accused appears typified as serious in the
article 44.3.b) of the LOPD, which considers as such, "Treat personal data
personnel without obtaining the consent of the affected persons, when the same
necessary in accordance with the provisions of this Law and its development provisions.

                                           III

       Don A.A.A. by exposing, without the consent of the complainant on FACEBOOK the
complainant's CV without limitations, has incurred in the violation of article 10
of the LOPD that indicates:

       “The person responsible for the file and those who intervene in any phase of the
processing of personal data are bound by professional secrecy

regarding them and the duty to safeguard them, obligations that will subsist even
after ending their relations with the owner of the file or, where appropriate, with the
responsible for it."

       Said infraction is typified in article 44.3.d) of the LOPD that

qualifies as serious "The violation of the duty to keep secret about the
processing of personal data referred to in article 10 of the
this Law”.

       It is not proven in this case that the position of the defendant

be responsible for the file that should store the complainant's data. Either
that held any legal position related to it to be required the
data secrecy duty

       Thus, this infraction imputed to the accused is archived.

                                               IV

       Section 6 of article 45 of the LOPD establishes the following:

       “Exceptionally, the sanctioning body may, after hearing the
interested parties and having regard to the nature of the facts and the significant concurrence of
the criteria established in the previous section, not agreeing to open the

28001 – Madrid 6 sedeagpd.gob.es 8/10

sanctioning procedure, and instead, warn the responsible subject so that,
within the term that the sanctioning body determines, proves the adoption of the measures
corrections that in each case are pertinent, provided that the
following budgets:

       a) That the facts constituted a minor or serious infraction in accordance with
           the provisions of this Law.
       b) That the offender had not been previously sanctioned or warned.

       If the warning is not addressed within the period that the sanctioning body
determined, the opening of the corresponding procedure will proceed

sanction for said non-compliance.

       In this regard, it is appropriate to consider the provisions of article 45.4 and 5 of the
LOPD, which establishes the following:

"4. The amount of the sanctions will be graduated according to the following criteria:

       a) The continuing nature of the offence.
       b) The volume of treatments carried out.
       c) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatments
           of personal data.

       d) The volume of business or activity of the offender.
       e) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the
           infringement.
       f) The degree of intentionality.
       g) Recidivism due to commission of infractions of the same nature.
       h) The nature of the damages caused to the interested persons or to

third persons.
       i) Proof that prior to the events constituting the
infringement, the accused entity had adequate procedures in place for
action in the collection and treatment of IOS personal data, being the
infraction as a result of an anomaly in the operation of said
procedures not due to a lack of diligence required of the offender.

       j) Any other circumstance that is relevant to determine the degree of
illegality and culpability present in the specific infringing action.

       5. The sanctioning body will establish the amount of the sanction applying the
scale relative to the class of offenses immediately preceding in severity
that in which the one considered in the case in question is integrated, in the following

assumptions:

       a) When there is a qualified decrease in the guilt of the
           accused or of the unlawfulness of the act as a consequence of the
           significant concurrence of several of the criteria set forth in the

           section 4 of this article.
       b) When the infringing entity has regularized the irregular situation of
           diligent way.
       c) When it can be seen that the behavior of the affected party has been able to induce
           the commission of the offence.

28001 – Madrid 6 sedeagpd.gob.es 9/10

       d) When the offender has spontaneously admitted his guilt.
       e) When a merger process by absorption has taken place and the
           infraction was prior to said process, not being attributable to the entity

           absorbent".

       In this case, the requirements set forth in sections
a) and b) of the aforementioned article 45.6 of the LOPD. Along with this, there is a qualified
decrease in the guilt of the defendant due to the concurrence of several criteria of
those set forth in article 45.4 of the LOPD (article 45.5.a LOPD), specifically:

               The volume of treatments carried out.
               Absence of recidivism, not having been sanctioned previously
               for the commission of infractions of the same nature.
               There are no records of damage caused to the interested party or to third parties

               persons, except those arising from the offense committed.
               The lack of connection between the offender's activity and the performance of
               processing of personal data.
