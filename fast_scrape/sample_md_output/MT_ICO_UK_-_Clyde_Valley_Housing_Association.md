## English Summary

### Facts

Clyde Valley Housing Association was established in 1996 and provides social housing to the Lanarkshire and East Dunbartonshire areas of Scotland. It is a registered charity that owns and manages around 4,700 properties and provides services to 3,000 homeowners.

Clyde Valley Housing Association released a new customer portal. The portal went live on 14 July 2022. On the same date, a resident logged into the portal and found that they were able to view personal information about other residents. The resident called Clyde Valley Housing Association and spoke to a customer service advisor, and told them that they could see information that they felt they shouldn’t have been able to see. The customer service advisor who received the call then failed to escalate this concern, which led to this data remaining viewable on the portal for a further 5 days until further residents reported the issue and Clyde Valley Housing Association suspended the portal.

### Holding

Following an investigation, the Commissioner issued a reprimand to Clyde Valley Housing Association in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), having determined that Clyde Valley Housing Association failed to carry out adequate testing prior to the online customer portal going live, leading to accidental access of personal information due to a lack of appropriate technical measures. This demonstrated a failure to keep residents data secure against unauthorised processing, and as a result was an infringement of Article 5(1)(f) of the UK GDPR.

The decision to issue an reprimand was taken after considering the remedial steps taken by Clyde Valley Housing Association and the portal development company. The Commissioner also recommended that Clyde Valley Housing Association should consider taking certain steps to improve its compliance and ensure staff are appropriately trained to deal with data protection matters.
