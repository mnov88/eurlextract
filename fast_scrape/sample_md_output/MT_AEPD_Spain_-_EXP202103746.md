The DPA held that there was no violation of [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR") because the installed surveillance cameras were oriented towards the controller's private property. Also, there was no evidence of unjustified infringement of public space.

## English Summary

### Facts

A complaint is filed against the controller for having six surveillance cameras facing public highway and private spaces without authorisation. In addition to the claim, there is also documentary evidence provided, proving the presence of the surveillance devices.

### Holding

In this case the DPA, stated that private individuals are responsible for ensuring that systems installed comply with current legislation. Also, that installations of this type of device must be accompanied by mandatory informative signs. The DPA held that there is no violation of data minimisation, [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"). No fines can be imposed against the controller and [Article 83(5) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR") can therefore not be imposed. This is because there is no evidence of any infringement of the rights of third parties or the taking of public space.

## Comment

The rest of the conflicts in this case do not fall within the competence of this body and should be settled in appropriate judicial instances.

Article 5.1.c) of the RGPD provides that personal data will be “adequate, pertinent,
limited and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed

personal character.

Article 22.4 of the LOPDGDD provides that:

       “The duty of information provided for in article 12 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 will be understood to be fulfilled by placing an informative device

in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment,
the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights provided for in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the

informative device a connection code or internet address to this information”.

In any case, the cameras must be oriented towards the particular space, avoiding
intimidate neighboring neighbors with this type of device, as well as control areas

transit of the same without just cause.

Nor can images of public spaces be obtained with this type of device,
as this is the exclusive competence of the State Security Forces and Bodies.

It should be remembered that even in the case of a "simulated" camera, the same
should preferably be oriented towards private space, since it is considered
that this type of device can affect the privacy of third parties, that they are inti-

measured by it in the belief of being the subject of permanent recording.

On the part of individuals, it is not possible to install imaging devices
of public space, outside the cases allowed in the regulations.

       The evidence provided by the respondent confirms the presence of the
cameras, although they are duly marked and are oriented exclusively to their

thor. Applying the principle "in dubio pro reo" in case of doubt regarding a fact
concrete and determined, which obliges in any case to resolve said doubt in the most
favorable to the interested party.

The presumption of innocence must govern without exceptions in the legal system
sanctioning and must be respected in the imposition of any sanctions, since
the exercise of the ius puniendi in its diverse manifestations is conditioned to the

game of evidence and a contradictory procedure in which they can defend themselves
own positions. In this sense, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment

76/1990, of 04/26, considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails:
"that the sanction is based on acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating
of the reproached conduct; that the burden of proof corresponds to the one who accuses, without

that no one is obliged to prove his own innocence; and that any insufficiency in
the result of the tests carried out, freely assessed by the
sanctioning, must be translated into an acquittal pronouncement.

The presumption of innocence governs without exceptions in the sanctioning system and has
to be respected in the imposition of any sanction, whether criminal or administrative
(TCo 13/1981), since the exercise of the sanctioning right in any of its

manifestations, is conditioned to the test game and to a procedure
contradictory environment in which their own positions can be defended.

Pursuant to this principle, no penalty may be imposed on the basis of the

guilt of the accused if there is no activity to prove the charge, which in the
appreciation of the authorities or bodies called to resolve, destroy this
presumption (TCo Auto 3-12-81).
