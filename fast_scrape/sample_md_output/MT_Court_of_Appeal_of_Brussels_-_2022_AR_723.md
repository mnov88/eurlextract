## English Summary

### Facts

This ruling of the Belgian court of appeal (Marktenhof) concerns the Belgian Railway company SNCB/NMBS (controller), a company with the Belgian state as its only shareholder. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the controller was ordered by the Belgian government to start an initiative to promote train travel. On 13 October 2020, the controller emailed railway pass holders to inform them about the use cases of this travel pass and also provided COVID-19 related information. This e-mail resulted in GDPR related discussions on Twitter, specifically regarding the lack of the possibility to object. The Belgian DPA started an investigation on that matter and found that by not providing the possibility to opt-out of receiving similar emails, the controller violated [Articles 12(2)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR"), [21(2)](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#2 "Article 21 GDPR") and [21(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#4 "Article 21 GDPR"). Moreover, the DPA held that the controller violated [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [5(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), [5(2)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"), [6(1)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"), [12(2)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#2 "Article 12 GDPR"), [21(2)](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#2 "Article 21 GDPR") and [21(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#4 "Article 21 GDPR").

The controller was fined €10,000 (a summary of this decision is available on the [hub](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=APD/GBA_\(Belgium\)_-_71/2022)) and decided to appeal the decision with the Appeal Court on the following grounds: _First_, the controller contested the applicability of the GDPR, considering that the e-privacy directive was applicable as _lex specialis._ _Second,_ the controller stated Article 6 ECFR had been breached because it had not been able to comment on a piece of evidence. _Third_, the controller stated that the decision of the DPA was based on an inaccurate and incomplete representation of the facts. Among the others, the controller disputed the DPA’s definition of ‘Direct marketing’. It added that it had sent the e-mail in the first place because it was obligated to do so pursuant to the government's instruction. It had to provide COVID-19 related information and promote its full service as part of its public service obligation. _Fourth_, the controller argued that the DPA did not properly motivate the GDPR violations in the disputed decision. _Fifth,_ the controller disputed the DPA's application of the national implementation of [article 83(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#7 "Article 83 GDPR") which enables the DPA to fine a public entity controller under certain conditions. _Sixth,_ the controller stated that the DPA did not properly motivate its fine.

### Holding

_First_, the court held that both the GDPR and the e-privacy directive were applicable in this case. The court stated that Article 13(2) of the e-privacy directive, which covers the conditions for direct marketing, explicitly mentions that the GDPR should also be respected.

_Second_, the court determined that there was indeed a piece of evidence on which the controller was not able to comment but it was not the main piece of evidence on which the DPA’s decision was based.

_Third,_ the court held that since the e-mail also included a hyperlink linking to promotional content, it was a form of direct marketing. The court also agreed with the DPA that promotional material for a government service can constitute direct marketing.

_Fourth_, the court held that the DPA properly motivated the violations in the original decision.

_Fifth,_ the court rejected the controller’s argument regarding [Article 83(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#7 "Article 83 GDPR"), considering that the controller did not limit itself to its legal obligation by only providing the railway pass and sanitary information regarding COVID-19. Therefore, [Article 83(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#7 "Article 83 GDPR") was not applicable for the controller.

_Sixth,_ the court held that the DPA did not adequately consider the circumstances brought forward by the controller that could impact the amount of the fine. The court also considered several circumstances on its own initiative, namely that the communication had the main goal of providing safety from COVID-19 infections and the fact that the controller had been obligated by law to issue the travel pass.

In conclusion, following point 6 of the appeal above, the court concluded that the fine was improperly motivated, not proportional and reduced it to a symbolic €1,00. It rejected all the other grounds for the appeal and therefore confirmed the original decision on the other grounds.
