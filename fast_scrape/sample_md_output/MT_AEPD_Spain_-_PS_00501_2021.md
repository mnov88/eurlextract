## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against Vodafone España S.A.U. (Vodafone) claiming that someone had contracted two prepaid phone numbers fraudulently in their name through one of Vodafone's distributors.

The data subjected had originally filed a police report for identity theft used to contract these phone lines, and also made an access request to Vodafone to obtain further information on the contracting of these phone lines.

Vodafone responded to this request stating that they only had partial information on file for the contracting of one of the two phone lines in the data subject's name. The data on file included the data subject's ID number, postal address, but no signature.

### Holding

The AEPD held that according to the evidence in the case, Vodafone had violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") for unlawful processing of the data without a proven justification to do so.

Additionally, the AEPD held that Vodafone had acted with a lack of diligence to comply with the principle of accountability under [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"), as it did not possess adequate documentation of the contracting of the phone lines to prove the processing was lawful.

The AEPD set the fine at €70,000eur. The payment was reduced €56,000 as Vodafone adhered to the provision which establishes a 20% reduction for voluntary payment, although not explicitly accepting responsibility for the infringement.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate

and to solve this procedure.

                                              II

      The General Data Protection Regulation deals in article 5 with the
principles that must govern the processing of personal data and mentions among
them that of "legality, loyalty and transparency". The provision provides:

      "one. The personal data will be:

         a) Treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner with the interested party;”

## Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the

assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

      "one. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
terms:

      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;

      b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
      interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
      pre-contractual;

      (…)”

      The violation of article 6.1 of the RGPD is typified in article 83
of the RGPD that, under the heading “General conditions for the imposition of fines
administrative”, says:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 5/12

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

      The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72.1.b) qualifies this infraction, for the purposes
of prescription, as a very serious infraction.

      The documentation in the file offers evidence that the party
claimed violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it processed the personal data
of the claimant (name, surnames and D.N.I.), without having legitimacy for the treatment
of the claimant's data.

      It should be remembered that article 5 of the RGPD, after alluding in its section

1 to the principles relating to the processing of personal data -among them, as
has pointed out in the preceding Basis, that of "legality"-, it says in its section 2:

      “The person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the
provided in section 1 and able to demonstrate it (<<proactive responsibility>>)”

        Well, with respect to the facts that are the subject of this claim,
We must point out that Vodafone does not have documentation proving the
contracting the prepaid lines \*\*\*TELEPHONE.1 and \*\*\*TELEPHONE.2 in the name of the
claimant.

      The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
obligations imposed by the personal data protection regulations

it is therefore evident. Diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
of third-party data requires that the data controller be in a position
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

      In short, there is evidence in the file that the respondent tried
the personal data of the claimant without legitimacy to do so. The behavior described

violates article 6.1. of the RGPD and is subsumable in the sanctioning type of the article
83.5.a, of the RGPD.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 6/12

                                                III

      In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the precautions
visions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that indicate:

      “Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

administrative actions under this article for violations of this
Regulation indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”

      “Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the

Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

        a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
        nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
        as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
        damages they have suffered;

        b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

        c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
        to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;

        d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the
        treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
        applied under articles 25 and 32;

        e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the

        treatment;

         f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
        remedying the breach and mitigating the possible adverse effects of the breach;

        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

        h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such

        case, to what extent;

        i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
        previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in question
        in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;

        j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms
        certificates approved in accordance with article 42, and

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the

        case, such as financial benefits realized or losses avoided, direct
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 7/12

        or indirectly, through infringement.”

      Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
“Sanctions and corrective measures”, provides:

      "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

may also be taken into account:

        a) The continuing nature of the offence.

        b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatments
of personal data.

        c) The profits obtained as a result of committing the offence.

        d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have induced the
commission of the offence.

        e) The existence of a merger by absorption process after the commission

of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.

        f) Affectation of the rights of minors.

        g) Have, when it is not mandatory, a delegate for the protection of
data.

        h) The submission by the person in charge or person in charge, with
voluntary, to alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those
assumptions in which there are controversies between those and any interested party.”

      In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the

instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction of fine to
impose on the claimed entity as responsible for an infraction typified in the
article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, in an initial assessment, they are estimated to be concurrent in the
present case the following factors:

As aggravating factors:

- The intentionality or negligence of the infringement (article 83.2.b, RGPD). Dice
        that the respondent party does not have documentation proving the
        contracting the prepaid lines \*\*\*TELEPHONE.1 and \*\*\*TELEPHONE.2 to

claimant's name.

 - The evident link between the business activity of the defendant and the
      processing of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the

      RGPD in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD)

        It is appropriate to graduate the sanctions to be imposed on the claimed party and set them in the amount
of €70,000 for the infringement of article 83.5 a) RGPD and 72.1b) of the LOPDGDD.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 8/12

Spanish Data Protection Agency.
