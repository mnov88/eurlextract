The Spanish DPA issued a €1,500 fine to an individual property owner for a violation of [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR") by placing security cameras in a position which also captured the private area of a neighbour's house.

## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a claim with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) in which they state that their neighbour has installed security cameras which are facing their home and are an unjustified infringement on their privacy. The AEPD received no response or clarification regarding the cameras from the defendant.

The AEPD requested Security Forces and Corps to carry out an inspection on the neighbour's property, which confirmed that there cameras facing outwards with a notice sign stating the name of the company which installed the cameras, but did not specify who was responsible for the processing of the data collected.

### Holding

The AEPD stated that security cameras must not be positioned in a way that they record adjacent public spaces or the private areas of others. The AEPD held that since the entrance to the claimant's house (as well as part of the public street adjacent to it) appeared to be within the scope of the security cameras, it could be presumed that it was collecting the claimant's personal data. According to the AEPD, this constitutes a violation of [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR") because it negatively affected the rights of the claimant without a justified cause.

Additionally, the AEPD held that if a security camera is directed at any space outside of private property, the camera must have a notice sign which complies with GDPR, stating the exact area being recorded, and who is responsible for the processing.

Consequently, the AEPD issued a €1,500 fine to the owner of the security camera for violating [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), and also ordered the owner of the cameras to provide proof within one month of the lawfulness of the contents of the captured recordings (including screenshots with time stamps), as well as proof that they have placed a GDPR compliant notice sign (including a specification of the area recorded and who is responsible for the processing).

that the front camera captures space close to the adjacent road, being surrounded
