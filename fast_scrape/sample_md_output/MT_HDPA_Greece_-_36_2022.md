The Greek DPA fined a medical diagnostics centre €30,000 for violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality by losing images of a data subject's mammogram due to insufficient technical and organisational measures. The DPA reprimanded the diagnostics centre for the data breach and ordered it to communicate the breach to the affected data subjects.

## English Summary

### Facts

A patient (data subject) of diagnostic centre Pyle Axiou I.A.E. (controller) requested copies of her medical records in relation to a mammogram carried out in the past. The controller replied that it could not provide her with the images from the mammogram, as the machine can only store them for 3 months. The data subject then submitted a complaint with the DPA for violation of her right of access. She stressed that in particular the images of the mammogram were important in view of her age and state of health.

After a letter of the DPA, the controller suddenly remembered that it also stored the images on a hard drive in it's storage. However, it could not recover the images.

During a hearing, the controller argued:

1.  it exhausted all possibilities to recover the images (but without success);
2.  the most important medical record was provided to the data subject: the report on the images.
3.  it informed the data subject in good time of the unavailability of the images;
4.  it submitted his views on the issues of his compliance with his obligations under Articles 32-34 GDPR.

The data subject argued during the hearing that, in addition to the violation of the right of access, the controller also violated her right to information. She was never informed by the controller of the definitive loss of the images.

### Holding

The DPA found that the retention period for the images was ten years from the data subject's last visit. The DPA further noted that the images were unavailable at the time the right was exercised. The DPA therefore held that the data subject's right of access ([Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR")) was not violated as it was impossible to provide the images, even though they were unlawfully deleted.

However, the DPA, found that the loss of availability of the images constituted a violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality pursuant to [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR"). The DPA followed that the above-mentioned violation was a result of insufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure the appropriate level of security pursuant to [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

The DPA imposed an administrative fine on the controller,

The DPA further reprimanded to controller, as it notified the DPA too late about the data breach in violation of the [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"). The DPA also ordered the controller to communicate the data breach to the affected data subjects pursuant to [Article 34 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR "Article 34 GDPR").

The Authority took into account the following:
With the from 31.05.2021 (and with no. prot. APD C/EIS/3559/31.05.2021)
complaint A informed the Authority that she submitted a PRIVATE complaint to the diagnostic center
Polyclinic and diagnostic center Pylis Axios I.A.E. from 08.02.2021
request, with which he asked to receive copies of the illustrations that
are included in the medical file of the Center and related to the digital
mammogram carried out on ...01.2018, in addition to its conclusion. The
Center with its reply from 09.02.2021 informed A that: "there is no
ability to reprint images from the machine you made the
examination in January 2018. The particular machine had the ability
3 months file storage and that's why we replaced it
of". Following this, A complained to the Authority that the right was violated
access to personal data concerning her, and
2 specifically, that she was not given copies of the imaging tests

in addition, that this is an important gynecological examination, which
serves, due to age and health status, as a reference test.

date of their processing and at the same time they were stored on hard systems
discs, which were stored in a warehouse within the diagnostic center.
We searched for the hard drive system where the image is stored
of the complainant's digital mammogram and we identified it. It's about
a NAS hard drive system, which contains images from axial drives
CT scans, MRI scans, mammograms and X-rays, which
have taken place during the period from March 2017 to
March 2018 at our diagnostic center (...)". In addition, the diagnostic center
informed the Authority that it has approached the companies Northwind Data Recovery and
3 Stellar in order, as it claims, to exhaust all the possibilities that
offers the technology to recover the files contained in the
company's hard drive system in the best possible form and quality.
