## English Summary

### Facts

A former employee of IAMSAT Muntenia SA exercised their right to object under [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") by requesting the company to stop processing their personal data, since their contractual relationship had ended. The company, however, did not answer or grant this request, prompting the data subject file to file a complaint with the Romanian DPA.

During the investigation, besides the facts concerning the data subject's right to object, the authority also found out that the company was conducting video surveillance at its workplace.

### Holding

The Romanian DPA held that the company had violated [Articles 12(3)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR") and [21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR") by not handling the data subject's request to exercise their right to object. It also held that the company had not adequately informed its employees on the processing of their personal data through video surveillance at the workplace, in breach of [Articles 12](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

For the former violations, the DPA issued a fine of approximately €1000 (RON 4.946,2) on the company, and for the latter, a fine of approximately €2000 (RON 9.892,4). Additionally, as corrective measures, the DPA ordered the company to inform its employees about its data processing activities conducted through video surveillance in its workplace, as well as to reply and resolve the data subject's objection request accordingly.
