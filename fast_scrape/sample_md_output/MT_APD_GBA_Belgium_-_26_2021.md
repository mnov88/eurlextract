                                        Interim decision 26/2021 of 23 February 2021

File no. : DOS-2019-01377

Subject: Language of the procedure - complaint against IAB Europe

Chairman, and Messrs. Yves Poullet and Christophe Boeraeve, members, will take these in that composition

case in progress;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016

on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of

personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive

Having regard to the rules of internal procedure, as approved by the Chamber of

Representatives of the people on December 20, 2018 and published in the Belgian Official Gazette on 15

Having regard to the hearing before the Marktenhof on February 3, 2021,

In view of the judgment of the Marktenhof of 17 February 2021. Decision 26/2021 - 2/4

1 has taken the following decision regarding:

    - the complainants:

             - Mr. Johnny Ryan

             - Mr Pierre Dewitte

             - Mr. Jeff Ausloos

             - Mr Bruno Bidon

             - NGO Panoptykon

             - La Ligue des Droits de l'Homme

    - the defendant: IAB Europe

    1. Justification

2 1. Pursuant to the agreement concluded between the parties, as ratified by the Marktenhof

    in its judgment 2020/1351 of 17 February 2021, this interim decision amends the interim decision

    No. 01/2021 of January 8, 2021 as follows.

2. The GBA changes the language of the case from French to Dutch. This means that the correspondence

    of the GBA will from now on be conducted in Dutch with the parties and that in the future

    provisional and final decisions of the Disputes Chamber will be in Dutch. The

    However, the Disputes Chamber will provide a French and an English translation of the final decision to the

    provide parties.

3. On 4 February 2021, the DPA also provided the parties with the inspection report of 13 July 2020

    decision in French, sanitized from English wording. There are no substantive

    made changes to the report. This new French version of the inspection report

    replaces the previous version ex tunc. This implies that IAB Europe commits itself to nullity

    of the Inspectorate's report on the basis of the language legislation.

    language provided on 11 February 2021.

    decisions of the Disputes Chamber, as well as on the specific nature and public interest

    of this decision, it will be published on the website of the

    Data protection authority. In view of the previous publicity on this case, the

    Litigation chamber decided the direct identification of the parties and the cited

    persons, natural or legal persons.

8. The aforementioned agreement between the parties is attached to this decision and on the website

    of the Data Protection Authority.
