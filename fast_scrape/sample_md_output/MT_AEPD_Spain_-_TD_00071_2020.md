## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of an investigation procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that he/she had requested his/her right to be forgotten in relation to nine (9) URLs, but this right was not approved by the defendant.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests stating that one (1) of the URLs had been duly erased, and during this procedure, another two (2) URLs were also erased, but it declared that the other six (6) had not been approved as they were referring to the professional life of the Spanish citizen, and not to his/her personal life. The defendant also added that such not-erased-information was related to the activity of the claimant as candidate for different public jobs, so erasing it would not be compliant with the legitimate public interests.

### Holding

After obtaining the corresponding evidences, the AEPD understood that, as long as the not-erased-URLs are related to professional and not personal information of the claimant (and that CJEU judgement 13/05/14 clarified that the right to be forgotten can be declined due to the role of the claimant in the public life), they are excluded from the data protection regulation as per Articles 1 and 2 of the GPDR. In this sense, the AEPD decided to dismiss the claim from the Spanish citizen.

Furthermore, the effect ofinterference in said rights of the interested party is multiplied due to the important roleplayed by the Internet and search engines in modern society, whichmake the information contained in such a hit list ubiquitous (see,in this sense, the judgment eDate Advertisin et al., C-509/09 and C-161/10,EU: C2011: 685, paragraph 45).(…) To respect the rights established by these provisions, provided thatactually meet the requirements established in them, the manager of asearch is obliged to remove from the list of results obtained after asearch made from a person's name links to web pages,published by third parties and that contain information related to this person, alsoin the event that this name or this information is not deleted prior orsimultaneously of this web pages, and, where appropriate, although the publication in saidpages is in itself lawful. "Consequently, the processing of personal data carried out by theThe manager of a search engine allows a list of search engines to be obtained from a "name".results that provide information about a person that may affect their scopeprivate. Once the interested party has submitted their request to delete theirpersonal data before the search engine, you must examine it and proceed, in yourcase, to the deletion of specific links from the list of results, without prior orsimultaneously you have to go to the person in charge of the website.QINTO: In the present case, the complaining party exercised the right before the complainedin relation to the URLs already referenced.The origin or not of attending, in the present case, therequest that, after a search carried out, your name is not linked tocertain results.On the part of this Agency it has been verified that, when conducting a searchby the name of the complaining party in the Google search engine, URLs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 9 do notresults were obtained and the name of the person concerned does not appear in URL 4.In relation to URLs 6, 7 and 8, it has been verified that personal datapublished, are related to your professional activity. At URL 6, post adocument on some selective tests of the year 2017. URL 7, deals with apublication in the BORME of 2014, on "Registered acts" of entrepreneurs. URL 8,It is about a publication of a City Council in 2017, of an employment exchange.Therefore, these three URLs pour information related to the activityprofessional of this and in accordance with art. 1.1 and 2 of the RGPD, would be excluded from theright to data protection.C / Jorge Juan 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es

6/7Furthermore, entering into the weighting of the interests at stake,The information provided in said URLs refers to the professional life of the partyclaimant, and not personal life, as this is very relevant to assess theprotection of the right regulated in art. 18 of our Magna CartaThere is a distinction between private life and public or professional life of aperson, therefore, the availability of information in a search resultRegarding the professional or public activity of a person, thede-indexing of the content if it is related to the working life of the interested party,taking into account the nature of the work and the legitimate interest of the public in havingaccess to information through a search by name.The judgment of the CJEU of May 13, 2014 on the right to be forgotten,explains that in general the rights of the interested party prevail to have theinformation about you is no longer linked to your name by a list ofresults obtained after a search from its name, but also explainsthat, this general rule yields for specific reasons with the role that the interested partyperform in public life, and the interference in their rights is fundamentallyjustified by the preponderant interest of the public in having access to informationin question.In this case, it should be noted that the information refers to the partclaimant in his professional activity and is considered of interest to citizens andWith regard to data protection regulations, we are not facing alegitimized treatment, consequently, the exclusion of the data does not proceedpersonal data of the complaining party of the claimed link through a search ininternet to be seen on the name of that person, prevailing the right tofreedom of expression and information against data protection considering thatIt is information that transcends the personal sphere when situated in aprofessional context that continues to be of general interest because it is not obsolete.Based on the foregoing, considering that the present procedure hasas an object that the guarantees and rights of those affected are dulyrestored, combining the information in the file with the regulationsreferred to in the preceding paragraphs, the present claim must be rejected.Considering the cited precepts and others of general application,the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection RESOLVES :FIRST: DISMISS the claim made by D.
