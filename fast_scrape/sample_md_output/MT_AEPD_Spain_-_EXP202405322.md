## English Summary

### Facts

ATRESMEDIA (the controller) is a large Spanish media company. The controller published a video online in one of their news broadcasts showing several young people. The faces were blurred, however the voices of at least three people (including the victim and aggressor, who were minors) were not altered. The Spanish DPA requested the controller to remove the video or distort the voices to make them unidentifiable. The controller later removed the video and kept the original as evidence.

### Holding

The definition and interpretation of personal data ([Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR")) and processing ([Article 4(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR")) is broad, and the DPA stated that the publication of a video with someone’s voice is processing of personal data. A person’s voice is unique and can reveal aspects of a person, including age and culture. A voice can also be used to identify someone, whether this is directly or indirectly. The DPA highlighted the technological advancements in AI that can easily identify someone, and the risks that can pose for a data subject’s fundamental rights.

The DPA then analysed whether the controller processed data according to the principle of data minimisation. According to Article 5(1)(c), the controller must consider the necessity and proportionality of the processing, including the risks and fundamental rights involved. The DPA also relied on [Article 39 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_39_GDPR "Article 39 GDPR") and Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case law, stating that the processing should be done through less intrusive means. The DPA concluded that the controller could have taken additional measures to process the data in a less intrusive means, and that the current technologies allow the controller to upload videos with distorted voices.

It is important to note that fundamental rights are not absolute. Here, the DPA considered the balance between the right to data protection and the right to freedom of expression and press. This means analysing whether the processing of personal data (voices) is necessary for the controller’s purpose (the publication of news). The DPA referred to case law from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to argue that the freedom of expression of the controller should be interpreted narrowly- this is because including the voices is not necessary to understand the facts of the news, and the mere wish to satisfy the public’s curiosity is not enough to justify the processing.

The DPA also highlighted the interpretation of the fundamental right to data protection in Spanish constitutional case law, which empowers the data subject to decide what data is given to third parties, and what is done with said data. Explicit consent (unless exceptional circumstances apply) and being informed, according to the Spanish Supreme Court, are indispensable aspects of this fundamental right. These rights are further enhanced in the case of minors, whose right to privacy may be prioritised even in cases of public interest.

The DPA fined the controller €50,000. This included aggravating factors such as several data subjects being minors, the negligence of the controller, and the potentially unlimited audience of the video online. Pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine and waive their right to appeal. This action reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The fine can be reduced by a further 20% if the controller acknowledges its liability. The controller opted for both and reduced the fine by 40%, paying the reduced sanction amount of €30,000.

The controller paid the fine on 10 April 2025. Finally, the DPA included corrective measures as well, requiring the controller to adopt necessary measures to avoid publishing personal data beyond what is necessary.

<<

File No.: EXP202405322

AGREEMENT TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Regarding the actions taken by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following

FACTS

FIRST: The Spanish Data Protection Agency became aware of certain

LEGAL BASIS

I
Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of the GDPR and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act),

the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

II

Procedure

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 3/24

Similarly, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

In accordance with Article 64 of the LOPDGDD, and taking into account the characteristics of the alleged violation, a sanctioning procedure shall be initiated.

The procedure will last a maximum of twelve months from the date of the initiation agreement. After this period, the proceedings will expire and, consequently, the proceedings will be archived, in accordance with the provisions of Article 64 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on Public Administrations).

If no objections are made to this initial resolution within the stipulated period, it may be considered a proposed resolution, as established in Article 64.2.f) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP).

III
Preliminary Questions

A person's voice, pursuant to Article 4.1 of the GDPR, is personal data because it makes them identifiable, and its protection is therefore the subject of the GDPR:

"Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is any person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person;"

The voice is a personal attribute specific to each natural person, defined by its pitch, intensity, and timbre. Endowed with unique and singular distinctive features that directly individualize it, associating it with a specific individual, it is molded by speaking, allowing us to discover, through it, an individual's age, sex, health status, personality, culture, origin, hormonal, emotional, and psychological state. Elements of expression, idiolect, and intonation are also personal data considered in conjunction with the voice. Therefore, Report 139/2017 of this Agency's Legal Department states that "the
image, as well as the voice of a person, is personal data, as is any information that allows their identity to be determined, directly or indirectly.
(...)" In fact, the National Court's ruling of March 19, 2014 (rec. 176/2012) states that "a person's voice constitutes personal data, as can be deduced from the definition provided in Article 3.a) of the LOPD, as <>, a matter that is not controversial."

Regarding the personal data of a natural person's voice, it is verified that the four components indicated in Opinion 4/2007 of the Article 29 Working Party on the concept of personal data are present: all information about an identified or identifiable natural person.

The aforementioned Opinion 4/2007 determines that "a natural person may be considered 'identified' when, within a group of persons, they are 'distinguished' from all the other members of the group." Through their voice, a natural person can be identified at least by those within their closest circle or who may know them in any other way.

Furthermore, their voice also makes a natural person indirectly identifiable to a larger segment of the population if combined with other data, including additional information, depending on the context. Once again, Opinion 4/2007 states that "In cases where, at first glance, the available identifiers do not allow a specific person to be identified, that person may still be "identifiable" because this information, combined with other data (whether or not the data controller is aware of it) will allow that person to be distinguished from others." In this regard, Recital 26 of the GDPR states that "...To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, all means, such as singling out, that can reasonably be used by the controller or any other person to directly or indirectly identify the natural person should be taken into account.
To determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that means will be used to identify a natural person, all objective factors, such as the costs and time required for identification, should be taken into account, taking into account both the technology available at the time of processing and technological developments..."

The reference to "all information" refers to the broad concept of what constitutes personal data, which requires a broad interpretation, in the sense of various CJEU rulings, such as the ECJ of 4 May 2023, in Case C-487/21 or the ECJ of 22 June 2023, in Case C-487/21 C-579/21.

Article 4.2 of the GDPR defines "processing" as: "any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording,

organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction."

In the present case, the inclusion of a person's voice in journalistic publications, which identifies or makes a person identifiable, constitutes the processing of personal data, and therefore the data controller who carries it out is obliged to comply with the obligations for the data controller set forth in the GDPR and the LOPDGDD.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 5/24

ATRESMEDIA carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, as it determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to Article 4.7 of the GDPR, which defines "controller" or "controller" as: "the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing; where the purposes and means of processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be laid down by Union or Member State law."

IV
Right to data protection

This procedure was initiated because ATRESMEDIA published, on the web link referenced in the events, a news story accompanied by a video showing

several minors (victim and aggressors) and one (...). While it is true that their faces were pixelated, the same was not true of their voices—at least three people: victim, physical aggressor, and the person recording—as they were clearly visible; this constitutes processing of the participants' personal data.

Having established the above, first of all, it should be remembered that individuals have the power to

dispose of their personal data, including their voice, as well as to disseminate it. Any person whose personal data is disseminated in violation of the legal system undoubtedly deserves protection.

Thus, STC 292/2000, of November 30, provides that "the content of the fundamental right to data protection consists of a power of disposition and control over personal data, which empowers the individual to decide which of those data to provide to a third party, whether the State or an individual, or which that third party may collect, and which also allows the individual to know who possesses that personal data and for what purpose, and to be able to object to such possession or use. These powers of disposition and control over personal data, which constitute part of the content of the fundamental right to data protection, are legally embodied in the right to consent to the collection, obtaining, and access to personal data, its subsequent storage and processing, as well as its use or possible uses, by a third party, whether the State or an individual. And this right to consent to the knowledge and processing, whether electronic or not, of personal data, requires, as essential complements, on the one hand, the ability to know at all times, who has possession of that personal data and what use it is being put to, and, on the other hand, the power to object to that possession and use.”

The principles relating to processing are, on the one hand, the starting point and closing clause of the data protection legal system, constituting true rules that inform the system with an intense expansive force. On the other hand, since they are highly specific, they are mandatory rules that are susceptible to being violated.

More specifically, it is worth highlighting the principle contained in Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, which establishes that:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 6/24

“1. Personal data shall be:

(…)

c) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (“data minimization”);”

Compliance with this principle requires, as a premise, an assessment of the

necessity and proportionality of the processing operations with respect to their purpose, taking into account whether the intended purposes can be achieved in a less intrusive manner, as well as the risks to the protection of individuals' fundamental rights and freedoms. Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR relates to Recital 39 of the GDPR, which states that “…the specific purposes for the processing of personal data must be explicit and legitimate, and must be determined at the time of collection. Personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that their retention period is limited to a strict minimum. Personal data should only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot reasonably be achieved by other means.”

As can be seen from the aforementioned recital, this requirement of necessity is not met when the objective pursued can reasonably be achieved as effectively by other means with less risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular with regard to the rights to respect for private life and the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. since exceptions and restrictions to the right to protection of such data must be established without exceeding the limits of what is strictly necessary (see, in this regard, judgment of 11 December 2019, Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064, paragraphs 46 and 47).

In any case, the default configuration should not include the collection of personal data that is not necessary for the specific purpose of the processing. In other words, if certain categories of personal data are unnecessary,

or if detailed data are not needed because less granular data are sufficient,
then personal data should not be collected.

In this case, if another processing implementation could achieve the same objective and is available under the terms described, or if processing of personal data is not required to achieve the same purpose, such personal data may be dispensed with, or may be processed with less extensive and intensive use of such data, this option will be preferable and will mean that no data processing is necessary, and, subsidiarily, that the data collection is necessary for the stated or intended purpose, and if so, that it is proportional. Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR reflects the principle of proportionality (see the judgment of
11/12/2019, Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, C-708/18, EU:C:2019:1064,
paragraph 48), meaning that, if there are alternatives to fulfill the same purpose intended by the respondent, the least intrusive one must be chosen. This principle is also related to the necessity of processing, both of which must be addressed since the use of personal data restricts rights and freedoms, such as data protection, when processing such data, and in this case also the right to dignity of the person who is slapped and of the minor.

V

Balance between the right to the protection of personal data and other fundamental rights and freedoms

However, the fundamental right to the protection of personal data is not absolute, since, where appropriate, it may give way to the prevalence of other rights and freedoms that are also constitutionally recognized and protected, such as, for example, the fundamental right to freedom of information or expression, weighing this on a case-by-case basis.

In this regard, the Article 29 Working Party, in its Opinion 06/2014 on the concept of the legitimate interest of the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC, when examining the legal basis for legitimate interest in Article 7(1)(f) of Directive 95/46/EC, which can be fully transferred to the current Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, includes the right to freedom of expression or information as one of the situations in which the question of legitimate interest may arise, stating that "without prejudice to whether the interests of the controller will ultimately prevail over the interests and rights of the data subjects when carrying out the balancing test."

That said, the fundamental rights to freedom of information or expression are not absolute either. We can observe very clear limits established

by the courts in the civil sphere, in relation to the right to honor, personal and family privacy, and one's own image.

Thus, we will cite Supreme Court Judgment 50/2017, First Civil Chamber, dated January 27, 2017 (appeal 2139/2015), which states:

“In this sense, it is settled case law (see among the most recent, and as a doctrinal summary, Judgment 605/2015, dated November 3) that the abstract prevalence of the freedoms of expression and information “can only be reversed in the specific case by taking into account the relative weight of honor and privacy according to the specific circumstances, provided that the information and opinions disseminated refer to matters of general interest or public relevance (for the persons or the subject matter), that the communication of such information and opinions avoids the unnecessary use or employment of unequivocally offensive or derogatory expressions, and, in the case of freedom of information, provided that they are truthful, specifying in any case that in
the area of protection of the right to privacy, the criterion for determining the

legitimacy or illegitimacy of intrusions is not truthfulness but the
public relevance of the disclosed fact, that is, that its communication to the public opinion, even if true, is necessary based on the public interest of the matter being reported" (emphasis added).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 8/24

It is not a question of granting priority to one fundamental right over another, but rather of finding a balance between the two that allows for the reconciliation of both rights;

a reconciliation to which the European legislator itself refers in Article 85 of the GDPR. And one of the elements to consider is precisely whether the interference—in the case at hand, the processing of personal data from the voices of several young people—is or is not necessary to achieve the intended purpose; in this specific case, the publication of the news story.

At this point, we must bring up the case law that analyzes the relationship between freedom of information and expression, on the one hand, and the rights of those affected by informational content.

Thus, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), in its judgment of June 19, 2012, in appeal 1593/2006, states the following:

Although the press must not overstep certain limits, particularly with regard to the reputation and rights of others or the sound administration of justice, it is nevertheless obliged to provide, in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities, information and ideas on all matters of public interest.

(paragraph 48)

(…) the publication of photographs and articles whose sole purpose is to satisfy the curiosity of a particular reader regarding the details of the private life of a public figure cannot be considered to contribute to any debate of general interest to society, even if the person is known to the public. Under such conditions, freedom of expression requires a stricter interpretation.

(paragraph 50) (emphasis added)

(…) In verifying whether the authorities have struck a fair balance between two protected values guaranteed by the Convention that may conflict with each other in such cases—freedom of expression protected by Article 10 and the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8—the Court of Justice must balance the public interest in publishing the information against the need to protect private life (see Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France, no. 71111/01, § 43, ECHR 2007-VII). (Paragraph 51)

And it concludes that, since the parties affected by the news are not public figures, “the disclosure of their identity cannot be considered essential to understanding the details of the case (paragraph 57)” and that “there is no doubt that the preservation of the most private sphere of public life of a minor who had become

the victim of a custody dispute and had not entered the public sphere deserved
particular protection due to his vulnerable position. (paragraph 59)" (emphasis added).

In this regard, and considering the circumstances of the case analyzed, in which

personal data—the voices of several young people—were disseminated as part of an informative
content that ATRESMEDIA directs to its readers, it must be understood that
the limits indicated by case law regarding the necessary
safeguarding of the fundamental rights of those affected apply.

On the other hand, and as it is of interest in the case at hand, it is worth mentioning Judgment 27/2020, of February 24, issued by the Constitutional Court in its Appeal 1379/2017, in which, after stating that "we must once again emphasize that physical appearance, as a basic instrument of identification and external projection and an essential factor for self-recognition as a person, constitutes the first element that shapes the personal sphere of every individual" (STC 156/2001, FJ 6 and 99/1994, FJ 5), it concludes that "the first rule for achieving the protection of this fundamental right is that in order to capture, reproduce, and/or publish the image of a person, their consent is essential." unequivocal, with exceptional cases in which such authorization is not required (…)”

At this point, it is appropriate to refer to ruling 117/1994, of April 25 (RTC 1994\\117), which now places this right to voice within the orbit of the right to one's own image by stating that "the right to one's own image, recognized by Article 18.1 of the Constitution along with the rights to honor and personal privacy, is part of the rights of personality and, as such, guarantees the scope of a person's freedom regarding their most characteristic, personal, and immediate attributes, such as their physical image, voice, or name, qualities that define one's own being and attributed as an inherent and irreducible possession to every person. To the extent that this freedom is manifested in the physical world through the actions of their body and its qualities, it is evident that with the protection of their image, safeguards
the scope of privacy and, at the same time, the power to decide on the purposes for which the person's expressions through their image, identity, or voice are to be applied."

Thus, the considerations made by case law regarding the image of a natural person must be extended to their voice, which is, as noted, personal data.

The court then reasons as follows:

"When the right to one's own image collides with other constitutionally protected rights or assets, particularly the freedoms of expression and information (Article 20.1.a and d of the Spanish Constitution), the different competing interests must be weighed and, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case, a decision must be made as to which interest deserves greater protection" (Constitutional Court Judgments 105/1990, June 6; Judgment 72/2007, Legal Judgment 5 and
156/2001, Legal Judgment 6). (...) As is easily Inferably, this occurs not only in its conflict with the rights to honor and privacy, but also with the fundamental right to one's own image, for example, in cases where photographs or video clips are disseminated in the information that can only be understood as mere instruments to satisfy the curiosity of others and have been included not for informational purposes, but rather for the purpose of satisfying the expectations that, in those terms, a particular news item may raise.

(...) the image of an anonymous or unknown individual, or in other words, someone who does not hold a public office or a well-known profession, even if captured in a public place, cannot be used without their express consent, except in two cases. First, when the person appears in the photograph in a merely accessory and inconsequential manner, without any leading role. Second, in the event that the person's participation in the newsworthy event of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 10/24

The initially anonymous person was the principal or protagonist, in which case their fundamental right to image must give way to the right to information, precisely because of the non-incidental role assumed by the subject. (…)

Although the risks of interference have increased exponentially with the widespread use of social media, to prevent them, we must continue to work from the same basic principle that governs the analog environment and affirm that the constitutional recognition of the fundamental rights included in Article 18 of the Spanish Constitution entails the individual's right to control the data circulating on the social network that concerns them. Therefore, we reiterate that, unless there is unequivocal authorization for the capture, reproduction, or publication of the image by its owner, interference with the fundamental right to one's own image must necessarily be justified by the overriding public interest in having access
to it and disseminating it. (…) Consent only covers that which constitutes the
object of the declaration of will. The holder of the fundamental right must authorize

the specific act of using their image and the purposes for which it is granted. The
consent given, for example, for the capture of the image does not extend to
other subsequent acts, such as its publication or dissemination.”

Considering the above, and noting that there has been a
processing of personal data that constitutes an interference with the fundamental right

to the protection of personal data of the participants whose voices are reproduced in the aforementioned video, it must be remembered that those affected by this
violation were minors at the time of the events. In this regard, it is worth noting some of the numerous judicial rulings that highlight the enhanced protection that minors should be afforded against unlawful interference with their fundamental rights.

Thus, according to the Supreme Court, First Chamber, Civil, in its Judgment 1003/2008 of October 23, 2008, (Recital 174/2005, Second Legal Basis):

“The Constitution, in its Article 18, recognizes in general terms the right to honor, personal and family privacy, and one's own image, and in Article 20.1.d) the right to freely communicate or receive truthful information by any means of dissemination, specifying that this freedom is limited by respect for the rights recognized in this title and "especially the right to honor, privacy, one's own image, and the protection of youth and childhood." In

consistent with the above, the special protection that must be given to data relating to minors has been legally incorporated in Organic Law 1/96, of January 15,
Legal Protection of Minor.

In interpreting these fundamental rights, the Constitutional Court has

stated that for the right to privacy to legitimately be used as a limitation on the right to freedom of receiving or transmitting information, it is necessary that the news disseminated lack public interest or, even if it is of public interest, lack truthfulness. In a democratic society that proclaims respect for human dignity as one of the principles inspiring its coexistence, the disclosure of facts that pertain to the privacy of private citizens should not be tolerated, nor should it be tolerated that the news disseminated be untrue, not in the sense that it coincides exactly with what happened, but in the sense that it has been displayed by

whoever publishes it, the necessary diligence. to ensure that what is being disseminated is not
a mere rumor—Constitutional Court Rulings 54/2004, of April 15, and 61/2004, of April 19.

However, in cases involving minors, constitutional doctrine has granted a sphere of super-protection that requires extreme caution regarding the information provided about them, even if it is of public interest. Thus, the Constitutional Court has stated that the legitimate interest of a minor in not disclosing data relating to their family or personal life "seems to impose an insurmountable limit on both freedom of expression and the fundamental right to freely communicate truthful information, without the alleged veracity of what is revealed exonerating the media outlet from liability for intruding into the private lives of both minors," even if the news deserves to be described as neutral. -Judgment of the Constitutional Court

of July 15, 1999" (emphasis added)

Along the same lines, it is worth noting the ruling of the Supreme Court in its
Judgment 777/2021 of November 11, 2021, (First Chamber, Civil, Rec. 6775/2020):

"In the words of STC 158/2009, of June 29, 2009 (FJ 4):

"It should be remembered that, in accordance with Article 20.4 of the Spanish Constitution, the freedoms of expression and information are limited by respect for the rights recognized in Title I, in the laws that implement it, and, especially, in the right to honor, privacy, one's own image, and the protection of youth and children." Likewise, international child protection standards should not be overlooked (the interpretive value of which, under Article 10.2 of the EC Treaty, is unnecessary to insist upon), and among them, in particular, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (ratified by Spain by instrument of 30 November 1990), which guarantees children's right to the protection of the law against arbitrary or unlawful interference with their private life (Article 16), as well as the European Parliament Resolution on the European Charter of the Rights of the Child, which establishes that "every child has the right not to be subjected by a third party to unjustified intrusions into his or her private life or that of his or her family, nor to suffer unlawful attacks on his or her honor" (Section 8, paragraph 29 of Resolution A 3-0172/92 of 8 July).

"In turn, Organic Law 1/1982, of May 5, on the protection of the right to honor, privacy, and one's own image, after establishing that no illegitimate intrusion into the protected area will be deemed when the holder of the right has given his or her express consent to this effect (Article 2), then specifies in Article 3 that, with regard to minors (and incapacitated persons), their consent must be given by themselves, if their maturity allows it. If not, consent must be given in writing by their legal representatives, who will be required to inform the Public Prosecutor's Office of their planned consent in advance. The judge must decide if the Public Prosecutor's Office objects within eight days. (…)"

Therefore, the media process personal data in the exercise of freedom of information and are responsible for the processing of, among other personal data, the voice of natural persons.

As data controllers, they must comply with the obligations set forth in the GDPR, including, among others, verifying the existence of a legal basis that legitimizes the processing of personal data, applying the principles related to processing or conducting risk analyses (Article 24 of the GDPR), and conducting data protection impact assessments when necessary (Article 35 of the GDPR).

In any processing of personal data, there are risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals arising from such processing, which the data controller must identify, assess, and evaluate in order to implement all kinds of technical and organizational measures to prevent or mitigate the aforementioned risks from materializing. It must be taken into account that, on occasion, the materialization of risks can have a very significant impact on the rights and freedoms of data subjects, and the damage can be irreversible and irreparable. The current technological context must be considered in the risk analysis.

In the current technological context, marked by the exponential development of artificial intelligence and its ability to analyze, identify, and associate voices and images with unprecedented precision, the need for extreme caution in the processing of this personal data is reinforced. Artificial intelligence makes it possible, even from minimal voice or image fragments, to reconstruct identities, generate detailed profiles, or create hyper-realistic simulations, which significantly increases the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals.

And all this in addition to respecting the principle of data minimization applicable to the manner and medium in which information is provided and disseminated due to its immediate impact on the personal data of a natural person. Thus, the data controller will assess, prior to carrying out the processing, that the dissemination of personal data is as least intrusive as possible, analyzing and implementing, where appropriate, other ways of providing the information (alternative measures) that pose a lower risk to the right to personal data protection, including respect for privacy. For this reason, the data controller, before carrying out the processing in application of the principle of proactive accountability (Article 5.2 of the GDPR), must conduct this risk analysis and document it for the specific situation in question, also applying the principle of data minimization, in order to adopt, if necessary given the situation of a natural person, the appropriate technical and organizational measures to make the fundamental right to freedom of information compatible with the fundamental right to the protection of personal data.

In this regard, it should be noted that current technology allows information to be published, even in a video, without making the participants identifiable, so that a media outlet could provide the information while respecting data protection regulations.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 13/24

Technical measures consisting of the use of technical procedures to prevent voice recognition, such as, for example, voice distortion, may be sufficient for such purposes, which must be assessed in all cases by the data controller.

As we can see, it is not a question of granting priority to one fundamental right over another, having to choose which has more weight in a specific case, but rather of finding a balance between the two to achieve the purpose of the former without distorting the latter, and always on a case-by-case basis. The reconciliation of both rights is established by the European legislator in Article 85 of the GDPR.

Consequently, based on the evidence available at this time regarding the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered that the known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to ATRESMEDIA, for violation of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR.

VI
Classification of the infringement of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR and qualification for the purposes of the statute of limitations.

The known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to ATRESMEDIA, of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, within the scope expressed in the previous Legal Basis. This, if confirmed, could lead to the commission of the infringement classified in Article 83.5, section a) of the GDPR, which, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines," provides:

"Infringements of the following provisions shall be In accordance with Section 2, they shall impose administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher:

a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in Article 71 “Infractions,” establishes that:

“The acts and conduct referred to in Sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements.”

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72 "Very Serious Violations" of the LOPDGDD states:

"1. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, violations that entail a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

aepd, and in particular, the following:

a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees established in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)"

VII
Proposed sanction for violation of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:

a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered;

b) the intentionality or negligence in the breach;
c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects;
d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous breaches committed by the controller or processor;
f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;
h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent;

i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have been previously ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct conduct under Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved under Article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 15/24

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data) provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.
b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.
c) The benefits obtained as a result of committing the infringement.

d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have induced to the commission of the infringement.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.
f) The violation of the rights of minors.
g) Having, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.

h) The voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in those cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential infringement, paying special attention to the consequences that its commission has on those affected, a fine would be appropriate, in addition to the adoption of measures, if appropriate.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee
these principles, ATRESMEDIA's turnover of €698,710,610 in fiscal year 2023 is considered as a preliminary matter.

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available for the initiation of sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions. As a preliminary matter, the following circumstances are deemed to be present:

- The nature, severity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages and losses they have suffered (Article 83.2(a) of the GDPR). The publication

of the personal voice data of the participants in the video by ATRESMEDIA in its digital newspaper poses the possibility of immediate and far-reaching dissemination of the content, which leads to the affected individuals losing control over their personal data.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 16/24

Furthermore, several people are affected by this processing, at least three people:
the victim, the physical aggressor, and the person recording.

In this regard, the ECJ (Judgment of 1/08/2022) in Case C-184/20 (OT and Vyriausioji) highlights the amplifying effect of the internet, stating that:
"102 Furthermore, it is clear that such processing leads to such personal data being freely accessible on the internet by the general public and, as a result, by a potentially unlimited number of people."

- The intentionality or negligence in the infringement (Article 83.2, letter b) of the GDPR). ATRESMEDIA's actions may be considered negligent by failing to ensure a procedure that would guarantee the protection of personal data in such sensitive circumstances, especially when there is the possibility of distorting the voice in the news reports so that the speakers cannot be recognized. This technique, which ATRESMEDIA has used with respect to the image of the participants in the video, but not with respect to their voices; Although, as we have been indicating, this is also personal data to which personal data regulations apply.

- The categories of personal data affected by the infringement
(Article 83.2(g) of the GDPR). Although no "special categories of personal data" have been affected, as defined by the GDPR in
Article 9, the personal data to which the actions refer (the voice of the minors participating in the video) is of a particularly sensitive nature, as it allows for the early identification of the individual and increases
the risks to their privacy.

The following grading factors are also considered as aggravating factors:

- Any previous infringement committed by the controller or processor (Article 83.2(e) of the GDPR). This Agency is aware of a sanctioning procedure (...) in which, on July 7, 2023, a "Resolution terminating the procedure through voluntary payment" was issued after ATRESMEDIA accepted the two reductions provided for in the Initiation Agreement and paid €30,000. In the aforementioned sanctioning procedure, ATRESMEDIA was accused of violating Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, classified in Article 83.5.a) of the GDPR.

- The violation of the rights of minors (Article 76.2, letter f) of the LOPDGDD). ATRESMEDIA processed personal data belonging to minors, so, given their particular vulnerability, it can be considered that a violation of their right to personal data protection would have particularly significant implications and consequences.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 17/24

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 5.1.c), allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of

€50,000 (fifty thousand euros).

VIII
Corrective Measures

If the violation is confirmed, the resolution issued may establish the corrective measures that the offending entity must adopt to end the non-compliance with personal data protection legislation, in this case Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, in accordance with the aforementioned Article 58.2.d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period..." The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction of an administrative fine, as provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR.

Thus, the responsible entity may be required to bring its actions into compliance with personal data protection regulations, within the scope expressed in the previous Legal Basis.

This document establishes the alleged violation committed and the facts that could lead to this potential violation of data protection regulations. From this, it is clear what measures to be adopted, without prejudice to the specific procedures, mechanisms, or instruments to implement them being the responsibility of the sanctioned party, as the data controller is fully familiar with their organization and must decide, based on proactive responsibility and a risk-based approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the LOPDGDD. However, in this case, regardless of the foregoing, in accordance with the evidence currently available regarding the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, the resolution adopted may require ATRESMEDIA to adopt the following measures within 3 months from the date of the executive order finalizing this procedure:

- Prove that the necessary measures have been adopted to ensure compliance with the provisions of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, to prevent the excessive publication or dissemination of personal data, particularly that of minors.

Please note that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by this body in the resolution of this sanctioning procedure may be considered an administrative infraction pursuant to the provisions of the GDPR, classified as an infraction in Articles 83.5 and 83.6. Such conduct may lead to the opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 18/24

Furthermore, please remember that neither the acknowledgment of the infraction committed nor, where applicable, the voluntary payment of the proposed amounts exempts you from the obligation to adopt the relevant measures to cease the conduct or correct the effects of the infraction committed, nor from the obligation to prove compliance with this obligation to this AEPD.

IX
Provisional Measure

Articles 69.1 and 2 of the LOPDGDD provide the following:

“1. During the conduct of preliminary investigations or the initiation of a procedure for the exercise of sanctioning powers, the Spanish Data Protection Agency may, with reasons, agree on the necessary and proportionate provisional measures to safeguard the fundamental right to data protection, and in particular, those provided for in Article 66.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

the precautionary blocking of the data and the immediate obligation to comply with the requested right.

2. In cases where the Spanish Data Protection Agency considers that the continued processing of personal data, its communication, or international transfer would entail a serious impairment of the right to personal data protection, it may order the data controllers or processors to block the data and cease processing, and, if necessary, If these orders are not complied with, the data shall be frozen. (…)”

In the present case, within the framework of the preliminary investigation procedures outlined in the fourth section of “Facts,” it was agreed to require ATRESMEDIA, as a precautionary measure, to remove the video in question or distort the voices of those involved.

The facts analyzed pose a high risk to the guarantees and freedoms of those affected, such that continued processing entails a very serious and irreparable impairment of the rights of the minors affected. Therefore, the provisional suspension of processing is the only measure that can be adopted to safeguard the Fundamental Right to Data Protection, and is, in addition, the least harmful, onerous, and proportional measure for ATRESMEDIA.

Based on these premises and in order to safeguard and guarantee the rights and freedoms of those affected, in accordance with the provisions of Article 69 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), it is deemed appropriate to confirm the provisional measure agreed upon during the preliminary investigation phase.

Therefore, in light of the foregoing, the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
HAS AGREED:

FIRST: TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEEDINGS against ATRESMEDIA CORPORACIÓN DE MEDIOS DE COMUNICACIÓN, S.A., with NIF A78839271, for the alleged violation of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, as defined in Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 19/24

SECOND: CONFIRM the provisional measure imposed on ATRESMEDIA
CORPORACIÓN DE MEDIOS DE COMUNICACIÓN, S.A., with NIF A78839271,
consisting of the removal of the video in question or distortion of the voices of those involved in it, in accordance with the provisions of Article 69 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data).

The provisional measure must be maintained until the final resolution of the procedure, at which point it must be confirmed, modified, or lifted.

THIRD: APPOINT A.A.A. as investigating judge. and, as secretary, B.B.B.,
indicating that they may be challenged, if appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of
Articles 23 and 24 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector (LRJSP).

FOURTH: INCORPORATE into the file, for evidentiary purposes, the documents
obtained and generated by the Subdirectorate General of Data Inspection in the actions prior to the initiation of this sanctioning procedure.

FIFTH: THAT for the purposes provided for in Article 64.2 b) of the LPACAP, the sanction that may be imposed would be an administrative fine of €50,000 (fifty thousand euros), without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation.

SIXTH: NOTIFY this agreement to ATRESMEDIA CORPORACIÓN DE

MEDIA DE COMUNICACIÓN, S.A., with Tax Identification Number (NIF) A78839271, granting it a hearing period of ten business days to formulate its allegations and present any evidence it deems appropriate. In its written allegations, it must provide its NIF and the procedure number shown in the heading of this document.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code), it may acknowledge its liability within the period granted for the formulation of allegations to this initiation agreement; this will entail a 20% reduction in the sanction to be imposed in this procedure. With the application of this reduction, the sanction would be set at €40,000 (forty thousand euros), and the procedure would be resolved with the imposition of this sanction.

Similarly, at any time prior to the resolution of this procedure, the applicant may voluntarily pay the proposed penalty, which will result in a 20% reduction in its amount. With the application of this reduction, the penalty would be set at €40,000 (forty thousand euros), and its payment would imply the termination of the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

The reduction for voluntary payment of the penalty is cumulative with the reduction applicable for acknowledgment of liability, provided that this acknowledgment of liability is made clear within the period granted for submitting allegations at the opening of the procedure. Voluntary payment of the amount referred to in the preceding paragraph may be made at any time prior to the resolution. In this case, if both reductions were to be applied, the penalty would be set at €30,000 (thirty thousand euros).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 20/24

In any case, the effectiveness of either of the two aforementioned reductions will be subject to the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the penalty.

If you choose to voluntarily pay any of the amounts indicated above (€40,000 or €30,000), you must do so by depositing it into account IBAN: ES00-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000 (BIC/SWIFT Code: CAIXESBBXXX) opened in the name of the Spanish Data Protection Agency at CAIXABANK, S.A., indicating in the account the reference number of the procedure listed in the heading of this document and the reason for the reduction in the amount you are applying for.

You must also send proof of payment to the Subdirectorate General of Inspection of the fine in order to continue the procedure in accordance with the amount paid.

In compliance with Articles 14, 41, and 43 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Protection Act), you are hereby advised that, from now on, notifications sent to you will be sent exclusively electronically, through the Single Authorized Electronic Address (dehu.redsara.es) and the Electronic Office (sedeagpd.gob.es). If you do not access them, your rejection will be recorded in the file, deeming the procedure completed and following the procedure. You are hereby informed that you may provide this Agency with an email address to receive notification of the availability of notifications and that failure to provide this notification will not prevent the notification from being considered fully valid.
