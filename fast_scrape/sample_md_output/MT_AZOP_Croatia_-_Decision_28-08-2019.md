## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a health clinic and has been in an ongoing legal dispute with data subject (for unknown reasons). The data subject requested the controller to erase her personal data because her name and surname were published in a document called "_Notes to the financial statements for the period from 1.1.2018 to 31.12.2018_". This document was publicly available on the controller's website. The controller refused to comply with the data subject's request, so the data subject filed a complaint with the DPA.

The Croatian DPA (AZOP) requested the controller to stipulate the legal basis and purpose of the processing, and why they refused to comply with the data subject's request. The controller stated that it had a legal obligation to publish the personal data. They explained that, according to national law, they were obligated to publish annual financial statements on its website. Moreover, as part of this obligation, they also had to publish details that provide further explanation to the financial data. These details were published in the above-mentioned document. Since the controller and the data subject were in a legal dispute, and information on disputes must be published in these financial notes, the controller claimed that it had to publish the data subject's personal data.

### Holding

The DPA upheld the data subject's complaint.

The DPA considered that it follows from national law that the controller is obligated to publish an annual financial statement, with supplementary notes that provide further explanation on, inter alia, the controller's ongoing legal disputes. However, the national legislation does not prescribe that these notes must contain the name and surname of the parties in the dispute, since a description of the dispute suffices. Hence, the DPA concluded that the controller had no legal basis to publish the data subject's personal data, in violation of [Article 5](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 6](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), and [Article 25 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR "Article 25 GDPR"). It ordered the controller to comply with the data subject's erasure request pursuant to [Article 17(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR"), and to take appropriate measures to protect personal data to ensure that the document is not searchable via Google search.

## Comment

The DPA stated that the controller (also) violated [Article 25 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR "Article 25 GDPR") because they published the data subject's personal data on their website, without a legal basis. Unfortunately, the legal reasoning is unclear. One can assume that the controller neglected to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures that ensure adherence to data protection principles, such as the principle of data minimisation. However, a violation of (one of) these principles does not necessarily lead to a violation of [Article 25 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR "Article 25 GDPR"), and it is thus unclear what measures the controller had neglected to implement.
