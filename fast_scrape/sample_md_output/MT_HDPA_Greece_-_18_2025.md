## English Summary

### Facts

Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co. (DeepSeek) is a company established in China that provides an LLM platform called ‘DeepSeek AI’, to data subjects located in Europe.

The Hellenic DPA initiated ex officio investigations against DeepSeek for the services provided in the EU and particularly in Greece.

The DPA addressed a letter to DeepSeek reminding them that they fall within the scope of the GDPR according to [Article 3(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_3_GDPR#3 "Article 3 GDPR") and have an obligation to a appoint a representative in the EU in writing pursuant to [Article 27 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_27_GDPR "Article 27 GDPR"). The DPA also addressed them a number of questions in order to determine their compliance with the GDPR, regarding the lawfulness of processing, the processing activities and the legal basis for each processing activity of personal data of data subjects located in Greece, their obligation to ensure that data subjects can exercise their rights and the location of the data centres used for hosting and providing the DeepSeek software.

DeepSeek denied offering services in the EU and therefore falling within the scope of the GDPR, but stated that they are willing to accept the DPA's advice and guidance on this obligation. DeepSeek answered the questions vaguely without mentioning all relevant provisions of the GDPR and stated that they store data in China, without mentioning the establishment of additional legal safeguards.

Furthermore, DeepSeek’s privacy policy does not make any reference to the GDPR and uses unclear wording.

After examining all relevant information, the DPA issued a decision.

### Holding

First, the DPA held that the services offered by DeepSeek are undoubtedly addressed and targeted to EU data subjects and therefore DeepSeek falls within the scope [Article 3(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_3_GDPR#3 "Article 3 GDPR"). DeepSeek, acting as a controller, makes clear its intention to offer services to data subjects located in the EU and in particular to Greece, as it is accessible both via the internet and through mobile applications to data subjects located in Greece and the applications are also available in Greek.

In this case, according to [Article 27 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_27_GDPR "Article 27 GDPR"), DeepSeek was required to appoint in writing a representative in the EU, who must be established in one of the Member States where the data subjects whose data are processed in connection with an offer of goods or services to them or whose behaviour is monitored are located.

Second, the DPA points that in the case of a controller without an establishment in the EU, which falls within the scope of the GDPR on the basis of the targeting criterion set out in [Article 3(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_3_GDPR#3 "Article 3 GDPR"), each national supervisory authority is competent to monitor his compliance with the GDPR in the territory of its Member State.

In the light of the above, the DPA found an infringement and ordered DeepSeek to appoint a representative in the EU in writing, as required by [Article 27 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_27_GDPR "Article 27 GDPR").

## Comment

_Following the above order, DeepSeek informed the DPA on 28 May 2025 that it appointed Prighter EU Rep GmbH, a company based in Vienna, as its representative in the EU._

Summary
In the context of exercising its powers to supervise the implementation of the provisions of the General Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data (GDPR), of Law 4624/2019 and of other regulations concerning the protection of individuals from the processing of personal data, the Authority initiated, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 57 par. 1 a’, 58 par. 1 b’ of the GDPR and 13 par. 1 h’ and 15 par. 1 of Law 4624/2019, an ex officio inspection procedure at the company Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd. regarding the Artificial Intelligence services of the DeepSeek platform that it provides both on the internet and through a related application (web- and app-based) to personal data subjects located in Europe and in particular in Greece.

The Authority found that the company Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd. violated its obligation to appoint a representative in the EU under Article 27 GDPR, because, although it does not have an establishment in the EU, it falls within the scope of the GDPR, based on Article 3 para. 2 letter b’ and, consequently, is obliged to appoint a representative in the EU in accordance with Article 27 GDPR, it has not fulfilled this obligation.

The Authority addressed the company Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co. (data controller), which provides AI services through the DeepSeek platform, based on Article 58, paragraph 2, subparagraph d of the GDPR, is mandated to appoint a representative in the EU in writing, in accordance with the provision of Article 27 of the GDPR and to inform the Authority accordingly.
