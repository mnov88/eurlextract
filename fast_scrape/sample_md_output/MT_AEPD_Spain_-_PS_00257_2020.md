## English Summary

### Facts

Ayuntamiento de Arroyomolinos was found lacking a Data Protection Officer (DPO).

The defendant has since adopted corrective measures. A DPO has been appointed pursuant to a service contract from 28.09.2020.

### Dispute

Was the municipality Ayuntamiento de Arroyomolinos under the obligation to appoint a DPO?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA recalled that the public administrations act as controllers for the processing of personal data and on some occasions as processors. As a result, they are subject to the GDPR and must fulfill all its obligations, including the obligation to appoint a data protection officer (Article 37 GDPR). This obligation had to be fulfilled starting from 28.05.2018, the date of entry into force of the GDPR.

The Spanish DPA issued a reprimand against Ayuntamiento de Arroyomolinos for violating Article 37 GDPR. The reprimand was issued by virtue of the power conferred by Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.

which details the content of the services to be provided".

SIXTH: A motion for resolution was tabled on 18 November 2020,
proposing to sanction the Town Hall of Arroyomolinos with a warning
NIF P2801500F, for an infringement of Article 37 of the RGPD, typified in Article
83.4 of the RGPD.

SEVENTH: After notification of the motion for a resolution, the respondent submitted a letter of
allegations in which, in summary, he stated

"FIRST - That on September 28, 2020, it was awarded by Decree No
2497/2020 technical assistance service contract for support and updates in

information security (ENS) and personal data protection
(RGPD-LOPGDD) and the Data Protection Officer Service, for a period of

the evidence is based on the documents provided with their
allegations to the agreement of initiation that the respondent has appointed as Delegate of

FOURTH - Taking into consideration the Judgment of the Audiencia Nacional de
29/11/2013, (ECR 455/2011), on the basis of the Sixth
warning regulated in article 45.6 of the LOPD and regarding its nature

legal warns that it "does not constitute a penalty" and that these are "measures
corrective measures for the cessation of the activity constituting the infringement" replacing
sanction. The Decision understands that Article 45.6 of the LOPD confers on the AEPD

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/7

a "power" different from the sanctioning power, the exercise of which is conditional on the
concurrence of the special circumstances described in the precept. At
congruence with the nature attributed to the warning as an alternative to

penalty when, in view of the circumstances of the case, the subject of the offence is not
and considering that the object of the warning is the
imposition of corrective measures, the above-mentioned SAN concludes that where these measures have already
have been adopted, it is appropriate in law to agree to the closure of the
performances".

In view of all that has been done, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency
the following are regarded as established facts in these proceedings,

                                      FACTS

The infringement is contemplated as such in Article 83.4.a of the RGPD which states: "4. The
infringements of the following provisions shall be penalised in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 10 000 000 or
in the case of an enterprise, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2 % of
total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for
the largest:

(a) the obligations of the person responsible and of the person appointed under Articles 8, 11, 25 to

Article 83.7 of the RGPD states:

"Without prejudice to the corrective powers of the supervisory authorities under the ar-
in accordance with Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down rules as to whether or not a
of, and to what extent, imposing administrative fines on public authorities and bodies

public bodies established in that Member State"

## Article 58(2) of the GPRS states: "Each supervisory authority shall have all the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/7

the following corrective powers are indicated below:

under this article."

                                             III

## Article 73 of the LOPDDG states Infringements considered serious:

"In accordance with Article 83(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the
consider serious and will prescribe after two years any infringements involving a
substantial breach of the articles mentioned in that one, and in particular the

following:

when his appointment is required in accordance with Article 37 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 and article 34 of this organic law"

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/7

By means of a statement of claim, the respondent has stated that he has already designated
Data Protection Delegate.

In spite of this, the Spanish Data Protection Agency has sanctioned the complainant with
a penalty of a warning, since the latter must have had a delegate from
data protection in accordance with article 37 of the RGPD,
from 25 May 2018, when the RGPD came into force.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed on the basis of
graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been accredited, the Director of
Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE on the ARROYOMOLINOS CITY COUNCIL, with NIF
P2801500F, for a violation of Article 37 of the GPRS, as defined in Article 83.4
of the RGPD, a warning sanction.
