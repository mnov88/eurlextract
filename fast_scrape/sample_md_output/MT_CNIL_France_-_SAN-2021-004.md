## English Summary

### Facts

On 7 December 2020, the CNIL [fined Google €100,000,000](/index.php?title=CNIL_-_SAN-2020-012 "CNIL - SAN-2020-012") for not complying with the cookies regulation.

The CNIL had also given Google a limited time to adapt their cookies settings to the current regulation, with a daily fine of €100,000 in case they did not carry out the necessary adjustments to start complying within the three following months.

On 18 December 2020, Google sent a letter to the CNIL informing of their plan for compliance. After the CNIL's answer, on 30 March 2021 Google delivered to the CNIL the necessary information showing their adjustments for compliance.

### Holding

The CNIL accepted Google's reply on their adjustments, considering that the cookie banner and the cookies mechanisms used by google.fr were now sufficiently clear and provided adequate information about the cookies they use, including the purposes of the processing and information about how to reject them.

Therefore, the CNIL decided to close the case. However, the authority stated that this [only refers to the precautionary measures took in their original decision](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cloture-injonction-prononcee-encontre-google), and that they reserve the right to further analysis of Google's compliance with the cookies regulation and their [recommendation issued on 17 September 2020](https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/recommandation-cookies-et-autres-traceurs.pdf), and to initiate a new sanctioning proceeding if necessary.
