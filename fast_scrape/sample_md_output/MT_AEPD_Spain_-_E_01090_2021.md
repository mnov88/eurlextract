## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject made a complaint to the Spanish DPA because a party in a legal proceeding against the data subject shared with another counterparty in the same legal proceeding with the same data subject a legal document containing personal data of the data subject.

### Dispute

Can the right of data protection preclude sharing documents containing personal data with the courts and the other parties involved in the context of a legal proceeding?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA, based on case-law from the Spanish Constitutional Court, held that in the context of legal proceeding where the data subject is a party, it is not necessary to ask for his consent in order to share documents that are used as evidence in a trial with the court and with the other counterparties in the proceedings.

## Comment

The decision from the Spanish DPA does not analyze in detail the articles of the GDPR but makes a general balancing act between the right of data protection and the right to due process and the right to legal defence. It argues that individuals can't use data protection rights to avoid disclosing personal data that is relevant for the legal proceedings.

It is part of the confidentiality and professional secrecy established in article 5 of the

On October 20, 2020, the claim is admitted for processing.

                                FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                                 I

In accordance with the investigative and corrective powers that article 58 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter
RGPD) grants each control authority, and according to the provisions of article 47 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and

guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), is competent to
resolve these investigative actions by the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection.

                                                II

The RGPD defines in its article 4:

"1)" personal data ": any information about an identified natural person or
identifiable ("the interested party"); an identifiable natural person shall be considered any person
whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of
an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, data from
location, an online identifier or one or more elements of the identity
physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person; "

  2) "treatment": any operation or set of operations carried out on
personal data or personal data sets, whether by procedures
automated or not, such as collection, registration, organization, structuring,
conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,

communication by transmission, broadcast or any other form of authorization of
access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction;

  4) "file": any structured set of personal data, accessible in accordance with
  to certain criteria, whether centralized, decentralized or distributed in a
  functional or geographic;

  7) "controller" or "controller": the natural or legal person,
authority, service or other body that, alone or together with others, determines the purposes and
means of treatment; whether the law of the Union or of the Member States

determines the purposes and means of the treatment, the person responsible for the treatment or

or the Member States\].

  9) "addressee": the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other
body to which personal data is communicated, whether or not it is a third party. Do not
However, public authorities that may receive

personal data in the framework of a specific investigation in accordance with the
Union or Member State law; the treatment of such data by
said public authorities will be in accordance with the rules on protection
of data applicable to the purposes of the treatment;

  10) "third party": natural or legal person, public authority, service or body

other than the interested party, the person responsible for the treatment, the person in charge of the treatment
and of the persons authorized to process personal data under the authority
direct from the person in charge or the person in charge; "

                                             III

The Constitutional Court has declared, in its Sentence 292/2000, of November 30,
Regarding the fundamental right to data protection, “that the right to

Data protection is not unlimited, and although the Constitution does not impose express-
specific limits, nor refer to the Public Powers for their determination
As it has done with other fundamental rights, there is no doubt that they must
contradict them in the remaining fundamental rights and constitutional legal rights
protected, as it is required by the principle of unity of the Constitution ”.

The enforceability of the consent of the parties in the judicial processes for the contribution

tation of documents in which the data of the counterparty appears would mean leaving the
disposition of the former, the will to use it, which would result in the impossibility of
to fully exercise their right to effective judicial protection, producing defenselessness
Zion. Thus, the lack of these data or their communication to the counterparty may imply, lo-
gically, a reduction in the possibility of contribution by the interested party of "the media

pertinent evidence for his defense ", violating another of the guarantees derived
of the aforementioned right to effective guardianship and restricting the possibility of obtaining the full
development of this right.

In view of this, the legislator has created a system in which the right to protection

of personal data yields in those cases in which the legislator himself
(constitutional or ordinary) has considered the existence of reasoned and fundamental reasons
given that justify the need for data processing, incorporating said
supposed to norms of, at least, the same rank as the one that regulates the
gida.

As stated by the reiterated jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court (for all,
STC 186/2000, dated 07/10, with the citation of many others) "the right to privacy is not
absolute, as none of the fundamental rights is, being able to yield to
constitutionally relevant interests, provided that the cut that it has to

experience is revealed as necessary to achieve the legitimate purpose envisaged, proportionate to
in order to achieve it and, in any case, be respectful of the essential content of the
right ".

Therefore, the acceptance or knowledge of the affected party is not required for the transfer of
personal data, when the communication is for judicial defense and as

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

recipients to the Judges or Courts within the exercise of their powers,
including the cases in which it is evidence that, although it has not been

Requested by the Judge or Court, they are provided by the parties. The action is
subsumed in the right of all citizens to use all means of
relevant evidence for your defense, in the exercise of your rights and interests
legitimate, without, in any case, being defenseless, as indicated in the
Article 24.2 of the Constitutional text that prevails in this case, also considering

that the personal data of the claimant was already known by the defendant because it was the
counterpart of a demand for quantity against them, and the document contained the
reasons for the denial of the precautionary measures that he requested, so that with
his transfer does not reveal intimate data of the claimant nor was his identity
unknown to ADGEST.

In the present case, the analysis carried out on the documents provided and the
concurrent circumstances, there are no indications of infringement in the field
competence of this AEPD.

Therefore, in accordance with the provisions, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, IT IS AGREED:

FIRST: PROCEED WITH THE FILING of these actions.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to the claimant and claimed.

In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.

the art. 114.1.c) of Law 39/2015, of 1/10, of the Common Administrative Procedure of
the Public Administrations, (LPCAP) and in accordance with the provisions of the
arts. 112 and 123 of the same Law, the interested parties may file, optionally,
