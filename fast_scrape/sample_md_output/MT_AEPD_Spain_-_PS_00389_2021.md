## English Summary

### Facts

A case was filed against LA OFICINA BAR for installing two video surveillance cameras oriented towards a public street and not towards their private area, thus surveilling the movement of all citizens circulating on the street.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) recalled that the installation of this type of device must be accompanied by a mandatory information sign, indicating the purposes and the person responsible for the processing of personal data, if applicable. In any case, the cameras must be oriented towards private areas, to avoid intimidating neighborhoods with this type of device, as well as surveilling public transit areas without a justified cause. The AEPD held that this type of device cannot be used to obtain images of public space, as this is the exclusive competence of the State Security Forces and Corps.

The AEPD considered that, in accordance with the evidence available in the procedure, the defendant had two video-surveillance cameras that affect a public traffic area without a justified reason. Therefore the DPA imposed a fine of €1500 on LA OFICINA BAR for violating the data minimisation principle under [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR").

        “Installation of 2 video surveillance cameras oriented towards public roads and

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and to re-

solve this procedure.

                                             II

Before going into the substance of the matter, it should be noted that, as indicated in the Agreement of

Start date 09/10/21, in case of absence of allegations it could be
"considered as a resolution proposal", referring to what was stated in the same
for reasons of procedural economy.

In the present case, we proceed to analyze the claim dated 05/21/21 by means of

gave from which the following is transferred as the main fact

        “Installation of 2 video surveillance cameras oriented towards public roads and
not to their private area thereby controlling the movement of all citizens
that circulate on the road. The orientation of the cameras...”—folio nº 1--.

The image of a person is a "personal data" as long as it can be identified,
which can be treated in different ways, for different purposes.

        The purpose of a video-surveillance system is the security of the property

private property and residents against external aggression (eg robbery with force in the
things).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 3/6

The art. 5.1 c) RGPD provides the following: The personal data will be:

        “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed ("data minimization").

It should be remembered that individuals are responsible for ensuring that the systems installed
felled comply with current legislation, proving that it complies with all
the requirements demanded by the regulations in force.

The installation of this type of device must have the mandatory informative sign.
tive, indicating the purposes and responsible for the treatment, where appropriate, of the data of each
personal character.

In any case, the cameras must be oriented towards the particular space, avoiding

transit of the same without just cause.

With this type of device it is not possible to obtain image(s) of public space either.
co, as this is the exclusive competence of the State Security Forces and Bodies
ted.

It should be remembered that even in the case of a "simulated" camera, the same
should preferably be oriented towards private space, since it is considered
that this type of device can affect the privacy of third parties, that they are inti-
measured by it in the belief of being the subject of permanent recording.

        On the part of individuals, it is not possible to install devices for obtaining
images of public space, outside the cases allowed in the regulations.

                                             III

In accordance with the evidence available in this proceeding,
sanctioning act, it is considered that the claimed party has two chambers of
video-surveillance that affect public transit areas without just cause.

        The evidence provided (Doc. Annex I) allows verifying the presence of two
devices that are blatantly oriented towards the public sidewalk, affecting
rights of third parties without just cause, being a negligent conduct to the
effects of the administrative infraction.

Security cameras installed in private spaces will not be able to obtain images
public spaces, the security function of public spaces corresponding to
exclusively to the State Security Forces and Bodies, not to the Companies
Private Security companies.

        The known facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the party

claimed for violation of the content of art. 51. C) GDPR, cited above.
