## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant exercised a right of deletion against the respondent, but his request has not received the legally established response.

The AEPD admitted the complaint for processing and granted the respondent entity the option to present allegations within fifteen days.

The respondent did not reply to the AEPD and did not prove that it had responded to the claimant's request for deletion.

### Dispute

Is the lack of response an infringement of the data subject's right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR)?

### Holding

The AEPD upheld the complaint and urged the respondent to reply to the complainant within ten working days, stating whether it had complied with the right of erasure or whether it had refused the request for erasure, stating its reasons.

In the event of non-compliance, the AEPD considers that this could lead to a sanction, in accordance with article 58(2) GDPR.
