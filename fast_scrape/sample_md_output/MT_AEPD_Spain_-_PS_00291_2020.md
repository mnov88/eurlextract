The Spanish DPA issued a warning to an events organiser whose website did not provide clear information on cookies nor allowed users to reject cookies, in violation of the Spanish law implementing the e-Privacy Directive. The DPA issued a warning rather than a fine because the event organiser was a natural and not a legal person.

## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject made a complaint to the Spanish DPA because they had submitted anonymous comments via Instagram to an events' organiser related a the wedding of a cousin that they had attended, to which the events' organiser repsonded forwarding their comments together with identifying data of the data subject to the groom and bride without informing the data subject first.

The Spanish DPA sent requests for information to the controller regarding the complaint of the data subject and did not receive an answer. In the course of the investigation of the complaint, the Spanish DPA checked the website of the events' organiser, finding that they were using cookies without providing enough information to the users and there was no "reject" button.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA held that this was a violation of the [Spanish Act implementing the e-Privacy Directive](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2002-13758) (LSSI), as the website did not inform clearly about the cookies it uses and does not allow the user to reject them all.

The Spanish DPA decided to issue a written warning instead of a economic fine because the website belonged to a natural person and not a legal person.

## Comment

Surprisingly, the Spanish DPA does not analyse the actual complaint of the data subject which is that the company forwarded her comments and other identifying personal data to the bride and groom (relatives of the data subject) without having properly informing her about it. In my personal view, this would be a violation of Article 13(1)(c) and (e) GDPR.

Furthermore, it is unclear from the decision of the Spanish DPA what is the link the failure of providing appropriate information about cookies in the website of the company and actual complaint that was about forwarding comments and personal data of users of social media to third parties without properly informing the data subjects.
