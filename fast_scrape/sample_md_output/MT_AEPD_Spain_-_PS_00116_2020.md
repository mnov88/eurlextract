## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the website by the defendant did not provide information on cookies, so it did not comply with the data protection.

### Dispute

As the defendant refused to receive the notices by the AEPD, the AEPD carried out an investigation procedure, and it discovered that the website did not offer information enough on cookies (i.e. how to manage or disable them) nor any option to refuse all the cookies. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed its information duties in relation to cookies as per Article 22(2) LSSI, according to which, digital services providers may use data storage and retrieval devices on computers terminals of the recipients, provided that such recipients have given their consent after they have been provided with clear and complete information on their use and, in particular, on the purposes of data processing according to the data protection laws. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) the existence of intentionality, and (ii) the period of time the defendant has been infringing its duties, taking into account that the claim is dated October 2019\], the AEPD decided to impose a fine of 3,000 € to the defendant, and, additionally, required the defendant to its website as per indicated in the recent AEPD guide on the use of cookies, within the period of one (1) month since this resolution.
