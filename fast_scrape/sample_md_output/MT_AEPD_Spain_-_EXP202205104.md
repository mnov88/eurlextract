## English Summary

### Facts

The company Fusiona Soluciones Energéticas, the controler, filed a lawsuit against the data subject due to an alleged debt. In the judgment , a Spanish Court of First Instance dismissed the claim and declared that the data subject had no debt with the controller. Although the decision was final, the controller included the data subject's data in the 'common credit information system' associating them with the alleged debt.

The data subject then filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA, which initiated disciplinary proceedings against the controller.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA concluded that the controller violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

According to the DPA, when notifying the credit information system about a debt that is neither 'certain, nor due or payable', as required by [Article 20(1) LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2018/12/06/pdfs/BOE-A-2018-16673.pdf), the controller cannot rely on the presumption of legitimate interest established by this provision.

Therefore, the DPA considered that the data processing lacked a legal basis and fined the controlle €50,000 for the violation of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

In parallel, the LOPDGDD, in its article 20, under the rubric of "Systems of
credit information” provides:
"1. Unless proven otherwise, the processing of personal data will be presumed lawful.

affected by the inclusion of such data and will inform you about the possibility of exercising the
rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 within
of the thirty days following the notification of the debt to the system, remaining
data blocked during that period.
d) That the data is only kept in the system while the breach persists, with a maximum limit of five years from the expiration date of
the monetary, financial or credit obligation.
e) That the data referring to a specific debtor can only be
consulted when the person consulting the system maintained a contractual relationship
with the affected party that implies the payment of a pecuniary amount or this would have
requested the conclusion of a contract that involves financing, deferred payment or
periodic billing, as happens, among other cases, in those provided for in the
legislation on consumer credit contracts and real estate credit contracts.
When the right to limitation of processing has been exercised before the system
of the data challenging its accuracy in accordance with the provisions of article 18.1.a) of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the system will inform those who could consult it with
accordance with the previous paragraph about the mere existence of said circumstance, without
provide the specific data with respect to which the right had been exercised, in
both are resolved on the request of the affected party.
f) That, in the event that the request for the conclusion of the contract is denied, or it
will not be held, as a result of the consultation carried out, whoever has
Once the system has been consulted, inform the affected party of the result of said consultation.
2. The entities that maintain the system and the creditors, regarding the treatment
of the data referring to their debtors, will have the status of co-responsible for the
data processing, being applicable the provisions of article 26 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
It will correspond to the creditor to guarantee that the requirements demanded for the

The system maintains additional information to those contemplated in said
section, related to the debtor and obtained from other sources, in order to carry out
carry out a profiling of the same, in particular through the application of techniques of
credit rating.”
II
Classification and classification of the offense
The infringement for which the party claimed in this agreement is held responsible
of initiation is typified in article 83 of the GDPR which, under the rubric
“General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines”, states:
"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or, in the case of
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of
overall annual total business of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest
amount:

The LOPDGDD, for the purposes of the prescription of the infringement, qualifies in its article 72.1.
very serious infringement, in this case the limitation period is three years, "b)
The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”
The documentation in the file shows that the party
claimed violated article 6.1 of the GDPR.
The conduct of the claimed party contrary to the principle of legality has consisted of
notify a credit information system (the ASNEF file) of a debt that,
with respect to the alleged debtor, the claimant, was not true, nor expired nor enforceable, as
requires article 20.1 of the LOPDGDD for the presumption to apply
"iuris tantum" of prevalence of the legitimate interest of the person in charge, without accrediting the
existence of such legitimate interest or the legally required weighting. The treatment
illegal use of the claimant's data, materialized in the inclusion in a file of
solvency without legal basis, began on June 28, 2019, the date of registration of the
debt in the mentioned file.
The claimant has provided a ruling from the Court of First Instance number X of
\*\*\*LOCATION.1 Verbal Trial XXX/2020 Judgment: 00XXX/2021 before the party
claimed, as well as a report of inclusion in the Asnef system dated March 22
of 2022 in which your personal data is registered by the entity
claimed, with discharge date June 28, 2019.
As Recital 40 of the GDPR clearly states “..For the treatment to be
lawful, personal data must be processed with the consent of the interested party or
on some other legitimate basis established in accordance with the Law, either in the
this Regulation or by virtue of another Law of the Union or of the States
Member States referred to in this Regulation, including the need to comply with the
legal obligation applicable to the data controller or the need to execute a
contract in which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures at the request
of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a contract.”
IV. Sanction
In order to establish the administrative fine that should be imposed, the following
provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, which state:
"1. Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative proceedings under this article for violations of this
Regulations indicated in sections 4, 5 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, in addition to or in lieu of the measures contemplated in
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case shall be duly taken into account:
a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
have suffered;
b) intentionality or negligence in the infraction;
c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to
alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;
d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor,
taking into account the technical or organizational measures that they have applied under
of articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous infringement committed by the controller or processor;
f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the
infringement and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the infringement;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
particular whether the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so, in what
extent;
i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been ordered
previously against the person in charge or the person in charge in relation to the
same matter, compliance with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms of
certification approved in accordance with article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or
indirectly, through infringement.
In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the GDPR, the LOPDGDD, in its article 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures" establishes that:
"2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:
a) The continuing nature of the offence.
b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of data processing.
personal information.
c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.
d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have led to the commission
of the offence.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the
violation, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.
f) The affectation of the rights of minors.
g) Have, when it is not mandatory, a data protection delegate.
h) Submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between those and any interested party.”
In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed in the present case for the infraction typified in article 83.5.a)
of the GDPR for which the claimed party is held responsible, are considered concurrent
the following aggravating factors:
- The evident link between the business activity of the defendant and the
treatment of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the
GDPR in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD).
 The Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), in which,
with respect to entities whose activity entails the continuous processing of
customer data, indicates that "...the Supreme Court has understood that
recklessness exists whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is
that is, when the offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in the
assessment of the degree of diligence, special consideration must be given to the
professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case now
examined, when the appellant's activity is constant and abundant
handling of personal data must insist on rigor and exquisite
Be careful to comply with the legal provisions in this regard.”
The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the GDPR, with
regarding the offense committed by violating the provisions of article 6.1 of the
GDPR allows a penalty of 50,000 euros (fifty thousand euros) to be set.
Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria of
