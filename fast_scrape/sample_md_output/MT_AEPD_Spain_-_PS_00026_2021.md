## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant filed a complaint as they received a commercial call on behalf of "Vodafone España, SAU" despite being listed on the Robinson List (advertising exclusion list).

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) therefore began an investigation to clarify the facts at stake. This revealed that Vamavi Phone SL was responsible for the data processing. Vamavi had made the commercial call to the Claimant on behalf of Vodafone España, SAU.

### Dispute

Does a commercial call made by a processor to a claimant on the Robinson List entail a breach of Article 48(1) LGT, Article 21 GDPR in link with Article 23 LOPDGDD and Article 28 GDPR?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) held that the facts in question indicated a breach of Article 48(1)(b) of the Spanish Law on General Telecommunications (LGT) by Vamavi. This provision outlines that individuals have the right to oppose receiving unwanted calls for commercial communication purposes. The DPA went on to outline that this must be read in light of Article 21 GDPR (right to object) and Article 23 of the Spanish Law on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD).

The DPA held that by acting on behalf of Vodafone, Vamavi acted as a data processor within the meaning of Article 28 GDPR. Vamavi was nonetheless the one found responsible for the data processing in question.

As Vamavi made a voluntary, early and guilty payment, the fine paid was reduced to €24,000 (rather than the original fine of €40,000).

(…)

b) To oppose receiving unwanted calls for commercial communication purposes

data protection rules that regulate the right of opposition: article

04/27/2016, regarding the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the

III

## Article 28 of the RGPD establishes the following:

In charge of the treatment

<1. When a treatment is to be carried out on behalf of a person responsible for the

treatment is in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation and guarantees the

protection of the rights of the interested party.

2. The person in charge of the treatment will not resort to another person in charge without prior authorization

in writing, specific or general, of the person in charge. In the latter case, the manager

replacement of other managers, thus giving the person in charge the opportunity to oppose
to such changes.

third country or an international organization, unless it is obliged to do so under

certain processing activities on behalf of the controller, will be imposed on
this other person in charge, through a contract or other legal act established in accordance with

so that the treatment is in accordance with the provisions of this
Regulation. If that other manager breaches their data protection obligations,

treatment with regard to the fulfillment of the obligations of the other

in charge.

5. Adherence of the data controller to a code of conduct approved by

pursuant to article 40 or to a certification mechanism approved pursuant to article
42 may be used as an element to demonstrate the existence of guarantees
