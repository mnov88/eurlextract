## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against the Local Police of the Municipal Council of La Puebla del Río, Seville after a police officer took a photograph of their ID with a cell phone. The data subject claimed that the device was privately owned by the police officer.

The context involved restrictive measures due to the Covid 19 pandemic, and the City of La Puebla del Río had its perimeter closed, with entry and exit controls for vehicles. The police officers managed to identify that the data subject was from a different location, and their ID was required and photographed, based on public safety regulatory legislation. The device was actually owned by the police unit, and was not the private property of the agent. Upon completion of police registration procedure, the photograph was removed from the device.

The purpose of taking the photograph was to obtain an image of the ID without physically handling it, and carry out the necessary checks in accordance with Article 16 of the Spanish Citizen Safety Law (_[Ley Orgánica 4/2015, de 30 de marzo, de protección de la seguridad ciudadana](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-3442)_) to comply with specific health and security measures in the context of the pandemic.

### Holding

The AEPD held that as long as data protection principles in the GDPR and the Spanish Data Protection Act (_[Ley Orgánica 3/2018 Ley Orgánica 3/2018 de Protección de Datos Personales y Garantía de los Derechos Digitales - LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673)_) were observed, state security bodies could process data to achieve their inherent objectives, including prevention, investigation, detection or repression of criminal offenses. The AEPD concluded that in this case, given the exceptional context related to the pandemic, a police agent's use of a cell phone which is owned by the police unit to photograph ID documents complied with the security measures established in [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"), and therefore dismissed the case.

As established in section III of the "Preamble" of Organic Law 4/2015, of

March 30, protection of citizen security (LOPSC), "(...) the
competent authorities to agree on different actions aimed at the
maintenance and, where appropriate, the restoration of citizen tranquility in
assumptions of public insecurity, regulating with precision the budgets, the
and the requirements to carry out these procedures, in accordance with the principles, among

others, of proportionality, minimal interference and non-discrimination (...)”.

And so they are established in articles 9.2 and 16.1 of the LOPSC, regarding the obligation
to display and allow verification of the DNI by agents of the Forces and
State Security Corps:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 4/6

In article 9, on the obligations and rights of the holder of the National Document
of Identity, indicates that:

"two. All persons required to obtain the National Identity Document
they are also to exhibit it and allow the verification of the security measures to
those referred to in section 2 of article 8 when required to do so by the

of article 16. You must report your theft or loss as soon as possible.

possible to the nearest Police station or post of the Security Forces and Bodies
next".

In its article 16, on the identification of persons, it is established that:

1. In the fulfillment of its functions of criminal investigation and prevention, as well as
for the sanction of penal and administrative infractions, the agents of the Forces
and Security Bodies may require the identification of the persons in the
following assumptions: a) When there are indications that they may have participated in the
commission of an offence. b) When, in view of the concurrent circumstances,
it is considered reasonably necessary to prove their identity to prevent the

commission of a crime. In these cases, the agents may carry out the
necessary checks on public roads or in the place where the
requirement, including the identification of persons whose face is not fully visible
or partially for using any type of garment or object that covers it, preventing or
making identification difficult, when necessary for the indicated purposes.

In the practice of identification, the principles of
proportionality, equal treatment and non-discrimination based on birth,
nationality, racial or ethnic origin, sex, religion or belief, age, disability,
sexual orientation or identity, opinion or any other condition or circumstance

personal or social.

Therefore, the State Security Forces and Bodies can process the data
of citizens for the prevention, investigation, detection or
prosecution of criminal offenses and for the performance of the functions of
public interest that are their own. However, these treatments must be

carried out respecting at all times, what is established in the regulations in force in
matter of protection of personal data, the RGPD and the LOPDGDD,
respectively.

The GDPR, in its article 32, requires data controllers to adopt

the corresponding security measures of a technical and organizational nature
necessary to guarantee that the treatment is in accordance with current regulations, as well as
such as ensuring that any person acting under the authority of the controller or
of the person in charge and has access to personal data, they can only be processed following their
instructions.

Thus, in the present case, the collection of the personal data of a citizen for its
identification, by the agents of the Local Police, must be carried out with

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 5/6

technical and organizational methods that guarantee the security and confidentiality of
these, following the instructions of the data controller.

In the present case, the Local Police of Puebla del Rio affirms that said photograph
was made with an official mobile phone belonging to the Local Police Headquarters
with the sole purpose of taking an image of the identity document and with it
carry out the appropriate checks in accordance with article 16 of LO 4/2015, of
March 30, protection of citizen security, avoiding the manipulation of the
document, thereby complying with the health security measures established by

the exceptional situation that was taking place.

In addition to all this, we must take into account the fact that it was advised
take extreme precautions and speed up interventions as much as possible due to the situation
health emergency, using an exceptional means of identification such as

take pictures with an official mobile phone belonging to the Local Police,
made it possible, in the identification work, to reduce the interpersonal contact between the
identified person and agents. All this together with the fact that, once the
necessary verifications in the identification, the images taken with the mobile
were erased without leaving any trace in any police file, according to
confirms the police themselves.

Therefore, based on the evidence available at this time,
considers that the use of the official mobile phone of the acting unit for the decision
of a photograph of the claimant's DNI complies with the security measures that
marks article 32 of the RGPD, in the exceptional situation that was being
