## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was a member of an a community of owners, the controller. They complained with the president of the community association about video recordings in which they appeared.

Subsequently, the president shared these videos in a WhatsApp group with other neighbours.

The data subject then filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA, claiming that the controller violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality while processing their personal data, in breach of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR").

During the procedure, the controller alleged that it was an individual conduct of its president, so only the individual could be held liable, not the legal person.

### Holding

The DPA dismissed the controller's argument by stating that the community was acting as the controller as it jointly: a) approved the installation of the cameras, b) determined the purpose of the processing, and c) established the means to carry out said processing.

It also stated that holding the president responsible individually was an issue to be carried out internally by the supervisory body of the community through mechanisms provided for in the Spanish Horizontal Property Law (HPL).

Therefore, [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") was considered violated by the community of owners as a whole and a fine according to [Article 83(5) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#5 "Article 83 GDPR") was imposed.

When determining the amount, the DPA took the director’s individual action as well as the communal responsibility into account and issued a fine of €2,000 for the violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") as classified under [Article 83(5) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#5 "Article 83 GDPR").

## Article 13 of the LPH (Law 49/1960, July 21) "The governing bodies of

The petitioners acknowledge the facts (folio no. 1 Statement of allegations 10/11/22).

LPH (vgr. art. 14 LPH).

       The management of the President and other positions of the Community may have
consequences at the legal level if it is not done diligently, even if there are
when they use their position and authority to make decisions or behaviors

that may not be convenient for the Community of owners.

       The question of an alleged civil or criminal liability for damages

a question that, in its case, is the responsibility of all the owners of the property, exercising
in his case against the same the legal actions that are deemed pertinent in-
even in the case of an alleged abuse of power.

       Of the set of allegations and evidence provided, recognized by the re-

claimed, it can be concluded that there has been an access not protected by law to the
images (data) from the video surveillance system installed, which allowed the capture
of a community space without justified cause for access and dissemination of these
in the exposed form.

The known facts are therefore constitutive of an infringement, attributable to the
claimed party, for violation of article 5.1 letter f) RGPD, previously cited.

       When motivating the sanction, it is taken into account that it is a person

responsibilities of his position in the Community of owners, who has agreed to the
