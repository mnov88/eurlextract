## English Summary

### Facts

The first complaint concerned a breach of the provisions concerning the control of the computer during the data subject's work and the second complaint concerned the failure to comply with the right of access. The employer (the controller) processed personal data of the employees on the basis of their contractual relationship and, in exercising its managerial right for the proper functioning of the organisation.

### Holding

The DPA stated that employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a workplace, which is not removed by the fact that they use equipment, communications devices or any other professional facilities and infrastructure (e.g. electronic communications network, Wi-Fi, corporate e-mail addresses, etc.) of the employer. The fact that the public employer may be the owner of the means of electronic communication (e.g. computers) does not lead to a a denial of the employees' right to data protection.

According to the DPA, the controller was entitled to exercise control over the electronic means of communication provided to the employees for their work, provided that the relevant processing, was subject to the principle of proportionality, necessary for the fulfilment of the legitimate interest of the interest it pursues and provided that this clearly outweighs the rights and interests of the worker, without prejudice to the fundamental rights and interests of the worker, and their fundamental freedoms.

In conclusion, the DPA found an infringement of, among others, the principles of legality, transparency and security under [Article 5(1)(a) and (f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), and Article 32(1)(2) GDPR, as well as failure to satisfy the right of access. The DPA imposed a €35,000 fine on the controller.

every day to meet official needs in a different place from the one she worked on every day.
On that day, as stated in the complaint, a check was carried out by the former administrator
on the office computer used by the complainant, during which she was not present and had
not received any oral or written information about the check and whether it concerned all
the computers in the service. Subsequently, on ..., the complainant received a summons No
... from the Director of Internal Affairs X to apologise, stating that, during a check of the
website visit history of the service computer she was using, she was found to have visited
social networking and entertainment websites several times during her working hours,
constituting disciplinary misconduct, by which the complainant was made aware of the
check carried out on the service computer she was using. On ..., the complainant submitted
complaint No. ... to the Director, following which she received the Extract of the Day of ...,
which was the subject of a disciplinary measure.
The Authority, in the framework of its examination of the above complaint, sent to the

Authority replied to the letter No. C/EX/6429-1/07-10-2020. C/EIS/6905/09-10-2020, it
stated, inter alia, that because on ... there was a need to process a fire safety case, the
Commander went to the complainant's office to use the protocol application to search for a
pending case on the Fire Safety Department's computer and found that the computer was
open in standby and power saving mode and immediately with the first movement of the
cursor, personal social networking and entertainment pages appeared on the screen, in a
large number of parallel open tabs and performed a history search to ascertain when the
pages had been open. It was also reported that the computer in question is not personal but
is intended to serve official needs, with programs and applications necessary for the affairs
of the Office. Finally, the Governor requested that the Authority inform him whether it is a
violation of personal data for a Head or Head of Service to access an official computer and
whether the permission of an employee is required for the Head of Service to use any of the
computers belonging to an agency.
