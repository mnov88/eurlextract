## English Summary

### Facts

This decision was adopted in the context of the cookie banner mass complaints filed by the NGO _noyb_.

In 2021, the data subject visited a website managed by the controller. According to the data subject, the cookie banner designed to collect users’ consent did not comply with the GDPR. In particular, there was no option to reject cookies on the first layer of the banner, but only a link to a second layer. Moreover, the design of the banner was deceptive. Finally, the controller had not implemented a floating button to withdraw consent, in violation of [Article 7(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#3 "Article 7 GDPR"), which states that it shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.

After the data subject lodged a complaint with the Berlin DPA, the controller changed the design of the cookie banner. More precisely, the link to reject cookies was moved from the explanatory text to a more visible area of the banner. The controller also provided a link on the bottom of the webpage, from where it was possible to open the second layer of the cookie banner and withdraw consent. This was not a floating button. Finally, the controller deleted all the data concerning the data subject.

### Holding

The Berlin DPA stressed that the collection of a valid consent shall meet the requirements set in [Article 7 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR "Article 7 GDPR").

Concerning the existence of a rejection button on the first layer of the banner (‘violation type A’ according to the EDPB cookie banner task force), the DPA clarified that such an option is necessary only insofar as the cookie banner prevents the user from interacting with the webpage. In the case at issue, both 'accept' and 'reject' option were provided in the first layer, despite their different design. Therefore, violation type A did not occur.

Concerning the alleged deceptive design (‘violation types C, D, E’), the DPA stressed that [Article 4(11) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#11 "Article 4 GDPR") requires that consent collected by the controller shall be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. In particular, ‘freely given’ means that the rejection of consent shall not entail an extra effort by the data subject, as in the case of a reject-button on a second layer of the banner (where the accept-button is on the first), the case of a link hidden within the main text of the banner, or the case of a reject-button which is visible only after scrolling the banner (where the accept-button is immediately visible). In other words, violations concerning deceptive design occur when the option to reject is not clearly offered on the first layer of the banner. That being said, the DPA endorsed the idea that the GDPR does not contain fixed requirements for the design of cookie banners: compliance with the regulation should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

In the present case, the DPA noticed that the controller moved the reject-button from the text to the bottom of the banner, next to the accept-button. It was not necessary that both options were equivalent or designed in the same way. The DPA also pointed out that this design solution was the dominant one on the market and consequently users could find the reject option where they expected to find it.

However, the DPA found that consent was not ‘informed’, as both the cookie banner and the privacy policy of the controller were incomplete and did not provide sufficient information about the processing activities that followed the collection of the cookies.

Concerning the option to withdraw consent (‘violation type K’), the DPA stated that a floating button is not necessary. Nevertheless, in the case at issue the DPA held the option to withdraw consent not sufficiently clear, as the withdraw-button could be find only after a difficult search on the controller’s website. Therefore, [Article 7(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#3 "Article 7 GDPR") was not respected and violation type K occurred.

Notwithstanding the violations identified, the DPA decided not to further proceed against the controller, as the latter had meanwhile brought its banner in compliance with the GDPR.

With effect from December 1, 2021, Art. 5 Para. 3 ePrivacy Directive was replaced by Section 25 of the

The assessment criteria relevant for supervisory purposes can be derived as follows.

          (1) Examination standard for “violation types A, C, D and E”

                                                                                    Since 8 of 17 After your review, the displayed banner did not give effective consent

 Likewise, a rejection function at the first level is not necessary once consent has been given

 The requirements for the design of the decline option are not stated literally

 Consent, in particular the fact that it is voluntary, informed and
 must be done unambiguously.

Whether an unambiguous declaration of intent exists when end users give their consent
via a button also depends on whether they have their true will

could express directly or clearly recognize how the true one was
will can be expressed. The evaluation therefore takes into account how
Buttons for giving consent and further options for action are labeled and

are designed and what additional information is provided.

In order to be able to prove that users have made an unambiguous declaration of intent

have submitted, they must be offered at least such selection options,
whose communication effect is equivalent. If a selection option is presented precisely and
       it creates an immediate effect (e.g. an “Accept All” button) while

the other option is kept nebulous and does not allow the true contrary will

Options for action are offered to grant or reject consent

The requirements for effective consent are not regularly met (OH Telemedien 2021
Version 1.1 Rn. 44 ff.).

                                                                                      Page 9 of 17 When assessing whether the consent was given voluntarily, it must first be clarified whether
There was at all an obligation for the end users to make a declaration, or

mung). If users do not respond to a consent query when accessing a telemedia offering

If you can simply ignore it because it obscures the content of the offer, it is therefore regularly missing
on the voluntariness of consent if the refusal is granted with a higher

effort, e.g. B. in clicks and attention (OH Telemedien 2021 Version 1.1
54, 56 f.).

In cases where there is an interactive element at the first level of the banner with which

Giving consent must clearly be considered an equivalent alternative to the “Consent
grant". What is crucial is that the alternative to consent as such
can be perceived by users. For example, it is not sufficient if:

the option to refuse is displayed outside of the consent banner on the website
or this in the running text of the banner without clear visual or linguistic emphasis

Identification takes a back seat while the possibility of granting consent
appears prominently as a button outside of the body text. Also an identical button

However, the option is only visible after scrolling through the consent text

easily noticeable (OH Telemedien 2021 Version 1.1 Rn. 132 ff.).

With regard to the criticized violations types C, D and E, it is therefore relevant whether 'despite the
selected design, color and contrast settings can be recognized by website visitors,

that there is a possibility to use the banner at the first level without giving consent
close.

The criteria for determining when design options unduly influence users, so that

can no longer be assumed to be a voluntary and unmistakable act
o.g. Banner Taskforce stated in its findings report as follows:

                                                                                     Since 10 of 17 TYPE D & E PRACTICES: "DECEPTIVE BUTTON COLORS" &

                     "DECEPTIVE BUTTON CONTRAST"

                lt appears that the configuration of some cookie banners in terms of colors and contrasts of the
                buttons (contrast ratio between the accept button and the backeround" type D practice) could lead
          15- to a Clear highlight of the "accept all" button over the available options,

                The taskforce members agreed to examine type D and E practices together as the issues are linked
                and raise similar points of discussion,
16. The task force members agreed that a general banner standard concerning color and/or contrast
                cannot be imposed on data controllers, in order to assess the conformity of a banner, a case-by-case
          17. Verification must be carried out in order to check that the contrast and colors are not used
                misleading for the users and do not result in an unintended and, as such, invalid consent from therm

                As a result, it was also agreed that a case-by-case analysis would be necessary to address specifically
                casese although same examples of features manifestly contrary to the ePrivacy Directive provisions
                have been identified

                Based on concrete examples, the taskforce members took the view that at least this practice could be
                manifestly misleading for users:
          18- an alternative action is offered (Other than granting consent) in the form of a button where
                        the contrast between the text and the button background is so minimal that the text is

                        unreadable to virtually any use

                While the design choices above are considered problematic, the taskforce members reiterated that
                each specific cookie banner needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis,
          19-

The statements underline that there is no general standard with regard to the

design of colors and contrasts, but must always be examined on a case-by-case basis.

The members of the task force were of the opinion that only then would a clearly inadmissible

Design exists if a button is displayed as an alternative to granting consent,
where the contrast between the text and the background of the button is so low that the

Text is unreadable for virtually every user. In all other cases an individual examination is required

to be carried out in which it must be clarified whether the users have been blatantly misled.

This corresponds to the assessment standard that the German supervisory authorities already use

Paragraph 125 of the above Orientation aid telemedia have described: “There is no general one

so that there is a certain amount of leeway for those responsible. A behavior control through the

However, it finds its limits where the requirements for effective consent are met

of Art. 4 No. 11 and Art. 7 GDPR are no longer fulfilled. If this limit is exceeded
"Inadmissible nudging can be assumed."

             (2) Examination standard for “Violation Type K”

                                                                                                             Page 11 of 17As a condition of effective consent, Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR also requires the following:
“The data subject has the right to withdraw their consent at any time. The revocation

“Consent must be as simple as giving consent.”

According to your assessment, withdrawing consent was not as easy as giving it
the website operator did not activate the option, a small, permanently visible

to display a "floating" symbol with which the banner can be called up again

(“Violation Type K”).

The European supervisory authorities apparently share this view
following statements from the results report of the Banner Taskforce:

          9/31 TYPE K PRACTICE: "NO WITHDRAW ICON"

                It appears that where controllers provide an option allowing to withdraw consent, different forms of
                options are displayed. In particular$ some controllers have not chosen to use the possibility to show a
                small hovering and permanently visible icon on ali pages of the website that allows data subjects to

          32. return to their privacy settings, where they can withdraw their consent.

                Website owners should put in place easily accessible solutions allowing users to withdraw their
                consent at any time, such as an icon (small hovering and permanently visible icon) or a link placed on
          33. a visible and standardized place.

                The ePrivacy Directive's reference to consent in the GDPR includes both a reference to the definition of
                consent (article 4 of the GDPR) as well as to the conditions of it (article 7 of the GDPR)
34. In addition to the requirements for the collection of consent to be valid in accordance with the GDPR
                andunderArticle5(3)ePrivacythreeadditionalcumulativeconditionsaremandatory(i)thepossibility
                to withdraw consent, (ii) the ability to withdraw consent at any time, {iii) withdrawal of consent must
                be as easy as to give consent.
35. However, website owners can only be imposed that easily accessible solutions are implemented and

                displayedonceconsenthasbeencollected,buttheycannotbeimposedaspecificwithdrawalsolution,
                and in particular to set up a hovering solution for the withdrawal of consent to the deposit of cookies
                and other trackers. A case-by-case analysis of the solution displayed to withdraw consent will always
                be necessary. In this analysis, it must be examined whether, as, a result, the legal requirement that it
                is as easy to withdraw as to give consent is fulfilled,

This corresponds to the assessment standard that the German supervisory authorities already use
Paragraph 60 of the above Orientation aid telemedia have described: “If links

Direct the user directly to the option of revocation and currently none

If searches are necessary, a directly discoverable revocation option can also be found in one

Data protection declaration can be placed."
