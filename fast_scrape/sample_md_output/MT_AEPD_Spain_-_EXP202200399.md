The Spanish DPA fined a magazine company €31,200 for violating [Articles 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), [32](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"), and [33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR") because of a personal data security breach caused by vulnerabilities on its website.

## English Summary

### Facts

On 22 October 2021, the controller, a producer of children's educational magazines, received an e-mail from the individual in charge of its web-portal. This individual stated that an external alleged researcher had managed to access the company's data as a result of a vulnerability in the website. The researcher provided a screenshot as proof with the names of the tables in the database but without providing proof of a data leak.

The controller carried out an internal investigation. It stated that this was a case of ethical hacking without malicious intent, since the researcher had notified the web-portal manager about the vulnerabilities. The database contained location information and contact details of data subjects. This data was originally collected through a registration form. Nearly 470,000 people were affected by the breach. The controller sent its affected data subjects an e-mail informing about access by an unauthorised third party to the database. One data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA after receiving the e-mail.

The DPA started an investigation in the course of which the controller stated that it hired a security contractor to fix the issues. The controller also argued that its web-portal manager had fixed all the vulnerabilities that enabled the unauthorised access. It had also implemented security incident protocols and regular audits and had provided encryption for the stored data.

### Holding

First, the DPA confirmed that the personal data of the data subject had been unlawfully disclosed to a third party from the database of the controller. Therefore, the controller violated [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). The DPA considered several aggravating factors, such as the fact that in some cases the leaked data concerned minor children.

Second, the DPA held that the controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an adequate level of security, breaching [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). The risk analysis that the controller provided was the output of the ‘GESTIONA EIDP’ tool of the DPA itself. With this tool, data subjects, controllers and DPOs are informed about basic aspects that must be taken into account for adequate data protection, prior to carrying out adequate risk management. The DPA held that this tool only provided guidance for basic elements about risk analysis for processing operations and impact assessments. In this case, there was no link between the measures that were implemented by the controller and the risk analysis. Therefore, it could not be held the measures were deployed to mitigate a certain level of risk. The DPA considered again, among other factors, the fact that part of the leaked data was of minor children and considered this an aggravating factor.

Finally, the DPA found that a violation of [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"). The DPA stated that the controller knew it had suffered a data breach on 28 October 2021 and only informed the DPA on 11 November 2021. The controller had therefore notified the DPA almost two weeks after the data breach. Again, the DPA considered, among other factors, the fact that the leaked data was of minor children and considered this an aggravating factor.

The DPA fined the controller €52,000 for all the violations combined. This was reduced to €31,200 because the controller had already paid part of the fine voluntarily.
