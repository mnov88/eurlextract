## English Summary

### Facts

In April 2025, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (Meta) publicly announced that it would use personal data from its users' public profiles to train artificial intelligence from 27 May 2025, unless users object to this processing.

In May 2025, the German Consumer Rights Organisation "Verbraucherzentrale NRW" (plaintiff) brought an interim injunction case against Meta before the High Regional Court of Cologne, to prevent the processing of publicly provided user data.

### Holding

Following a preliminary and summary examination, as part of the interim proceeding, the High Regional Court of Cologne held that Meta did not breach the GDPR or the DMA, noting that this assessment is consistent with the regulatory assessment by the Irish DPA responsible for Meta.

The Hamburg DPA (Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information) stated at the hearing that the use of user's personal data for AI training purposes is legally possible. The court held that the processing is lawful within the meaning of [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), even without the data subjects' consent, and that Meta pursues a legitimate interest by using the data for the training of artificial intelligence systems. He further pointed that the fact that large amounts of data, also from third parties including minors and sensitive data within the meaning of [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), are processed, does not outweigh this consideration.

The High Regional Court of Cologne rejected the interim measure.

Case Number:
Meta May Use Data from Publicly Posted User Profiles for PM 10/2025

AI Training Date: May 23, 2025

Philipp Prietze
Head of Press and Public Relations
The 15th Civil Senate of the Cologne Higher Regional Court today (May 23, 2025) rejected an application by the Consumer Advice Center NRW e.V. against the parent company of Facebook and Instagram in an expedited proceeding.

Tel.: +49 221 7711-350
Mobile: +49 172 9405240

which sought to prevent the processing of publicly posted user data starting next week.

Reichenspergerplatz 1
In April 2025, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (hereinafter: 50670 Cologne
Tel. +49 221 7711 - 0
Meta) publicly announced that it would begin using personal data from its users' public profiles to train artificial intelligence starting May 27, 2025.

Meta operates, among other services, the "Facebook" and

"Instagram." The North Rhine-Westphalia Consumer Advice Center is a qualified consumer association. It is taking legal action against Meta with its application dated May 12, 2025, based on the German Injunctions Act (UKlaG). This affects data from consumers and third parties

in publicly posted profiles, unless users have objected.

Following a preliminary and summary review within the framework of the expedited proceedings initiated on May 12, 2025, Meta has neither violated the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) nor the Digital Markets Act (DMA). This assessment is consistent with the regulatory assessment by the Irish Data Protection Authority, which is responsible for Meta. The Authority is not implementing any regulatory measures due to the facts of the case and has announced that it will monitor the actions. With regard to the data made public by users after mid-2024, the Hamburg Higher Regional Court in Cologne also considers the processing to be legally possible. He was heard at the oral hearing on May 22, 2025.

The announced use of the data for AI training purposes appears, on preliminary consideration, to be lawful within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, even without the consent of the data subjects. Meta is pursuing a legitimate purpose by using the data to train artificial intelligence systems. This purpose cannot be achieved by other, equally effective, less intrusive means. Undoubtedly, large amounts of data are required for training, which cannot be reliably and completely anonymized. When balancing the rights of users and Meta as the operator, the interests in data processing prevail. This assessment today is based, among other things, on an opinion of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) from December 2024, which the defendant has taken into account through various measures.

Only publicly available data that can also be found by search engines is to be processed. The fact that large amounts of data, including those of third parties, including minors, and sensitive data within the meaning of Art. 9 GDPR, are affected does not predominate in the balancing of interests. Meta has taken effective measures in this regard that significantly mitigate the intrusion. The planned processing was already announced in 2024. Users were informed via the apps and – where possible – by other means.

They have the option of preventing data processing by setting their data to "non-public" or by objecting.

The data used does not contain unique identifiers such as the name, email address, or postal address of individual users.

In the opinion of the Senate, a preliminary and summary examination
in the context of these expedited proceedings also reveals no violation of Art. 5 (2) GDPR. A preliminary legal assessment shows that there is no "merging" of data because, as part of its intended approach, Meta does not combine data from user profiles on various services or from other sources with regard to a specific individual user. In this respect, there is a lack of relevant case law. The Senate was also unable to cooperate with the European Commission in the expedited proceedings as provided for in the legal basis.

Today's judgment was issued in expedited proceedings following a summary examination. Different legal requirements apply here,

particularly regarding the assessment of disputed factual statements. The parties can assert their rights in separate main proceedings.

The judgment announced today is final. An appeal to the Federal Court of Justice does not apply against decisions of a Higher Regional Court in interim relief (Section 542 (2) Sentence 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure). The Higher Regional Courts have jurisdiction in the first instance for proceedings under the Injunctions Act. The territorial jurisdiction of the Cologne Higher Regional Court is based on the alleged location of the threatened violation of consumer protection laws (see Section 6 (1) Sentence 2 No. 2 of the UKlG).

The full text of the judgment is not yet available. It will be made available in the free case law database of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) (www.nrwe.de) after service on the parties.
