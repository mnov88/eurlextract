I need to analyze this legal document from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) regarding a complaint filed by OpenX. Let me understand what's happening here.

The case is about whether the Norwegian Data Protection Authority has the right to request information from OpenX regarding their processing of personal data related to Grindr, or if that authority belongs solely to Nkom (the National Communications Authority).

Key points from the document:

1. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) requested information from OpenX about its processing of personal data related to Grindr.

2. OpenX filed a complaint arguing:
   - That their processing is exhaustively regulated by the Electronic Communications Act
   - That Nkom, not Datatilsynet, should be the supervisory authority for this matter
   - There's legal ambiguity between the two authorities regarding cookie usage and consent requirements

3. The Privacy Board (the appeal body) reviewed the case.

4. The key question was whether Article 58(1) of the GDPR gives the Data Protection Authority power to request information from OpenX, or if their processing is exclusively regulated by the Electronic Communications Act where Nkom would be the supervisory authority.

The decision:

- The Privacy Board ruled that Datatilsynet (the Norwegian Data Protection Authority) has the right under Article 58(1) of the GDPR to request information from OpenX.
- They determined that even if some aspects of processing are covered by the Electronic Communications Act, the broader data protection rules in the Personal Data Act and GDPR still apply to personal data processing.
- The Board stated: "The possible legal ambiguity and the two supervisory authorities' possible different views on the use of cookies and the requirements for a valid consent are irrelevant to the Data Inspectorate's competence under Articles 57 and 58 of the Privacy Ordinance to supervise OpenX's compliance with the Privacy Ordinance for those parts of the processing that is not specifically regulated by the Electronic Communications Act."
- The Board concluded: "OpenX has a duty to provide the Data Inspectorate with the information the Authority has requested in its request for a report on 21 February 2020."

The key legal reasoning:

1. Article 58(1) of the GDPR gives the authority to "instruct the controller and the data processor... to provide all the information they need to be able to perform their tasks."

2. The Personal Data Act (Section 23) states that the Data Inspectorate's authority under Article 58 applies to supervision of compliance with provisions on processing personal data in other laws, "insofar as the processing falls within the scope of the Act and the Privacy Ordinance."

3. Even though the Electronic Communications Act regulates storage/access to information in user equipment (cookies), this doesn't mean that all aspects of personal data processing are excluded from GDPR/Personal Data Act supervision.

4. The Board stated: "Although the Electronic Communications Act and the Communications Protection Directive regulate 'storage' and 'access' to information in the user's communications equipment, there is nothing... to indicate that the Privacy Ordinance's rules, such as the data controller's duties and data subjects' rights use when the information processed is personal information."

5. The Board emphasized that Article 58(1) gives a general authority for the Data Protection Authority to request information regardless of specific complaints.

This case clarifies an important point about GDPR enforcement in Norway: even if some aspects of processing are covered by sector-specific regulations (like electronic communications), the broader data protection rules still apply when personal data is processed, and the main data protection authority retains supervisory power over those aspects not specifically excluded from their jurisdiction.

The decision was unanimous, with Mari BÃ¸ Haugstad as the manager.

# Analysis of Norwegian Data Protection Authority Case: Datatilsynet (Norway) - 20/02254

This case addresses a fundamental question about data protection authority in Norway regarding whether the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) has jurisdiction to request information from a company processing personal data, or if that responsibility belongs solely to Nkom (the National Communications Authority).

## Key Facts of the Case
- Datatilsynet requested information from OpenX regarding their processing of personal data related to Grindr.
- OpenX argued:
  - Their processing is exhaustively regulated by the Electronic Communications Act
  - Nkom, not Datatilsynet, should be the supervisory authority for this matter
  - There's legal ambiguity between the two authorities about cookie usage and consent requirements

## The Legal Question
The core question was whether Article 58(1) of the GDPR gives Datatilsynet authority to request information from OpenX, or if their processing is exclusively regulated by the Electronic Communications Act where Nkom would be the supervisory authority.

## The Decision (Unanimous)
The Privacy Board ruled that **Datatilsynet has the right under Article 58(1) of the GDPR to request information from OpenX**. 

## Key Reasoning

1. **General Authority Under GDPR**: 
   - Article 58(1)(a) gives Datatilsynet "the competence to instruct the controller and the data processor... to provide all the information they need to be able to perform their tasks."
   - This is a general authority that applies regardless of specific complaints.

2. **Personal Data Act Interpretation**:
   - Section 20 of the Personal Data Act states Datatilsynet's authority "applies correspondingly to supervision of compliance with provisions on the processing of personal data in other laws and regulations, insofar as the processing falls within the scope of the Act and the Privacy Ordinance."
   - The Board stated: "The possible legal ambiguity... are irrelevant to the Data Inspectorate's competence under Articles 57 and 58."

3. **Electronic Communications Act Doesn't Exclude GDPR**:
   - While the Electronic Communications Act regulates "storage" and "access" to information in user equipment (cookies), this doesn't mean all aspects of personal data processing fall outside GDPR.
   - The Board explicitly stated: "There is nothing... to indicate that the Privacy Ordinance's rules, such as the data controller's duties and data subjects' rights use when the information processed is personal information."

4. **Broad Interpretation of Personal Data**:
   - The Board determined that OpenX's processing (mobile marketing IDs, IP addresses, device information) could identify natural persons and thus falls under the definition of "personal data" in Norwegian law.

## Significance

This case clarifies an important principle: even when sector-specific regulations exist (like those for electronic communications), the main data protection authority retains supervisory power over personal data processing that isn't specifically excluded from GDPR. The Board emphasized that Datatilsynet's authority under Article 58(1) is general and not limited by other regulatory frameworks.

The decision effectively rejects the argument that Nkom should have exclusive jurisdiction for all aspects of cookie-related processing, affirming that Datatilsynet has a role in overseeing personal data protection even when related to electronic communications.
