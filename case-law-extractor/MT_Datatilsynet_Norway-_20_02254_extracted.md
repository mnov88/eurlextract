Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract specific information from the provided decision text into a YAML format based on the given schema. First, I need to understand the structure of the required YAML and ensure that each field is correctly populated.

Starting with the metadata section: jurisdiction should be Norway's ISO code, which is NO. The authority is clearly stated as Datatilsynet (Norway). The dateOfDecision is 07.09.2020, so in YYYY-MM-DD format that's 2020-09-07. The case isn't an appeal since the Appeal field says "n/a," so isAppeal is false. There's no mention of an appeal outcome, but since it's not an appeal, maybe we can leave that as unknown or just omit if required by schema.

Next, compliance: the articles evaluated include GDPR Article 58(1) and others mentioned in the relevant law section. The decision says there was no infringement found because the complaint was rejected, so noInfringementFound is true. However, I need to check if any articles were violated. The text doesn't mention specific violations, only that the request was upheld under Article 58(1), so maybe articlesViolated is empty or unknown.

Sanction: the fine is None, so sanctionTypes should include "None." There's no fine amount or currency mentioned.

Defendant section: number of defendants is three (OpenX Software Ltd., OpenX Ltd., and OpenX Technologies, Inc.). Primary defendant name is OpenX Software Ltd. Their role is processor since they're processing data on behalf of Grindr. For institutionalIdentitySNA and sectorActivityISIC, the text doesn't provide specific codes or descriptions, so those would be UNKNOWN.

I need to make sure all required fields are present and that any missing information is marked as UNKNOWN where applicable. Also, check for any mentions of appeal outcomes if the case was an appeal, but since it's not, we can skip that part. Let me cross-verify each section again against the decision text to ensure accuracy.
