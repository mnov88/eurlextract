## Summary

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) has banned Statistics Norway from processing personal data related to grocery purchases due to concerns about the extensive invasion of privacy. The decision is based on the following key points:

1. **Privacy Intrusion**: The collection of bong data (transactional data about grocery purchases) by a public authority constitutes a significant intrusion into individuals' privacy, even if the end result is anonymous statistics.

2. **Legal Basis**: Statistics Norway's decision to collect this data relies on Section 10 of the Statistics Act, which Datatilsynet argues does not provide a sufficiently clear and predictable legal basis for such extensive processing under the GDPR (Article 6(3)).

3. **Proportionality**: The authority questions whether the collection is necessary and proportional to achieve the stated statistical purposes, especially since Statistics Norway itself acknowledges that less invasive methods could partially achieve the same goals.

4. **Regulatory Framework**: Datatilsynet highlights the lack of external oversight in Statistics Norway's decision-making process, unlike other sectors where third-party assessments are standard for handling large amounts of personal data.

5. **Decision**: The authority concludes that Statistics Norway's decision on the obligation to provide information does not meet GDPR requirements and imposes a ban on processing this personal data under Article 58(2)(f) GDPR.

This case underscores the importance of balancing public interest in statistical data with individuals' right to privacy, especially when dealing with sensitive transactional data.
