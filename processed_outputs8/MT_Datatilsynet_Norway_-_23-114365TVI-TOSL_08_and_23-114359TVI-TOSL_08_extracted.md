The decision involves two cases (23-114359TVI-TOSL/08 and 23-114365TVI-TOSL/08) where Meta Ireland and Facebook Norway requested injunctions against the Norwegian Data Protection Authority's (Datatilsynet) decision to impose fines for illegal data processing. The court dismissed both requests, finding that the authority had valid grounds under GDPR Articles 61(8) and 66(1) to issue urgent measures due to ongoing and extensive illegal processing of personal data without proper legal basis.

Key points:
1. The court rejected arguments about procedural errors (lack of prior notice/investigation), finding them unlikely to affect the decision's validity.
2. The authority acted lawfully in issuing fines for behavioral marketing without valid consent, despite Meta's claims that compliance was impossible within deadlines.
3. Costs were awarded against Meta Ireland and Facebook Norway for winning the cases.

The ruling upholds Datatilsynet's authority to enforce GDPR compliance even when processing activities are already subject to ongoing regulatory review by another supervisory authority (DPC in this case).
