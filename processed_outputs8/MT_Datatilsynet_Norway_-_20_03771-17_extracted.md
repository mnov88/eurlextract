# Summary of the Decision

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) issued a reprimand to Telenor for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by transferring personal data to the United States through Google Analytics without adequate safeguards.

## Key Points:

1. **Controller and Processor**:
   - Telenor acted as the controller, determining the purposes and means of processing.
   - Google acted as the processor, handling the data on behalf of Telenor.

2. **Personal Data Involved**:
   - IP addresses (even though anonymized, they were still considered personal data).
   - Unique identifiers for browsers/devices (cookie IDs).
   - Information about the browser, operating system, screen resolution, language settings, and the time/date of website access.
   - The complainant was logged into their Google account during the visit.

3. **Transfer to the U.S.**:
   - Data processed by Google Analytics eventually ends up in the U.S., regardless of where the visitor is located.
   - For visitors outside the EEA, data may be transferred directly to a U.S. server before anonymization.
   - Even if IP addresses were anonymized on European servers for EEA visitors, other personal data (like cookie IDs) were still transferred to the U.S.

4. **Legal Basis and Supplementary Measures**:
   - Telenor relied on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as the legal basis for the transfer.
   - The authority found that SCCs alone were insufficient due to U.S. surveillance laws (FISA 702), which do not meet EU standards for data protection.
   - Telenor did not implement adequate supplementary measures to prevent U.S. intelligence services from accessing the data.

5. **Infringement of GDPR**:
   - The transfer violated Article 44 et seqq. GDPR because it lacked proper safeguards against U.S. surveillance laws.
   - The authority concluded that there was a clear preponderance of probability that personal data were transferred without sufficient protection.

6. **Corrective Measure**:
   - Since Telenor had already discontinued its use of Google Analytics by the time of the decision, no further action (like a ban on transfers) was necessary.
   - The authority issued a reprimand as an appropriate and proportionate measure to criticize the identified infringements.

7. **Right of Appeal**:
   - Telenor has the right to appeal this decision before Oslo District Court under Article 78(1) GDPR.

## Conclusion:
The decision highlights the risks associated with using Google Analytics for EEA-based websites due to potential U.S. surveillance access. It emphasizes that controllers must thoroughly assess and document whether problematic foreign laws apply in practice to their data transfers and implement supplementary measures where necessary.

This case serves as a reminder of the importance of compliance with GDPR's strict requirements on international data transfers, especially when dealing with services provided by companies subject to U.S. surveillance laws.
