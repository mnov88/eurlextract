# Summary of the Decision

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) issued a decision regarding Mowi ASA's compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The key points are:

1. **Context**: A complainant purchased shares in Mowi through their bank, which acted as a custodian. The complainant was not provided with information about how their personal data would be processed by Mowi.

2. **Mowi's Argument**: Mowi argued that it was not required to provide this information under Article 14(5)(a) and (c) of the GDPR because:
   - The complainant should have been aware through their bank
   - Norwegian law (Public Limited Liability Companies Act ยง4-10) requires disclosure of shareholder information

3. **Datatilsynet's Assessment**:
   - The exceptions in Article 14(5) must be interpreted narrowly and cannot be assumed without evidence
   - Mowi failed to demonstrate that the complainant actually received any information from their bank
   - The Norwegian law gives Mowi a right, not an obligation, to obtain shareholder information
   - Mowi's privacy policy was incomplete and misleading about its data processing activities

4. **Decision**:
   - Datatilsynet issued a reprimand against Mowi for violating Article 14 GDPR
   - Ordered Mowi to update its privacy policy and internal documentation to comply with transparency requirements
   - Required Mowi to notify Datatilsynet of the measures taken within four weeks

5. **Additional Notes**:
   - The complainant was eventually satisfied with Mowi's delayed response
   - Datatilsynet acknowledged Mowi's efforts to improve its compliance after the inquiry began
   - This decision may be appealed before Oslo District Court

The case highlights the importance of transparency in data processing activities and the need for controllers to properly inform data subjects about how their personal information will be used, even when there are legal obligations to process that information.
