## Summary of the Decision

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) conducted an inspection of the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) regarding their handling of personal data. The inspection revealed several serious breaches of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly in relation to access management, logging, and log control.

### Key Findings

1. **Access Management**: NAV had not implemented sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure that only authorized personnel could access personal data. This led to overly broad access privileges for employees.
2. **Logging and Log Control**: The systems lacked adequate logging mechanisms to track who accessed what data and when, making it difficult to monitor compliance with data protection regulations.
3. **Duration of Violations**: These issues had persisted for many years despite previous warnings and orders from the Data Protection Authority.

### Legal Basis

The breaches were primarily related to:
- **Article 5(1)(f) GDPR**: The principle of integrity and confidentiality (personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security).
- **Article 32 GDPR**: The requirement for controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data processing.

### Decision

The Data Protection Authority decided to impose an administrative fine on NAV. The fine was set at 20 million Norwegian kroner (NOK), which is approximately â‚¬1.8 million based on the exchange rate at the time of the decision.

### Reasoning

1. **Nature and Severity**: The breaches were systemic and affected a large number of individuals, including sensitive personal data.
2. **Duration**: The issues had been ongoing for many years despite previous interventions by the Data Protection Authority.
3. **Responsibility**: NAV's management was deemed to have failed in their responsibility to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
4. **Previous Violations**: NAV had a history of similar breaches, indicating a pattern of non-compliance.

### Additional Measures

In addition to the fine, NAV was ordered to implement specific measures to rectify the situation:
- Establish proper access management systems to limit and monitor employee access to personal data.
- Implement logging mechanisms to track all accesses to personal data and ensure these logs are regularly reviewed.
- Revise their overall security framework to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.

### Conclusion

The decision highlights the importance of robust data protection measures, especially for public authorities handling sensitive personal data. The significant fine reflects the seriousness of the breaches and serves as a deterrent for future non-compliance.
