2. **Administrative Fine**:
   - An administrative fine of NOK 4,000,000 was imposed on Telenor ASA.
   - The fine is based on the company's negligence and the duration of the infringement (approximately 15 months).

3. **Corrective Measures Ordered**:
   - Telenor ASA must implement appropriate organizational measures to comply with Article 24 GDPR, including conducting necessary assessments and maintaining proper documentation.

4. **Reprimand**:
   - A reprimand was issued for failing to have a direct reporting line for the DPO to the highest management level for about one year during the inspection period.

5. **Cooperation and Mitigation**:
   - Telenor ASA cooperated throughout the inspection process, which was taken into account in the final decision.

### Key Takeaways

- **Importance of Compliance**: The decision underscores the importance of maintaining robust internal controls and compliance with GDPR requirements, especially for large organizations like Telenor ASA.
- **Role of DPO**: The case highlights the critical role of a DPO in ensuring compliance and the necessity of having proper reporting lines to senior management.
- **Proportionality of Fines**: The administrative fine was set at a relatively low level (0.005% of Telenor Group's annual turnover) but is intended to be dissuasive for future compliance.

This decision serves as a reminder for organizations to regularly review and update their data protection policies and practices to ensure full compliance with GDPR requirements.
