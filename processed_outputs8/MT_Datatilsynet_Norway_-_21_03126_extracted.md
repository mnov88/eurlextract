The decision text outlines a case where Datatilsynet (the Norwegian Data Protection Authority) imposed an administrative fine on Argon for failing to notify them of a personal data breach within the required 72-hour timeframe under Article 33(1) GDPR. The key points are:

1. **Facts**: Argon detected a security incident on June 14, 2021, but only notified Datatilsynet on September 24, 2021—far exceeding the 72-hour deadline. Internal investigations confirmed that personal data (including sensitive salary information) was accessed by unauthorized parties.

2. **Legal Basis**: The violation concerned:
   - Article 33(1) GDPR (failure to notify a breach within 72 hours)
   - Article 58(2)(i) GDPR (power of supervisory authorities to impose fines)

3. **Fine Calculation**:
   - The maximum possible fine under Article 83(4)(a) GDPR was determined based on Argon’s annual turnover (~$215 million in 2020).
   - A fine of NOK 2,500,000 (≈€227,000) was imposed, representing ~2.5% of the maximum possible fine and ~0.1% of Argon’s turnover.

4. **Key Factors**:
   - The delay was substantial (~90 days).
   - Sensitive employee data was involved.
   - Argon had implemented some mitigating measures (e.g., internal investigations, notifications to affected employees).

5. **Appeal Process**: Argon has the right to appeal within three weeks.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Timeliness is critical**: Even if a breach is eventually reported, delays beyond 72 hours can lead to significant fines.
- **Sensitive data increases risk**: Breaches involving salary or other sensitive information are treated more seriously.
- **Proportionality matters**: The fine was calculated based on Argon’s financial capacity and the severity of the violation.

This case serves as a reminder for organizations to prioritize prompt breach reporting under GDPR.
