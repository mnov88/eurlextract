The document is a decision from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) regarding Meta's compliance with GDPR, specifically focusing on behavioral advertising. Here are the key points:

### Key Points:
1. **Legal Basis for Processing**: The authority argues that Meta cannot rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis for processing personal data for behavioral advertising because it requires explicit consent under Article 6(1)(a).

2. **Right to Object (Article 21 GDPR)**: The authority states that Meta's implementation of the right to object is flawed, as it requires users to provide reasons for their objection, which is not allowed under Article 21(2) GDPR for direct marketing purposes.

3. **Urgency and Provisional Measures**: Due to the prolonged non-compliance with the Irish Data Protection Authority’s (IE SA) decisions and the recent CJEU ruling against Meta's use of Article 6(1)(b), the Norwegian authority decides to impose a temporary ban on Meta's behavioral advertising in Norway.

4. **Impact on Users**: The decision highlights the significant impact on users' rights, including privacy, freedom of information, and protection against discrimination, especially for vulnerable groups like young people and elderly individuals.

5. **Legal Process**: The document outlines the legal process, including the right to appeal and access case documents, and emphasizes the urgency of protecting users' rights while Meta complies with GDPR requirements.

### Summary:
The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has decided to impose a temporary ban on Meta's behavioral advertising in Norway due to non-compliance with GDPR. This decision is based on the authority's assessment that Meta cannot lawfully rely on Article 6(1)(f) for this processing and that Meta's implementation of users' right to object is invalid under GDPR. The urgency of the situation, combined with the significant impact on users' rights, necessitates immediate action.

### Key Quotes:
- "Meta’s Behavioural Advertising Processing is not compliant with Article 6(1) GDPR."
- "The enforcement of rights of a high number of data subjects could be considerably impeded due to the mentioned obstacles in obtaining the right to object."
- "The consequences of not adopting urgent measures is that Meta is allowed to process personal data unlawfully in violation of mentioned IE Decisions indefinitely."

This decision underscores the importance of compliance with GDPR and the protection of users' rights in digital advertising practices.
