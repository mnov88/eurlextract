Based on the provided text, here's a summary of the key points:

### Key Points from the Decision

1. **Background**:
   - The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) issued a notification to Grindr regarding potential breaches of GDPR.
   - The investigation was triggered by a complaint from the Norwegian Consumer Council.

2. **GDPR Violations Identified**:
   - **Article 6(1)(a)**: Grindr did not obtain valid consent for sharing user data with third-party advertisers through its SDK (Software Development Kit).
     - Consent was not "freely given" because users couldn't access the app without accepting behavioral advertising.
     - The consent mechanism lacked granularity and clear information about data sharing practices.
   - **Article 9(1)**: Grindr shared special category data (sexual orientation) with third parties without a valid legal basis or explicit consent.
     - Even though some user profile data was publicly visible within the app, this did not constitute "manifestly made public" under Article 9(2)(e).
   - **Article 5**: Grindr failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance with GDPR principles.

3. **Aggravating Factors**:
   - The breach affected a large number of users (millions globally, including thousands in Norway).
   - The data shared included sensitive information about sexual orientation combined with precise location data.
   - Grindr had ample time (since 2018) to comply with GDPR requirements but failed to do so.
   - Financial benefits were likely gained from the illegal processing.

4. **Proposed Administrative Fine**:
   - The authority proposed a fine of 100,000,000 NOK (approximately â‚¬9 million at current exchange rates).
   - This was based on Grindr's estimated annual revenue (over $100 million USD) and the severity of the violations.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Grindr was given until 15 February 2021 to respond before a final decision would be made.
   - The authority emphasized that this was an advance notification, not yet a final decision.

### Significance
This case highlights several important GDPR compliance issues:
- The importance of obtaining truly "freely given" and granular consent for data sharing with third parties.
- Special protections required for sensitive data (Article 9).
- The potential financial consequences of non-compliance, even for companies that may not be headquartered in the EU.

The final decision would depend on Grindr's response to this notification. If confirmed, this would likely become one of the largest GDPR fines imposed by a European supervisory authority at that time (2021).
