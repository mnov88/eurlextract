Based on the provided decision text from Datatilsynet (Norway), here's a structured summary of the key points:

### Key Facts
- **Company**: Trump AS (part of NorgesGruppen ASA)
- **Turnover**: ~NOK 101.56 billion (2020)
- **Regulatory Breaches**:
  - Article 32 GDPR (Security measures)
  - Article 33(1) GDPR (Notification of breaches)
  - Article 33(5) GDPR (Documentation requirements)

### Regulatory Findings
1. **Article 32 Violation**
   - Trump failed to implement adequate security measures despite knowing about repeated data breaches since at least 2016.
   - The risk was particularly high due to the potential for misuse of purchase history and location data.

2. **Article 33(1) Violation**
   - Trump did not report numerous data breaches (misregistrations) to Datatilsynet, despite being aware of them since at least 2016.
   - Estimated ~500-1000 breaches annually.

3. **Article 33(5) Violation**
   - Trump failed to properly document the breaches until 2021, making regulatory oversight difficult.

### Decision
- **Infringement Fee**: NOK 5,000,000 (≈€470,000)
  - Justified as:
    - Proportional to Trump's turnover (~0.005%)
    - Deterrent effect for future compliance
    - Seriousness of violations over multiple years

### Key Reasons
1. **Duration**: Breaches occurred continuously since at least 2016 despite regulatory warnings.
2. **Intentionality**: Management knew about risks but failed to implement adequate security measures or report breaches.
3. **Economic Impact**: The fee is set to be financially significant for the company while remaining proportional.

### Compliance Timeline
- Appeal period: 3 weeks from notification
- Payment deadline: 4 weeks after appeal period if no appeal

This case highlights the importance of:
1. Implementing security measures even when perfect solutions aren't immediately available
2. Proper breach documentation and reporting
3. Regular risk assessments in data processing operations
