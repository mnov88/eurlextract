The document is a decision from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) regarding a data breach involving Bergen Municipality. The key points are:

1. **Background**: Bergen Municipality experienced a data breach due to inadequate security measures, specifically the lack of two-factor authentication in their eFeide system.

2. **Factors Considered**:
   - The seriousness of the violation and its impact on individuals' rights.
   - The municipality's knowledge of the necessity for two-factor authentication but failure to implement it.
   - The size of the municipality (second largest in Norway) and its significant profit, which influenced the penalty amount.

3. **Decision**: Datatilsynet concluded that an administrative fine should be imposed on Bergen Municipality due to the violation of GDPR principles regarding data security and integrity.

4. **Fine Amount**: The municipality was fined NOK 1,600,000 (approximately â‚¬152,000).

5. **Implementation Deadline**: The municipality was given until April 30, 2019, to implement the necessary measures to comply with the decision.

6. **Appeal Process**: The decision can be appealed within three weeks after receiving it, following the provisions of the Public Administration Act.

This case highlights the importance of implementing appropriate security measures to protect personal data and the consequences of failing to do so under GDPR regulations.
