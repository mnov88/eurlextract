## Summary

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) has decided that health personnel should have the right to opt out from being reviewed on Legelisten.no, a website where patients can anonymously rate and rank doctors. This decision is based on the balance between privacy and freedom of expression, with the authority concluding that the current setup does not sufficiently protect individuals' privacy.

Legelisten.no allows anonymous ratings of healthcare professionals, which can potentially be misused or lead to untrustworthy reviews. The Data Inspectorate believes that this could negatively impact doctors' professional integrity and personal lives. Therefore, they have ordered Legelisten.no to introduce an opt-out option for health personnel.

Additionally, the authority has ordered Legelisten.no to delete email addresses of users who have rated healthcare professionals in the specialist health service, as these email addresses may contain sensitive information about users' health conditions.

Legelisten.no can appeal this decision within three weeks. If they do so, the Privacy Board will make a final decision on the case.

## Key Points

1. **Opt-out right for health personnel**: The Data Inspectorate has decided that health personnel should be able to opt out from being reviewed on Legelisten.no.
2. **Potential misuse and untrustworthy reviews**: Anonymous ratings can be misused or lead to untrustworthy reviews, potentially impacting doctors' professional integrity and personal lives.
3. **Sensitive information**: Email addresses provided by users may contain sensitive health information, which should not be processed without a legal basis.
4. **Appeal process**: Legelisten.no has the right to appeal the decision within three weeks.
