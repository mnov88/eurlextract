Based on the provided text, here's a summary of the decision:

The Data Inspectorate (Datatilsynet) in Norway issued a reprimand against the Mission Assembly for illegal processing of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The case involved the Mission Assembly's use of private surveillance footage to investigate allegations made by B against A, who was a member of the Mission Assembly.

The majority of the tribunal concluded that the Mission Assembly had a lawful basis for processing the personal data under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests). They found that the processing was necessary and balanced with A's privacy rights. The minority disagreed, arguing that the processing was not strictly necessary and that there were less intrusive alternatives available.

The tribunal ultimately reversed the Data Inspectorate's decision to issue a reprimand, finding that the Mission Assembly had a valid basis for processing the personal data under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
