The document is a decision on an infringement fee imposed on Oslo Municipality by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) for breaches of duties under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The key points are:

1. **Background**: The breach involved Oslo Municipality's failure to implement suitable technical and organizational measures to ensure lasting confidentiality and integrity in the "School Message" application, which resulted in a significant risk of personal data security.

2. **Factors Considered**:
   - The number of children affected by the breach.
   - The general expectation that municipal authorities follow rules protecting individual rights.
   - The municipality's quick implementation of damage mitigation measures and willingness to address the incident.

3. **Decision**: Oslo Municipality is imposed an infringement fee of NOK 1,200,000 (one million two hundred thousand Norwegian kroner) for breaches under GDPR Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), and 32(1)(b) and (d).

4. **Appeal Process**: The municipality has the right to appeal the decision within three weeks.

5. **Transparency**: All documents are in principle public, with some exceptions for security documentation.

The document also includes information about the appeal process, recovery of the fee, and transparency rules.
