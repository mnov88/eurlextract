Based on the provided decision text, here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Background**: The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) requested OpenX to provide information about its processing of personal data related to Grindr users.

2. **OpenX's Argument**: OpenX argued that its processing was exhaustively regulated by the Electronic Communications Act and that Nkom (the National Communications Authority) was the supervisory authority, not Datatilsynet.

3. **Datatilsynet's Position**: Datatilsynet maintained that it had a general authority under Article 58(1)(a) of the GDPR to request information from data controllers and processors to perform its tasks, regardless of any potential overlap with other regulatory frameworks.

4. **Tribunal's Assessment**:
   - The tribunal found that Datatilsynet has a broad investigating authority under Articles 57 and 58 of the GDPR.
   - The possible legal ambiguity or differing views between supervisory authorities on cookie usage and consent requirements are irrelevant to Datatilsynet's competence to supervise compliance with the GDPR for those parts of processing not specifically regulated by other laws (like the Electronic Communications Act).
   - The tribunal concluded that OpenX had a duty to provide the requested information.

5. **Decision**: The tribunal dismissed OpenX's complaint, upholding Datatilsynet's authority to request the information under Article 58(1) of the GDPR.

6. **Metadata**:
