The document is a decision letter from Datatilsynet (the Norwegian Data Protection Authority) regarding a case involving SATS. The key points are:

* **Facts**: SATS, a sports and fitness company in Norway, was found to have violated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The violations involved:
  - Insufficient technical and organizational measures for data security (Article 5(1)(e) GDPR).
  - Lack of legal basis for processing personal data (Article 6(1) GDPR).
  - Failure to respond appropriately to a data subject's request for access to their data (Article 12(1) and (3), Article 15 GDPR).
  - Insufficient information provided to data subjects about the processing of their data (Article 13 GDPR).

* **Decision**: Datatilsynet imposed an administrative fine on SATS. The fine was calculated as 0.3% of SATS' annual turnover for 2021, which is in line with fines issued in partially similar cases.

* **Appeal Rights**: The decision can be appealed before Oslo District Court according to the GDPR and Norwegian law.
